11/02/2017, 04:53 - Bee: Okay :)
11/02/2017, 04:53 - Bee: Thanks for reverting!
11/02/2017, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Dear Sheryl, 
To be honest with you I never thought of the possibility of this day coming. We tend to take some things for granted till it changes and then it feels like a lot of useful time was wasted. 
Sheryl you have been the life of the youth for many many years now... And I would not be wrong in saying the life of Bethesda. There's always so much to say when there's no longer time to say it. But I'm going to keep this short so that I'm forced to remember the most important things about you :).
- [ ] (don't know if you remember) I miss those days we used to be the ones singing seconds for songs during Sunday school anniversaries 
- [ ] I remember glimpses of hanging around with Josh and teasing you about your convent school xD (nuntheless?) 
- [ ] More recently... My first house visiting and being extremely blessed by God for this... Was with you. And meeting Manju aunty and family was so awesome :D 

If I've been mean to you (and you noticed) just know I truly meant it... 

As a joke. Cause I know you won't take it the wrong way. I'm sorry if it ever hurt you :(.

Hope you remember us all when you're enjoying in exotic places :P
May God watch over you in all that you do and continue to use you as a blessing everywhere you go... As you have been a blessing to all of us
11/02/2017, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: That's the shortest I could keep it
11/02/2017, 13:58 - Bee: Aww Nischal!!!!!
11/02/2017, 13:58 - Bee: It's perfect!! Bound to make her cry..
11/02/2017, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for the delay. I was in college all day. Told parents also to write :)
11/02/2017, 14:07 - Bee: No problem!
13/02/2017, 02:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Debby! When will you be giving the messages to Sheryl? If I can be of any help do let me know 😊
13/02/2017, 02:19 - Bee: Hey!!
13/02/2017, 02:21 - Bee: We gave it to her last night..we completed it pretty late..so we went to her place around 11:45 to give it
13/02/2017, 02:21 - Bee: She loved it!!!
13/02/2017, 02:21 - Bee: We have recorded her reaction
13/02/2017, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! ☺. Thank you Deb!
06/08/2017, 10:10 - Bee: Sheryl

06/08/2017, 10:11 - Bee: On it
06/08/2017, 10:11 - Bee: 😂
06/08/2017, 10:12 - Nischal Abraham: Btw... I was wondering... Is she still using her old number?

02/11/2017, 13:43 - Bee: 😛
05/11/2017, 16:53 - Bee: It was encouraging to see you taking responsibilities Nischal ☺
06/11/2017, 03:19 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby! 😊. Though I do hope someone else takes the responsibility next time :P
06/11/2017, 12:55 - Bee: Hahahaha
06/11/2017, 12:55 - Bee: We'll see
06/11/2017, 12:56 - Bee: 😛
30/11/2017, 02:01 - Bee: Hey
30/11/2017, 02:02 - Bee: Could you write down what you spoke about the elderly during the family hour? Flory aunty couldn't hear what you spoke and asked for it to be written down and given to her
30/11/2017, 02:49 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debs... I'll write it down today. Is it okay if I send it to you?
30/11/2017, 03:00 - Bee: Yes..I'll write it down on paper along with mine and give it to aunty
30/11/2017, 03:01 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Thanks Deb 😊
01/12/2017, 06:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be honest I've forgotten most of what I said. But I hope I haven't missed anything with this... Maybe a bit extra :P
01/12/2017, 06:45 - Nischal Abraham: The elderly in our assembly have always been such a blessing for us. Not only do they keep praying for our needs but I feel they have much better memory than any of us do. 

Vimala aunty never forgets the dates of our birthdays and our exams. During my college exams she'd come and tell me she's praying for each of my exam papers when even I'd forget about it. 

Flory aunty has always encouraged me to take a step forward when I was too shy to do it myself. She's very straightforward with what she says and I feel that's her best quality. Whether it's telling me to audibly worship on Sundays or telling me that she was happy to see my take the initiative... Everything she's said has always been encouraging. 

And the same can be said of everyone else who constantly prays for us, worries for us even when we forget to do it ourselves. It is a blessing to have them as experienced Christians among us
01/12/2017, 08:54 - Bee: 😂
01/12/2017, 08:54 - Bee: No problem Nischal!
17/12/2017, 18:58 - Bee: Weird request
17/12/2017, 18:58 - Bee: But could you ask your mum to check if I dropped my lower brace thingy in your car tomorrow?
17/12/2017, 18:58 - Bee: I'm not able to find it..
17/12/2017, 18:58 - Bee: :P
17/12/2017, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Woah... How did you lose that 😶. Sure I'll tell her to check. Surprised neither Reenee nor Kea stepped or sat on it then 😂
17/12/2017, 19:06 - Bee: Well..
17/12/2017, 19:07 - Bee: I had taken it off to eat the burger
17/12/2017, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... We'll check. Till when are you here?
17/12/2017, 19:12 - Bee: I'm leaving on Saturday night
17/12/2017, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Oh okay! There's time to give it back to you if we find it then :). Well goodnight!
17/12/2017, 19:13 - Bee: Yes. Goodnight!
01/01/2018, 01:40 - Bee: Hey
01/01/2018, 01:40 - Bee: What happened?
01/01/2018, 01:40 - Bee: I mean is everything okay? Rolf mentioned on the group that he's praying for you
01/01/2018, 04:03 - Nischal Abraham: I'm fine now. Slightly sick yesterday is all 👍🏻
01/01/2018, 06:59 - Bee: Ahh
27/01/2018, 03:11 - Bee: Have a nice day Nischal!!

24/04/2018, 13:24 - Bee: Hey
24/04/2018, 13:24 - Bee: How are you?
24/04/2018, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debs... I'm good thank you for asking! How do you do?
24/04/2018, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: P.s. Is there a particular reason you ask? I only say it cause you're not the first person to be messaging me out of the blue 😅
24/04/2018, 13:55 - Bee: Hahaha. No particular reason. Just wanted to know how you're doing
24/04/2018, 13:55 - Bee: I'm alright Nischal
24/04/2018, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool... I thought something happened to me and I don't know about it 😂
24/04/2018, 14:00 - Bee: 😂😂 I'm sure you would've known!
28/04/2018, 10:49 - Bee: Nischal
28/04/2018, 10:50 - Bee: So you have the 6th and 7th chapters of crazy love?
28/04/2018, 10:50 - Bee: PDF?
28/04/2018, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: Nope I do not have a PDF
28/04/2018, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: Want me to take pics and send it?
28/04/2018, 12:19 - Bee: You have the book?
28/04/2018, 12:19 - Bee: Yes please
28/04/2018, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... I bought it since the pdf was a hassle 😅
28/04/2018, 12:29 - Bee: Ohhh wow. Employed peeps

15/07/2018, 18:37 - Bee: No why?
15/07/2018, 18:37 - Bee: Because of the dinner yesterday?
15/07/2018, 18:37 - Bee: I want more!
15/07/2018, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Just asking... Nidhi and Sahil have it bad
15/07/2018, 18:38 - Bee: Oh

15/07/2018, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... Vomiting and stuff.. Haven't heard about anyone else... I'm fine 😊
15/07/2018, 18:38 - Bee: I'm fine too
15/07/2018, 18:38 - Bee: 😋
15/07/2018, 18:39 - Bee: How was Nidhi in college?
15/07/2018, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: She wasn't keeping well... Started there. Then mom and dad went to pick her up when I came for gospel meeting
15/07/2018, 18:40 - Bee: Oh 🙁
15/07/2018, 18:40 - Bee: Any better now?
15/07/2018, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Not really... But not worse. She's lying down
15/07/2018, 18:41 - Bee: Aiyyo. Will be praying.
15/07/2018, 18:41 - Bee: Definitely not going to college tomorrow right?
15/07/2018, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely

01/10/2018, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: Well so I guess it's just Bethesda then. Is Ben free to come? I guess Sahil said he's coming as well

03/10/2018, 06:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'll shortlist and post on the group today
03/10/2018, 06:28 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't forgotten about it :)
03/10/2018, 06:28 - Nischal Abraham: Don't we try to? But so many people are rarely free even on holidays
03/10/2018, 07:20 - Bee: Okay :)
03/10/2018, 07:20 - Bee: Yes
03/10/2018, 07:20 - Bee: There's one on 18th
03/10/2018, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... I don't mind. But I can't confirm anything cause anything could come up between now and then :P
03/10/2018, 07:52 - Bee: You're right
03/10/2018, 07:52 - Bee: I'll ask again on the 16th
03/10/2018, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: Good. Fingers crossed nothing comes up
17/10/2018, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/10/2018, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Soprano for Holy, holy, holy
17/10/2018, 19:04 - Bee: Thanks Nischal
17/10/2018, 19:04 - Bee: Could you send alto as well?
17/10/2018, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: You're singing alto? 😱😁
17/10/2018, 19:06 - Bee: No?
17/10/2018, 19:07 - Bee: Just want to listen to it once. And convince myself that I cannot sing it
17/10/2018, 19:07 - Bee: 😛.
17/10/2018, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: In terms of high or low alto is very easy... It's monotonous
17/10/2018, 19:08 - Bee: Oh
17/10/2018, 19:09 - Bee: I would like to give it a try
17/10/2018, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/10/2018, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Alto for Holy, holy, holy
17/10/2018, 19:10 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal
17/10/2018, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: No problem... I'm glad to hear you trying out new things
17/10/2018, 19:12 - Bee: 😃
17/10/2018, 19:12 - Bee: Also, will we be doing that key change like last time? Or not? There are only 3 stanzas
17/10/2018, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: We'll see about those changes when we'll all meet together for practice
17/10/2018, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: First let's try and get each part
17/10/2018, 19:20 - Bee: Okay
17/10/2018, 19:20 - Bee: Okay
17/10/2018, 19:20 - Bee: Thanks Nischal
17/10/2018, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: You're welcome Debs 👍🏼
17/10/2018, 19:21 - Bee: I'm a little excited. That's all.
20/10/2018, 13:58 - Bee: Soprano. Thank you.
20/10/2018, 14:12 - Bee: Nischal
20/10/2018, 14:12 - Bee: I'm on my way home from the station and stuck in traffic
20/10/2018, 14:12 - Bee: I might be late
20/10/2018, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: No problem... If you feel like you can't come at all then that's fine. Do let me know though
20/10/2018, 14:15 - Bee: No I'm coming.
20/10/2018, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! I'll see you there
21/10/2018, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo!
21/10/2018, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: Do you remember the name of the song that you'd suggested we could teach people for the camp
21/10/2018, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: When we met last to last week
21/10/2018, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: For youth meeting/camp discussion
21/10/2018, 16:05 - Bee: There is a higher throne
21/10/2018, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yes! Thank you Deb
21/10/2018, 16:12 - Bee: Have you finalized the other songs?
21/10/2018, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing is finalized yet... Always welcoming new songs and kicking out newer ones 😊
21/10/2018, 16:13 - Bee: Okay. From the new book right?
21/10/2018, 16:13 - Bee: It'll be nice to learn the ones we have already
21/10/2018, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep! Cause they'll all have it 😁
21/10/2018, 16:13 - Bee: Okay
22/10/2018, 02:52 - Bee: Nischal, are you going for ayc?
22/10/2018, 04:14 - Nischal Abraham: Not for the whole thing... I won't get leave right after the family camp 🙁. But I don't mind going for a day
22/10/2018, 06:16 - Bee: Ahh
22/10/2018, 06:17 - Bee: So.. 9th is the main day for Diwali and it's a public holiday too
22/10/2018, 06:17 - Bee: We we thought of going to Benji and Elsa's
22/10/2018, 06:25 - Nischal Abraham: Won't they be going for the ayc?
22/10/2018, 06:36 - Bee: I spoke to them.. they say they're free on the 9th (Friday) and we're welcome to stay over. They are going on the 7th and 8th
22/10/2018, 06:38 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! That's awesome... I'd love to come. I should confirm with work if I can take a leave on the 9th though... Our Diwali holiday is on the 7th
22/10/2018, 06:39 - Bee: Oh no
22/10/2018, 06:39 - Bee: Do you'll exchange the holiday? Or take both days?
22/10/2018, 06:40 - Nischal Abraham: Take both days... So one will be counted as leave. I'm not going in for work on a day when no one else is coming 😅
22/10/2018, 06:40 - Bee: Okay
22/10/2018, 06:40 - Bee: But you have to come
22/10/2018, 06:40 - Bee: What about ayc then?
22/10/2018, 06:41 - Nischal Abraham: It should be fine... I just need to inform earlier. But that week a lot of people have already taken leave so that's why I need to confirm
22/10/2018, 06:41 - Bee: Okay
22/10/2018, 06:41 - Bee: Let me know whenever you confirm with them
22/10/2018, 06:41 - Nischal Abraham: If the B&E plan is on then I may skip going to AYC altogether
22/10/2018, 06:42 - Bee: Cool.
25/10/2018, 07:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Daybee... The B&E plan is definitely happening right? I'm taking a leave on the 9th for it 😁
25/10/2018, 07:51 - Bee: Sahil merin anf Ashley are definitely going. If I complete my assignments by tomorrow, I'll be going too.
25/10/2018, 07:52 - Bee: But they are going pakka. And if Nidhi finishes packing for the Israel trip, she'll be coming too. Pakka.
25/10/2018, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! You better finish your assignments tomorrow 😞
25/10/2018, 08:55 - Bee: 🙄
25/10/2018, 09:03 - Nischal Abraham: You have to come! You already convinced me to come
25/10/2018, 12:02 - Bee: I will try to finish
28/10/2018, 07:28 - Bee: http://www.metrolyrics.com/try-a-little-kindness-lyrics-glen-campbell.html
28/10/2018, 07:28 - Bee: I think it's not a Christian song..you check it out
28/10/2018, 08:34 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
31/10/2018, 15:45 - Bee: Nischal
31/10/2018, 15:45 - Bee: I need your help
31/10/2018, 15:45 - Bee: Is it possible to edit a PDF file that has been sent to me?
31/10/2018, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: It is possible... But not always in a good way
31/10/2018, 15:46 - Bee: Oh
31/10/2018, 15:46 - Bee: I tried converting it to docs and then edit but since there was a table the whole format changed
31/10/2018, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... If it's a minor change you can find online editors
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Then you can edit the page like an image
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Bee: Oh
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Bee: Okay
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Bee: I'll try that
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: And white out text and write text in that place
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Look for pdf editor online
31/10/2018, 15:47 - Bee: Okay
31/10/2018, 16:04 - Bee: I did this
31/10/2018, 16:04 - Bee: Thank you 😃
31/10/2018, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: No problem 😊. (a lot of college assignments have been my experience in this 😂)
01/11/2018, 07:00 - Nischal Abraham: Did you finish all your submissions?
01/11/2018, 07:02 - Bee: Yes. I'm in college
01/11/2018, 07:02 - Bee: Came to submit everything
01/11/2018, 07:03 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice... So you'll be done today?
01/11/2018, 07:07 - Bee: Yes yes
01/11/2018, 07:07 - Bee: Is there work for me?
01/11/2018, 07:08 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Just glad to hear you're free of work
01/11/2018, 07:10 - Bee: THANK YOU
01/11/2018, 07:10 - Bee: I'm glad too.
01/11/2018, 07:10 - Bee: After weeks of procrastinating, I'm done.
04/11/2018, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Bee: Hi
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Am I disturbing you?
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Bee: No
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Bee: What's up?
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: So it's looking like our return train will be at 3:30 from Pune
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Bee: Okay
04/11/2018, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Is that good for you or bad?
04/11/2018, 16:46 - Bee: It's alright. I don't mind
04/11/2018, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: You won't mind even if you don't have to come 😂
04/11/2018, 16:47 - Bee: No I want to come. And so I don't mind being there for just a few hours as long as I get to spend time with all of you together
04/11/2018, 16:47 - Bee: It'll be hectic but I dont mind
04/11/2018, 16:47 - Bee: Like thaaatttt
04/11/2018, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: Oh like thaaatttt
04/11/2018, 16:48 - Bee: Yes
04/11/2018, 16:48 - Bee: Final?
04/11/2018, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be final after Merin says yes or no
04/11/2018, 16:49 - Bee: Okay
04/11/2018, 16:49 - Bee: :)
04/11/2018, 16:49 - Bee: Why is Merin not sure though?
04/11/2018, 16:49 - Bee: Wait I'll ask her
04/11/2018, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Everyone else is confirmed
04/11/2018, 16:50 - Bee: Oh
04/11/2018, 16:50 - Bee: That's great
04/11/2018, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: And we'll go by the intercity from Thane. Somewhere around 7am
04/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: Okay
04/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: That's convenient
04/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: And faster
04/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: Have you asked Benji about the bus yet?
04/11/2018, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Btw our train destination is Pune junction right?
04/11/2018, 16:53 - Bee: Yes
04/11/2018, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good! I was worried I'm checking the wrong train status
04/11/2018, 17:02 - Bee: Oh
04/11/2018, 17:02 - Bee: Pune junction
04/11/2018, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yes?
04/11/2018, 17:02 - Bee: Nothing?
04/11/2018, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Okay?
04/11/2018, 17:15 - Bee: Goodnight?
04/11/2018, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep tight?
04/11/2018, 17:18 - Bee: Don't let the bed bugs bite?
Beat that.
04/11/2018, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Touché. I guess you win this time
04/11/2018, 17:27 - Bee: 😏
04/11/2018, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Going to sleep?
04/11/2018, 17:29 - Bee: Yes. Traveling to byculla for the first time tomorrow
04/11/2018, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun! Will be praying. I'm also off to bed
05/11/2018, 01:52 - Bee: Thank you Nischal :)
05/11/2018, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Debby... Is Ben not coming to Pune?
05/11/2018, 10:13 - Bee: Hey..no he's not coming. He's working. Unless you can convince him to bunk Saturday. Then we could come together Friday evening
05/11/2018, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... I'll check with him
05/11/2018, 10:23 - Bee: Okay
05/11/2018, 10:25 - Bee: Have you spoken to Benji?
05/11/2018, 10:25 - Bee: He says he'll pick you up from the station
05/11/2018, 10:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... He was under the impression we're staying till Sunday
05/11/2018, 10:26 - Bee: Oh np
05/11/2018, 10:26 - Bee: No
05/11/2018, 10:27 - Nischal Abraham: Well I told him Sahil and nidhi have to go for the Israel trip so it's cutting it too close
05/11/2018, 10:28 - Bee: Okay
05/11/2018, 10:28 - Bee: They're okay right? Friday and Saturday?
05/11/2018, 10:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... A tad disappointed
05/11/2018, 10:32 - Bee: Oh..chalta hai.
05/11/2018, 10:44 - Nischal Abraham: Don't tell me that... Tell them 😂
05/11/2018, 10:55 - Bee: I mentioned it earlier
05/11/2018, 10:55 - Bee: They'll get over it
05/11/2018, 10:57 - Bee: Just checked the chat with Elsa. I didn't mention Saturday. I just said we're coming on Friday. My bad.
05/11/2018, 10:57 - Bee: But this
05/11/2018, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... Benji is fine with it... I don't know if he's told Elsa uet
05/11/2018, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: You're coming back with us right?
05/11/2018, 11:00 - Bee: Yes
05/11/2018, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Tickets have been booked. We'll be coming back after lunch on Saturday
05/11/2018, 17:43 - Bee: Okay
07/11/2018, 01:40 - Bee: https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.16personalities.com/&ved=2ahUKEwicuM2Wk8HeAhUJ2o8KHQkSBMUQFjAAegQIBRAD&usg=AOvVaw2_Qm6iV6j2OMSaNVOTSU5H
07/11/2018, 01:40 - Bee: https://www.16personalities.com
07/11/2018, 01:40 - Bee: This one okay
07/11/2018, 05:25 - Nischal Abraham: 👍🏼
07/11/2018, 05:25 - Bee: Do it now!!
07/11/2018, 05:26 - Nischal Abraham: Ok ok 😂
07/11/2018, 05:26 - Nischal Abraham: Doing it
07/11/2018, 05:26 - Bee: Okay
07/11/2018, 05:26 - Bee: Let me know what you get
07/11/2018, 05:27 - Nischal Abraham: That depends on what I get
07/11/2018, 05:27 - Bee: No no tell me anyway
07/11/2018, 05:42 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/11/2018, 05:43 - Bee: Ahhhh you're the only isfp I know
07/11/2018, 05:43 - Nischal Abraham: The further descriptions aren't all that accurate... I remember taking this test 2-3 years back and getting a different result... I guess I've changed as a person in all that time
07/11/2018, 05:43 - Bee: Read those things below
07/11/2018, 05:43 - Bee: Oh possible
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Bee: I gave it thrice and got the same tbiny
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Bee: Thing*
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Nischal Abraham: But a lot of the answers I gave could go either way... Like it depends on the crowd I'm with
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Bee: Oh
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Nischal Abraham: So I just answered based on my current state of life
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Bee: So this isn't that accurate
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Bee: That makes sende
07/11/2018, 05:44 - Bee: Sense*
07/11/2018, 05:45 - Nischal Abraham: Which would be hanging out with you guys 😁
07/11/2018, 05:45 - Bee: But many of those are general questions too
07/11/2018, 05:45 - Nischal Abraham: So you could say that's my personality when I'm around our youth and church crowd
07/11/2018, 05:45 - Bee: Different than the one at work?
07/11/2018, 05:46 - Nischal Abraham: Probably... I do tend to take more initiative here than at work
07/11/2018, 05:46 - Bee: Oh
07/11/2018, 05:46 - Bee: That's nice
07/11/2018, 05:46 - Bee: I never compared my personality in church and the one outside..
07/11/2018, 05:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm sure you're the same person 😅
07/11/2018, 05:47 - Nischal Abraham: I can clearly make out the difference between me in college and me now
07/11/2018, 05:47 - Nischal Abraham: And the me in school was even more different
07/11/2018, 05:47 - Bee: No now that I think about it, I'm mean at work and college.
07/11/2018, 05:47 - Bee: Oh
07/11/2018, 05:48 - Bee: As in I don't care what the other might be thinking or feeling.
07/11/2018, 05:48 - Bee: We can too
07/11/2018, 05:48 - Bee: This I don't remember
07/11/2018, 05:49 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... I gauge my personality based on my behaviour with the friends around me
07/11/2018, 05:49 - Bee: Same.
07/11/2018, 05:49 - Nischal Abraham: And I've had distinct friends through each phase
07/11/2018, 05:50 - Bee: Because the people at church are the same
07/11/2018, 05:50 - Nischal Abraham: Well thank you for the test daybee! It was fun. Maybe I should try answering based on the person I was in college
07/11/2018, 05:50 - Nischal Abraham: If I recall correctly I got artist then....
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: Artist??
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: *?!
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Nischal Abraham: I only remember cause my friend told me it suited me perfectly...
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: Oh so you didn't give the test
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Nischal Abraham: Or painter... Or whatever person that was
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: We'll all give it again after a year
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: There is an artist
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: I'll give it again today
07/11/2018, 05:51 - Bee: 😛
07/11/2018, 05:52 - Bee: Just because.
07/11/2018, 05:52 - Nischal Abraham: We could give it every year but it can only define who we are
07/11/2018, 05:53 - Nischal Abraham: And as Christians I think the Bible already puts a clear lens on our own selves... So there's not a lot of new info we'd get from the test
07/11/2018, 05:54 - Nischal Abraham: But it can be nice to know who we were... And how we may change through the years 🤔
07/11/2018, 05:55 - Bee: Yeah.. Even though it tells a lot about ourselves, it doesn't have to define us. Just like you said. All of it isn't accurate and it may change..
07/11/2018, 05:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yep yep
07/11/2018, 05:56 - Nischal Abraham: Did you know WhatsApp added stickers?
07/11/2018, 05:56 - Bee: Yes but I haven't updated the app
07/11/2018, 05:56 - Bee: I won't update it until they force me to. I don't like those stickers
07/11/2018, 05:58 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
07/11/2018, 05:58 - Nischal Abraham: You don't have to use the stickers even if you update the app
07/11/2018, 05:58 - Nischal Abraham: What does the stickers look like if the app isn't updated?
07/11/2018, 05:58 - Bee: But I'll get stickers if people send them to me right?
07/11/2018, 05:58 - Bee: I don't know..I haven't seen a sticker on my phone yet
07/11/2018, 05:59 - Nischal Abraham: You'll see them in the chat yes
07/11/2018, 05:59 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/11/2018, 05:59 - Bee: Ahh
07/11/2018, 05:59 - Bee: So I won't update it
07/11/2018, 05:59 - Bee: OH
07/11/2018, 06:00 - Nischal Abraham: What do you see?
07/11/2018, 06:00 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/11/2018, 06:00 - Bee: Selected the message by mistake
07/11/2018, 06:00 - Nischal Abraham: OH!
07/11/2018, 06:00 - Nischal Abraham: Naicee
07/11/2018, 14:09 - Bee: Hi
07/11/2018, 14:09 - Bee: I forgot to ask you
07/11/2018, 14:09 - Bee: How much does it come to per person?
07/11/2018, 14:09 - Bee: For the cab
07/11/2018, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Don't worry about it... Booking the cab through someone Joji uncle knows
07/11/2018, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: Okay 2 things
Please ask the others to carry towels and also would you’ll be up for football on Saturday morning? If yes then get shoes😁
~ Benji
07/11/2018, 16:46 - Bee: No football
07/11/2018, 16:46 - Bee: For mem
07/11/2018, 16:46 - Bee: Me*.
07/11/2018, 16:46 - Bee: I'll sit and watch.
07/11/2018, 16:46 - Bee: But we still have to pay right
07/11/2018, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Football is optional... Towel isn't
07/11/2018, 16:47 - Bee: 👍🏻😂
07/11/2018, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Nah don't worry about it 😁
07/11/2018, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Take care of your train ticket... We'll handle the rest
07/11/2018, 16:48 - Bee: Okay Nischal. Thank you
07/11/2018, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: I still don't know how you're managing the ticket. But I pray it comes through 🙏🏻
07/11/2018, 16:49 - Bee: It will.
07/11/2018, 16:49 - Bee: If it doesn't get confirmed I'll book by tatkal or come by general
07/11/2018, 16:50 - Bee: I'll be fine
07/11/2018, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Will be in touch all the way. Terribly sorry I couldn't convince anyone else to join you
07/11/2018, 16:51 - Bee: No no I prefer traveling alone. I get to think.
07/11/2018, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: 😅
07/11/2018, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Positive thinking... Good good
07/11/2018, 16:51 - Bee: Gotta make do.
07/11/2018, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: You have a holiday tomorrow right?
07/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: Yes
07/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: Are you coming this way in the morning
07/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: You are right?
07/11/2018, 16:52 - Bee: To drop Nidhi or something?
07/11/2018, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Which way? Is there a plan for tomorrow morning?
07/11/2018, 16:53 - Bee: No..
07/11/2018, 16:53 - Bee: Nidhi will be coming to Sahil's place tomorrow morning, right?
07/11/2018, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes!
07/11/2018, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Me too. I'll go straight for work from wherever we're going
07/11/2018, 17:00 - Bee: Oh. Will you pick me up at the slope?
07/11/2018, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: We most probably will be taking a rick.... But I can give you a call when we leave 😊
07/11/2018, 17:02 - Bee: Okay!!
10/11/2018, 14:15 - Nischal Abraham: We have reached home safely. Hope Ashley is surviving
10/11/2018, 14:15 - Bee: That's great! He'll survive yes
10/11/2018, 14:20 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
10/11/2018, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: Btw is all okay with you? You did seem a bit down but I just guessed it's cause we had to come back
10/11/2018, 14:30 - Bee: That and a few other things.. I'll get over it
10/11/2018, 14:31 - Bee: Thanks for asking Nischal
10/11/2018, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... Just know some things are better not gotten over
10/11/2018, 14:33 - Bee: But I can't keep dwelling on it either right?
10/11/2018, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Entirely depends on what it is... Like there are some things that would benefit more by dwelling over it a bit longer than simply dismissing it as soon as it comes along
10/11/2018, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Does that make any sense?
10/11/2018, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: Lesson I learnt from inside out... Just cause its sad doesn't mean it isn't required 😊
10/11/2018, 14:41 - Bee: It does.
10/11/2018, 14:41 - Bee: Yes.
10/11/2018, 14:42 - Bee: I shall use your piece of advice.
10/11/2018, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: Take care Deb! Thanks for the talk
10/11/2018, 14:43 - Bee: Hahaha. Thank you Nischal.
02/01/2019, 06:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! You guys back yet?
02/01/2019, 09:39 - Bee: Hey (insert the meaning of your name here)! We'll be back tomorrow morning.
02/01/2019, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: 😂
02/01/2019, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Praying for your return
02/01/2019, 09:44 - Bee: 😋
02/01/2019, 09:45 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal 😁
19/01/2019, 16:53 - Bee: So Nischal
19/01/2019, 16:53 - Bee: Apparently I'm living under a rock except for Sundays so I came to know today that you're sick
19/01/2019, 16:54 - Bee: How are you feeling?
19/01/2019, 16:54 - Bee: Itchy all over?
19/01/2019, 16:54 - Bee: Do you have fever?
19/01/2019, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Na I'm much better now
19/01/2019, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: All the boils are drying up. I'm still home though
19/01/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: But no more fever or anything. Just a slight itch. And don't mind not knowing.... I didn't really tell a lot of people so that's on me😅
10/02/2019, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: Debbie!!!!!
10/02/2019, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: What happened?
10/02/2019, 16:07 - Bee: Tummy problems. Junk food. Stuff.
10/02/2019, 16:27 - Bee: For a moment I thought there was actually some good news about May and that's why you messaged.
10/02/2019, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Nope... If anything his visa got cleared so he's definitely going now
10/02/2019, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: So you're sitting at home for tomorrow as well?
10/02/2019, 19:36 - Bee: Oh. Cool.
10/02/2019, 19:37 - Bee: I think so, yes
11/02/2019, 02:15 - Nischal Abraham: It's not cool :(. It means I can't come
11/02/2019, 02:15 - Nischal Abraham: But anywho enjoy your day off!
18/02/2019, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debs... I don't know if this makes any difference... But I can take a leave from 06/05 onwards
18/02/2019, 11:05 - Bee: Whooooaaaaa
18/02/2019, 11:05 - Bee: There is no definite plan yet
18/02/2019, 11:05 - Bee: I'll talk to Ruth right now and we'll finalize
18/02/2019, 11:05 - Bee: Nidhi will be coming too, right?
18/02/2019, 11:28 - Bee: Uhhh just so you know, you're precious irrespective of whether you come or not and I wouldn't hold you not being able to come over your head. I just don't want you to get in trouble.
If you can come pakka, we'll all go
18/02/2019, 11:28 - Bee: Just spoke to Ruth.. she said she's free the whole month
18/02/2019, 11:28 - Bee: She wants us to come
18/02/2019, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'll have to check with her how long her holidays are
18/02/2019, 11:34 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby ☺. Thank you for your concern but it's quiet alright for me to take a leave then if I've informed earlier.
18/02/2019, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: If I couldn't have made it then I wouldn't be coming... And then I'd feel bad if you guys don't go anyway. So I hope that as we're making plans if something prevents me from coming you guys will still try to go ahead, okay?
19/02/2019, 05:42 - Bee: Okay
19/02/2019, 05:42 - Bee: Yes. Pakka.
19/02/2019, 05:42 - Bee: We'll discuss the dates today evening?
19/02/2019, 05:42 - Bee: After Sahil's thing
19/02/2019, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
20/02/2019, 01:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Devorah! Good morning ☺
20/02/2019, 01:31 - Bee: Hahaha
20/02/2019, 01:31 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal
20/02/2019, 01:31 - Nischal Abraham: Would it be possible to talk today about the trip planning... It seems like we'll never get to it if we don't take time out
20/02/2019, 01:32 - Bee: Yes
20/02/2019, 01:32 - Bee: Are we going by train?
20/02/2019, 01:32 - Bee: Flights are pretty expensive right now
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yep train is what I think is best
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be more affordable for everyone too
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Bee: Okay. There are a few fast express trains I've been looking at and they still have tickets
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Nischal Abraham: And if we book in advance I don't think there should be too many problems
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Bee: Yes
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Bee: Yes
20/02/2019, 01:33 - Nischal Abraham: Btw where is our destination?
20/02/2019, 01:34 - Nischal Abraham: And also I don't mean we have to do this right now 😅. Whenever later in the day 
(I'll be getting ready to leave for work now so.....)
20/02/2019, 01:35 - Bee: Hahahaha. I might be excited
20/02/2019, 01:35 - Bee: Later!
20/02/2019, 01:37 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. And me too 😥
20/02/2019, 01:37 - Nischal Abraham: 😋*
20/02/2019, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Hallo! How's your evening looking?
20/02/2019, 15:22 - Bee: Hey!!
20/02/2019, 15:23 - Bee: I was sleeping..
20/02/2019, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: Interesting... Sounds like your routine is similar to Nidhi's
20/02/2019, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like I was wrong about this. Maybe we should finish discussions immediately after I've brought them up 😂
20/02/2019, 15:42 - Bee: 😂
20/02/2019, 15:42 - Bee: It is
20/02/2019, 15:43 - Bee: New Delhi and Nizamudin
Both are equally far from there house
20/02/2019, 15:43 - Bee: /or
20/02/2019, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I'll keep a lookout for trains as well. Nidhi isn't sure when her holidays are. Who else wanted to come along?
20/02/2019, 15:44 - Bee: Reenee
20/02/2019, 15:45 - Bee: There are Rajdhani tickets available and it is the fastest. Takes 16 hours
20/02/2019, 15:45 - Bee: Okay cool
20/02/2019, 15:45 - Bee: I'll do the same
20/02/2019, 15:45 - Bee: And I'll let you know tomorrow?
20/02/2019, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good
20/02/2019, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: This too sounds good 😁
20/02/2019, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Btw I hope 6th isn't an issue for you!?
20/02/2019, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: How long are your holidays?
20/02/2019, 15:46 - Bee: It's perfect
20/02/2019, 15:46 - Bee: 1st to 15th
20/02/2019, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... Well have a fun night! Good talk!
20/02/2019, 15:50 - Bee: 😒😂
20/02/2019, 15:50 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal!
20/02/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
21/02/2019, 00:56 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/TYonrMhgLZ0
21/02/2019, 01:38 - Bee: I've forgotten my earphones at home and I'll have to wait for another 12 hours to check this out
21/02/2019, 01:46 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
21/02/2019, 01:47 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. It's just a music video
21/02/2019, 02:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hey listen... I was checking out flight tickets to Delhi as well. It's currently at 3.5k which is not too much higher than the train ticket (3k)
21/02/2019, 02:25 - Nischal Abraham: Would that be a considerable option for everyone? I may be biased cause I'm working so I'll leave it up to you to decide
21/02/2019, 02:26 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
21/02/2019, 02:27 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
21/02/2019, 02:27 - Nischal Abraham: And the plane ride is just 2 hours
21/02/2019, 12:25 - Bee: Hey
21/02/2019, 12:25 - Bee: Can I get back to you in a few hours?
21/02/2019, 13:00 - Nischal Abraham: No problem. I wasn't expecting a reply till tonight. I can only imagine how busy your weekdays must be
24/02/2019, 15:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/02/2019, 15:56 - Bee: 😏
24/02/2019, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: What?
24/02/2019, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: OOHHH!!!
24/02/2019, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: THAT'S AWESOME!! Good job Debby 😱
24/02/2019, 16:43 - Bee: You took 3 minutes to get it. Cool.
24/02/2019, 16:43 - Bee: 😎
24/02/2019, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yeah...
25/02/2019, 02:19 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo... Good morning!
25/02/2019, 02:19 - Nischal Abraham: Could you let Ruth know about the final dates as well?
25/02/2019, 02:19 - Bee: Hi!!
25/02/2019, 02:19 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
25/02/2019, 02:28 - Bee: I told her yesterday
25/02/2019, 02:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Always a step ahead of me 😅
25/02/2019, 03:31 - Bee: Always?! 😳
25/02/2019, 03:31 - Bee: *😒
25/02/2019, 04:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yep always. Well have a fun day at work! I'll get to the plane booking as soon as I make it to work
25/02/2019, 08:03 - Bee: Have a productive day!
27/02/2019, 04:30 - Bee: Hi Nischal! Have a great day today 😃
27/02/2019, 04:32 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you bee! 😊. To what do I owe this surprise greeting?
27/02/2019, 06:07 - Bee: Just because! 🤷🏻‍♀
27/02/2019, 06:23 - Nischal Abraham: And I am very grateful. I'm sorry if I sounded suspicious... 
You have a great day too!! Hopefully see you in the evening
27/02/2019, 07:15 - Bee: You didn't sound suspicious.
See you in the evening!
27/02/2019, 07:33 - Bee: Also, why grateful? Are you having a bad day?
27/02/2019, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: Not the best of days. But I should be fine 🙂
27/02/2019, 10:01 - Bee: Alright 😊
07/03/2019, 11:02 - Bee: It hit me only two days ago that your bag which I used as a back rest in Aromas had your laptop in it. I'm very sorry, Nischal. I hope your laptop is alright.
07/03/2019, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha 😂
07/03/2019, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: If anything happened to my laptop you'd have heard about it a week ago
07/03/2019, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: And its quiet alright... Nothing is worse than travel in the local @8
07/03/2019, 12:02 - Bee: Such a relief to have heard this from you instead of me telling myself the same thing repeatedly. 😛
07/03/2019, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Aww 🤣... Has anyone ever told you you care too much?
07/03/2019, 12:29 - Bee: Yes I've bee told that quite a few times. Haven't found a way out though..
07/03/2019, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'd say it's better to care too much than too little. As long as you're happy with it
07/03/2019, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be coming for the Bible study?
07/03/2019, 13:18 - Bee: I agree. More good than harm has come out of me caring too much.
07/03/2019, 13:18 - Bee: Yes!
07/03/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... See you there 😁
07/03/2019, 13:31 - Bee: See you!
10/03/2019, 06:10 - Bee: When is your IELTS exam?
10/03/2019, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't registered yet... But trying to book for the 18th
15/03/2019, 04:47 - Nischal Abraham: Halo!

15/03/2019, 07:32 - Bee: By*
15/03/2019, 07:32 - Bee: 😛
15/03/2019, 07:34 - Bee: Also, hi.
15/03/2019, 08:36 - Nischal Abraham: When did I send you a Beyoncé song? 🤔
15/03/2019, 09:36 - Bee: This one
15/03/2019, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Oh!
15/03/2019, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Nice one 🤣
15/03/2019, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: I seem pretty dumb right now... I didn't get that reference till you pointed it out
15/03/2019, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Also... Received the money 👍🏼
15/03/2019, 11:10 - Bee: 😎
15/03/2019, 11:10 - Bee: What ya!!
15/03/2019, 11:11 - Bee: Cool 👍🏼
15/03/2019, 11:13 - Bee: ??
15/03/2019, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: What? Can't say hello anymore? 😒
15/03/2019, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: I*
15/03/2019, 11:26 - Bee: 😒
15/03/2019, 11:26 - Bee: Hi Nischal
15/03/2019, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Actually there was something I was going to bring up... But I've forgotten now 😅
15/03/2019, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: So you may go back to your busy life... Enjoy!
15/03/2019, 11:36 - Bee: What?! No!! I need to know now.
15/03/2019, 11:37 - Bee: Think harder
15/03/2019, 11:37 - Bee: Think!!
15/03/2019, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes now I remember
15/03/2019, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: My IELTS is on Tuesday confirmed... Looks like I finally stopped pushing it on forever
15/03/2019, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: Now next struggle is to actually study for it 😞
15/03/2019, 11:45 - Bee: Oh.. it's getting real now.
15/03/2019, 11:46 - Bee: You have 3 days
15/03/2019, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. This is a true statement
15/03/2019, 11:56 - Bee: Study. For 3 days only.
15/03/2019, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: I know I should... But it's the weekend.. And Sundays are the busiest days
15/03/2019, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: I think I should take a leave from work on Monday
15/03/2019, 12:31 - Bee: Yes.. I'm never able to get any work done in Sundays
15/03/2019, 12:32 - Bee: Will you be able to get leave?
15/03/2019, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... No issues there. I'll have to work extra the rest of the week is all to cover up
16/03/2019, 02:29 - Bee: Oh. It'll be wise to take leave.
16/03/2019, 02:30 - Bee: Also, I'm sorry for such a late reply. I had an evening full of assignments to complete..
16/03/2019, 03:35 - Nischal Abraham: Ah no problem. You do you boo... I'm just glad for the chat 😊
16/03/2019, 06:55 - Bee: You do you boo?! What is that?
16/03/2019, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: A rhyme... Isn't it a common saying?
16/03/2019, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: Am I the weird one for using it 😶
16/03/2019, 13:27 - Bee: Oh. Maybe I'm the weird one who's been living under a rock 🤷🏻‍♀
16/03/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Aaah.... I'd rather be weird than not weird
19/03/2019, 01:28 - Bee: Hey!! What time is your exam? And where is it?
19/03/2019, 01:33 - Nischal Abraham: Starts at 9. In Andheri
19/03/2019, 02:10 - Bee: Ahh.. I prayed and I'll continue to pray, Nischal. :)
19/03/2019, 02:11 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you so much Debs!
19/03/2019, 13:47 - Bee: How did it go?
19/03/2019, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't give the exam today. I had to reschedule for a later date... Most probably in April. If you want more explanation I'll give a call since its too much to type out 😅
19/03/2019, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: But if I'm not mistaken it should be your sleep time right now. So I'll give you the deets later 😊
19/03/2019, 23:28 - Bee: Oh.. tell me on Sunday.
20/03/2019, 00:58 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing
21/03/2019, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: All the best for tomorrow! Praying for you 😊
21/03/2019, 17:33 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal :)
21/03/2019, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't know you weren't feeling well. Hope you're better now
21/03/2019, 17:35 - Bee: Yes I was severely dehydrated and I realized it too late. I'm completely okay now though
21/03/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Good to hear 😌. Dehydration is not fun. I had one experience and now I make sure it never happens to me again
21/03/2019, 17:41 - Bee: Kinda sad that it takes one experience to never let it happen again. I'm never letting it happen again either :P
21/03/2019, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😅. I guess I never thought it'd be so serious to not drink enough water
21/03/2019, 17:43 - Bee: I think I knew but thought I was invincible
21/03/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Ah medical people not heeding to medical symptoms 😉
21/03/2019, 17:45 - Bee: True. 😂 We make the worst patients.
22/03/2019, 12:09 - Bee: My exam went better than I expected. Thank you for praying! ☺
22/03/2019, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! Glad to hear 😊
24/03/2019, 17:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/03/2019, 02:06 - Nischal Abraham: So true. But sometimes so difficult to do
25/03/2019, 11:10 - Bee: There is grace upon grace
28/03/2019, 20:01 - Bee: Hey

29/03/2019, 05:44 - Bee: Nischal
29/03/2019, 05:44 - Bee: Are you going for the movie tomorrow evening?
29/03/2019, 05:45 - Bee: Shall we go out for dinner tomorrow after the movie? The 'looking like snacks' dinner that Ben was talking about
29/03/2019, 06:36 - Nischal Abraham: I won't be coming for the movie. You guys go on ahead 😁. If your dinner plans happen to be in Thane then send me a msg I'll try and join in
29/03/2019, 07:02 - Bee: Yes Thane. Somewhere near the walk itself
29/03/2019, 07:20 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... Let me know how things turn out. I'm keeping myself free in case my IELTS date happens to come tomorrow. I've sent them a mail and now I'm waiting for their reply

30/03/2019, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: You didn't go for the movie either?
30/03/2019, 11:43 - Bee: Okay. See you 😄

30/03/2019, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Anyway they're going through the process now. Still no confirmation but things are moving forward
30/03/2019, 11:44 - Bee: Okay

30/03/2019, 11:44 - Bee: Keep me updated..
30/03/2019, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing 😊
30/03/2019, 11:44 - Bee: Oh.. so anytime now
30/03/2019, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: As in I got a mail saying they're in the process of rescheduling. I'd given a preference of 3rd and 10th of Aprik
30/03/2019, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: April*
30/03/2019, 11:46 - Bee: Oh!! Like that..
30/03/2019, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... Now just praying that all goes...... Somewhere?
30/03/2019, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well I've decided if this doesn't come through then God has other plans for me in this phase of my life
30/03/2019, 11:48 - Bee: It does, Nischal.. God is faithful. Theres this verse.. I don't remember I'll check one minute
30/03/2019, 11:49 - Bee: 2 Tim 1:12
30/03/2019, 11:50 - Bee: Also Is 55 : 8,9
“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    neither are your ways my ways,”
declares the Lord.
9 “As the heavens are higher than the earth,
    so are my ways higher than your ways
    and my thoughts than your thoughts.
30/03/2019, 11:50 - Bee: Definitely.. infinitely better plans.
30/03/2019, 11:52 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the verses Debbie 😊

05/04/2019, 14:44 - Bee: 😊
07/04/2019, 19:50 - Bee: Thank you for the fun afternoon, N! :)
08/04/2019, 03:48 - Nischal Abraham: Oh my... Isn't this very formal. I should be thanking you for not taking offence for my mean comments 😅😞
08/04/2019, 04:10 - Bee: What mean comments?! 😛
08/04/2019, 04:11 - Bee: You've been typing for a long time now
08/04/2019, 04:12 - Nischal Abraham: That's so very kind of you 😭. It was a fun afternoon though... Really going to miss Ben
08/04/2019, 04:12 - Nischal Abraham: Really? ... I just received your message a minute back
08/04/2019, 04:13 - Bee: Who's being formal now?
08/04/2019, 04:13 - Bee: By long time I mean a minute
08/04/2019, 04:13 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
08/04/2019, 04:13 - Bee: Yes!! I haven't cried yet. Still waiting for it to sink in.
08/04/2019, 04:14 - Nischal Abraham: I envy you criers sometimes... You can just get it out of your system
08/04/2019, 04:15 - Bee: Yes.. crying is the best catharsis for me..
08/04/2019, 04:23 - Nischal Abraham: After Sahil left I realised what the absence of someone feels like... So Ben's leaving seems worse now 🙁
08/04/2019, 04:33 - Bee: And we've known them our whole lives.. all of you are the only constant friends I've had throughout
08/04/2019, 05:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep same here... Will you be going to drop him off?
08/04/2019, 05:17 - Bee: Yes I want to but I don't know about the travel arrangements yet.. I have asked siby aunty if she is going.. I'll join her
08/04/2019, 05:24 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice... I would've joined too if my exam wasn't the very next day
08/04/2019, 05:59 - Bee: Yes that's alright.. it'll probably be very late by the time we return
10/04/2019, 03:21 - Bee: Hey! All the best for your reading/writing test today. Keeping you in prayers. 😊
10/04/2019, 03:23 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby! I'll let you know how it goes
10/04/2019, 03:23 - Bee: Alright. :)
10/04/2019, 07:44 - Nischal Abraham: Test was good! Thank you so so much for praying!!! It's only by God's grace and y'alls prayers that I got through this exam 😁😁
10/04/2019, 08:17 - Bee: That's great! :)
18/04/2019, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you're not still standing there
18/04/2019, 18:39 - Bee: Of course I am! You didn't wave
18/04/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: I did... From the auto... But you were too far away to see
18/04/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Oh.. I saw your head. No wave
18/04/2019, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: There was a tiny hand in there as well 😂
18/04/2019, 18:40 - Bee: What ya Nischal 😛
18/04/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Be quick to wave next time!
18/04/2019, 18:41 - Bee: The keyboard keeps suggesting 🌊 whenever I type wave
18/04/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣
18/04/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Next time I'll wave properly and loudly
18/04/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: You won't be able to miss it
18/04/2019, 18:43 - Bee: Good!! Take notes from Reenee
18/04/2019, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Okiee... Should you be sleeping by now?
18/04/2019, 18:45 - Bee: Are you trying to get rid of me
18/04/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Is it working?
18/04/2019, 18:45 - Bee: Hawwwww
18/04/2019, 18:45 - Bee: I may not sleep just to spite you now.
18/04/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: But if you would believe... I say it only out of concern
18/04/2019, 18:46 - Bee: Sure Nischal, I believe you
18/04/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks ☺
18/04/2019, 18:46 - Bee: Am I that bad at sarcasm?
18/04/2019, 18:46 - Bee: But yes I must sleep.
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Nope... I'm just good at deflecting it
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal! :)
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight nightbee
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Bee: I'll wear you down one day
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Bee: Nightbee?
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Opposite of Daybee
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Bee: 😶
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Since its night?
18/04/2019, 18:47 - Bee: 😶

06/05/2019, 14:57 - Bee: 😂 it's a feat
07/05/2019, 19:12 - Bee: http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/
07/05/2019, 19:12 - Bee: https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/dotest
01/06/2019, 09:09 - Bee: Hi
01/06/2019, 09:09 - Bee: Oh!!! We have the same profile photo!!!!
01/06/2019, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh we do!!
01/06/2019, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: How did your stumble across my profile pic out of the blue?
01/06/2019, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
01/06/2019, 10:11 - Bee: I thought you were this!!
01/06/2019, 10:12 - Bee: So we have the same MBTI and enneagram. Cool.
01/06/2019, 10:12 - Bee: I was going through my contacts.
01/06/2019, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: I forgot what my enneagram was 😅. I guess it would put me in  one of the quiet ones
01/06/2019, 10:13 - Bee: 😂
01/06/2019, 10:13 - Bee: Type 9.
01/06/2019, 10:14 - Bee: The peaceful mediator
01/06/2019, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... I see they're matching in all the tests now. Maybe that is who I am 😮😳
01/06/2019, 10:24 - Bee: Yes!! I was surprised
01/06/2019, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: You were surprised I'm a mediator? Am I not!?
01/06/2019, 12:21 - Bee: 😂
01/06/2019, 12:21 - Bee: No no. Surprised that I got the same thing in both, as is your case too.
01/06/2019, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! That is surprising 😂
01/06/2019, 12:36 - Bee: 😁
01/06/2019, 12:36 - Bee: Are you coming for the house hopping
01/06/2019, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Didn't make any plans for this Saturday😁
01/06/2019, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: What time do y'all plan to start?

01/06/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Well... I'm still home and it's 5:20
01/06/2019, 12:53 - Bee: That's okay
01/06/2019, 12:53 - Bee: Take your time
01/06/2019, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like we will. Nidhi just got done with her bath. And I'll have to wait till the maid finishes her work
01/06/2019, 12:54 - Bee: Okay cool! Let me know when you leave
01/06/2019, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: Okiee
01/06/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Hey... We're just leaving now
01/06/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Okay cool
02/06/2019, 09:14 - Bee: Do you feel I'm mean to you Nischal
02/06/2019, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: No more than I find endearing
02/06/2019, 09:27 - Bee: Cool. It isn't out of hard feelings. Quite the opposite actually. See you in the evening!
02/06/2019, 09:28 - Nischal Abraham: I know where it comes from Debby ☺. Don't worry about me being hurt by it
02/06/2019, 09:29 - Bee: :) thanks. It's a relief.
02/06/2019, 09:29 - Bee: Now I'll be extra mean 😛
02/06/2019, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: If that's what you want. I may forget where it's coming from if it gets too mean 🤣
02/06/2019, 09:30 - Bee: That's alright. I'll take a screenshot of this conversation and show it to you. 😎
02/06/2019, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
02/06/2019, 09:31 - Nischal Abraham: Sure sure. I'll be extra sarcastic with you as well. I'm sure it'll all work out
02/06/2019, 09:32 - Bee: In vain. Your sarcasm is another level. It'll roll over me.
02/06/2019, 09:34 - Nischal Abraham: Because you don't understand it?
02/06/2019, 09:34 - Bee: Yes.
02/06/2019, 09:34 - Bee: Wait, was this sarcasm too?!
02/06/2019, 09:35 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. It's fine... I'll see you in the evening
02/06/2019, 09:37 - Bee: 😶. Alright. See you!
03/06/2019, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo. How was your day?
03/06/2019, 17:11 - Bee: Hey! It was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary.
03/06/2019, 17:11 - Bee: How did your day go?
03/06/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: The same 😅. I'm trying to reach home early from work but it's a largely unsuccessful attempt
03/06/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Ahh! Where have you reached?
03/06/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Just got home. I was planning on reaching at 7:30 😂
03/06/2019, 17:29 - Bee: 😂 hahaha. Did you leave early tho?
03/06/2019, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Left at 7:30. At least something happened at 7:30. So how many people were you mean to today?
03/06/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Wait, me? Mean? What are you talking about? I'm incapable of being mean. 😋
03/06/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely. You're the sweetest person I know 😁
03/06/2019, 17:49 - Bee: 😂
03/06/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Thank you. Unless you're being sarcastic? Which I won't understand, of course.
03/06/2019, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: This way full of sarcasm 😮
03/06/2019, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Was*
03/06/2019, 18:34 - Bee: 😂
03/06/2019, 18:34 - Bee: So was this
03/06/2019, 18:34 - Bee: Also, I wasn't mean to anybody today. But tomorrow is a new day.
04/06/2019, 01:57 - Nischal Abraham: Good for you Debby. Always looking at the positive 😊
04/06/2019, 03:37 - Bee: 😂. Thanks, Nischal.
04/06/2019, 03:38 - Bee: Have a nice day!
04/06/2019, 05:30 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! Hope you have an amazing day too 😊
04/06/2019, 08:07 - Bee: 😁
05/06/2019, 17:28 - Bee: Heyyyy
05/06/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Could you send the photo of Reenee and I that you'd taken in Delhi, please? The one on the sofa
05/06/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/06/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/06/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/06/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Completely forgot I had taken these 😅
05/06/2019, 17:49 - Bee: 😂😂😂
05/06/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Thank you for capturing these, Nischal 😁☺
05/06/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Nischal, what childish thing do you still enjoy m
05/06/2019, 18:22 - Bee: ?*
06/06/2019, 01:47 - Nischal Abraham: Cartoons, games and sleepovers
06/06/2019, 02:34 - Nischal Abraham: Btw Debby... Do you have the sheet Chacko uncle distributed last family hour? The budgeting one
06/06/2019, 03:17 - Bee: Sleepovers are childish?!
06/06/2019, 03:17 - Bee: Yes. I'll check if Ashley has his copy otherwise I'll get a Xerox for you on Sunday.
06/06/2019, 03:18 - Nischal Abraham: Well the type of sleepover has changed but it is a thing I've been doing since I was a child
06/06/2019, 03:19 - Nischal Abraham: I just wanted a photo. No need to take a Xerox
06/06/2019, 03:23 - Bee: Ahh, right right.
06/06/2019, 03:24 - Bee: Okay! I'll send it after I'm back home
06/06/2019, 03:24 - Nischal Abraham: No worries. Take your time 😊
06/06/2019, 03:25 - Bee: Okay 😁
06/06/2019, 03:25 - Bee: On your way to work?
06/06/2019, 03:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. You must've already reached college right?
06/06/2019, 03:27 - Bee: No, I'll reach around 8:20
06/06/2019, 03:27 - Bee: What time does work begin?
06/06/2019, 03:27 - Nischal Abraham: When I reach 😂
06/06/2019, 03:28 - Bee: 😂. Wow.
06/06/2019, 03:28 - Nischal Abraham: Today I'll probably reach by 9:15. So that'll be my start time for the day
06/06/2019, 03:30 - Bee: Ahh. You can leave when you finish for the day or have to stay back a set number of hours?
06/06/2019, 03:31 - Nischal Abraham: Ideally it's 9 hours. But it never works out ideally.
So I try to get out by 5:30. But if there's a lot of work then I have to stay back longer till it's done
06/06/2019, 03:32 - Nischal Abraham: Generally everyone works for 8 on regular days... Cause the hectic days become 10-11 hours of work
06/06/2019, 03:42 - Bee: Oh..do you enjoy this job?
06/06/2019, 03:48 - Nischal Abraham: It's fun 😁. But since college I've only experienced this one specialization that I'm working on. Idk about everything else I could do that might be better
06/06/2019, 03:50 - Nischal Abraham: And as long as I'm in this job I'll be stuck with what I'm doing. I don't want to regret not having explored more
06/06/2019, 11:57 - Bee: Hey! Had a packed day. Just checked my phone.
06/06/2019, 11:59 - Bee: Yes, I know what you mean.
06/06/2019, 12:00 - Bee: I'm glad the Ireland thing is going forward. Keeping you in prayers, Nischal. :)
06/06/2019, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debs. Really need it. I myself have mixed feelings about the whole thing but I guess that's only natural
06/06/2019, 20:10 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/06/2019, 20:13 - Bee: Oh.. I'll pray about this too.
06/06/2019, 20:13 - Bee: As long as it is for God's glory.
07/06/2019, 06:35 - Nischal Abraham: Thank yu!! Sorry for the trouble 😁
07/06/2019, 08:50 - Bee: No trouble at all 😃
23/06/2019, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: God is always faithful in giving his children all they need. He calls us to cast out burdens on Him. All things we always know but it never hurts to hear again.
I've prayed and will be praying for your exams Debby. Hope you're not too stressed 😁
23/06/2019, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe you won't even see this message since you'll be studying. I'll leave this here for whenever you get to see it
23/06/2019, 17:16 - Bee: Yes, truths that I know but sometimes find it hard to believe in. Thank you for the prayers, Nischal. It means a lot. I am a little anxious.
29/06/2019, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Done?
29/06/2019, 11:38 - Bee: Yes. Thank you for praying, Nischal. :)
29/06/2019, 11:39 - Bee: Please continue to pray tho. For the results...
29/06/2019, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely 😊. Hope they went well
29/06/2019, 17:44 - Bee: One went well, one was alright, the last one was a bit tough. Not worrying about it. All in God's hands.
02/07/2019, 17:09 - Bee: Hey. Relished the afternoon all of spent together. Those little ones are a joy to be around! And you're good with kids! 
Goodnight, Nischal. 😃
02/07/2019, 17:09 - Bee: All of us*
02/07/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Those little ones are definitely a joy to be with ☺. Thank you for calling me too!
07/07/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry for being mean. I didn't mean to be too mean but just a little mean
07/07/2019, 18:52 - Bee: Hey, don't be sorry. I was caught off guard. That's all...
07/07/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yea but I can go overboard sometimes. I try to avoid it entirely but moods 😓
07/07/2019, 19:08 - Bee: I don't think you went overboard today. I'll let you know if it affects me.
07/07/2019, 19:08 - Bee: Don't overthink it
10/07/2019, 08:23 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Johnny uncle had asked me if the youth would be available to lead some songs for the Saturday special meeting in the morning. Would you be up for joining?
10/07/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Hey! No...
10/07/2019, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. No worries. I'm roping in the new youth to join instead 😋
10/07/2019, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Most of us have work or are busy Saturday morning
10/07/2019, 14:53 - Bee: Yes! And I'm not sure if I have a holiday on Saturday
10/07/2019, 14:54 - Bee: But even if I do, I'm not comfortable to join.
10/07/2019, 14:54 - Bee: You mean 'youth' 😂
10/07/2019, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yes yes. The only youth 😂. Thank you for being honest
11/07/2019, 12:05 - Bee: 😂
Nothing but. Also, weird how we thank people for honesty.
11/07/2019, 12:06 - Bee: I mean it's strange.
11/07/2019, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Na I wouldn't thank people. Well your timing for being honest just happened to coincide with things at my end is all. Helped put things in perspective for me
11/07/2019, 13:08 - Bee: Ahh. Glad I could help. 😛
12/07/2019, 20:14 - Bee: Hey. Praying for you and the family. Goodnight. :)
12/07/2019, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debs. Praising God for His comfort to all of us. Goodnight!
14/07/2019, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/miXdVbIm5BY
14/07/2019, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you soxos much for the surprise!!! I enjoyed our loud celebrations with small groups ☺
14/07/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Thank you!! You'll get your birthday wish tomorrow. Wish we could go to Marines. Next time maybe. You're precious. Goodnight! Also, is the loud comment just for me? Jk. I know it is.
14/07/2019, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Na loud isn't just for you. (you have narcissistic tendencies). I wish we could go to marines too 🙁... Hopefully next time
14/07/2019, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Though your excitement was priceless when the possibility to go came 😂
14/07/2019, 18:21 - Bee: 😂 someone had to have them because Sahil wasn't here
14/07/2019, 18:22 - Bee: 😂😂 I hope many people weren't around.
14/07/2019, 18:22 - Bee: But like I said, didn't want the night to end.
14/07/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Another time!
15/07/2019, 13:55 - Bee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NISCHAL! 
Praying Matt 6:33 (But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you) over you and me. 
Your kindness is toad-ally awesome 🐸. And I know it's corny, but you're a-maize-ing 🌽. 😛
Looking forward to seeing how God continues to use you, int his country and the next. 
Happy birthday!! :)
15/07/2019, 13:55 - Bee: In this*
15/07/2019, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby!! 😊😊. I always feel I don't deserve the care and prayers that people cover me with. But I'm glad for them all the same.

If you don't mind I'll be borrowing that line "in this country and the next" from you... That's amazingly clever 😱
15/07/2019, 15:31 - Bee: Borrow away! 😃
15/07/2019, 15:31 - Bee: Also, happy birthday.
15/07/2019, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Are you trying to compete for the most number of times a person can wish me? 😂. Cause you were winning at two
15/07/2019, 16:23 - Bee: I already won that last year. With a better record. 😛
15/07/2019, 16:24 - Bee: Not sure if you have the chats so here.
15/07/2019, 16:24 - Bee: Oh no it's the same. So I have to defeat myself.
15/07/2019, 16:24 - Bee: Happy birthday, Nischal. :D
15/07/2019, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Competition with yourself now... I guess it makes sense since no one else will be able to keep up with you
15/07/2019, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well you definitely win this year. I felt a lot more emotion from this year's wishes 😊
15/07/2019, 18:05 - Bee: 😂 I'm already planning for next year's win.
15/07/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Why?
15/07/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Why emotional?
15/07/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Lot more emotion*
15/07/2019, 18:06 - Bee: ?*
15/07/2019, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Seems like you put a lot of thought into what you wanted to say
15/07/2019, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: And I love that you did
15/07/2019, 18:28 - Bee: You're giving me more credit than I deserve. I just said what I've been wanting to say and would've  last night had Nidhi required more time to think.
15/07/2019, 18:28 - Bee: 🥺
15/07/2019, 18:50 - Bee: Last time, happy birthday! 😂
Goodnight. :)
15/07/2019, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's still 40 min to go. You could fit in quiet a few wishes in there
15/07/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be asleep so I'm not going to read any of it till tomorrow
15/07/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debs. Thank you for the conversation. I think this is the longest I've managed to keep up a chat with you 😁
16/07/2019, 05:24 - Bee: Nah the competition will be tough for me only. For next year.
16/07/2019, 05:24 - Bee: Why thank you?
16/07/2019, 05:24 - Bee: Praying for a safe journey.
17/07/2019, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo. Anything exciting happening?
18/07/2019, 03:13 - Bee: Hey!!
18/07/2019, 03:13 - Bee: No not really.
18/07/2019, 03:13 - Bee: Oh wait. Yes
18/07/2019, 03:15 - Bee: I have obstetrics this year. About pregnancy and stuff. It's amazing how a woman's body changes and prepares for childbirth. Reminds me that God really does think about the tiniest detail.
18/07/2019, 03:15 - Bee: TMI?
18/07/2019, 03:15 - Bee: How did the service go? Did it rain?
18/07/2019, 05:53 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God it did not rain during the service. It had rained in the morning so there was some concern but it stopped for the rest of the day
18/07/2019, 05:54 - Nischal Abraham: It started raining again today. The rains are much needed though since Kerala is running low on water and it wasn't raining for a long time. God's timings are perfect 😊
18/07/2019, 05:55 - Nischal Abraham: That's amazing. No it's not TMI, it's life...and the birth of a new one too. I may not know much more than 10th standard bio but that itself seems like a miracle to me
18/07/2019, 12:07 - Bee: Praise God! Was praying for no rain during the service. God answered 😃
18/07/2019, 12:10 - Bee: It is. Nothing short of a miracle. Makes me appreciate mothers on a whole another level.
18/07/2019, 12:11 - Bee: How's it going there?
18/07/2019, 12:11 - Bee: Which are you returning?
18/07/2019, 12:11 - Bee: When*
19/07/2019, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: On my way home now 😁. Didn't have proper network there so couldn't reply sooner
19/07/2019, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Just reached Mumbai at 4:30
19/07/2019, 19:04 - Bee: Ahh.. no problem 😄
19/07/2019, 19:04 - Bee: Welcome back!
21/07/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Hi
21/07/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
21/07/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: What up?
21/07/2019, 18:16 - Bee: Nothing specific.
21/07/2019, 18:16 - Bee: Hope you have a great week ahead 😃
21/07/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! 😊. You too
21/07/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Btw this Saturday are we going to meet Phillip uncle?
21/07/2019, 18:50 - Bee: Yes!
21/07/2019, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! I'll keep myself free 😁
21/07/2019, 18:54 - Bee: 😃
21/07/2019, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: How are you Debby. All okay?
21/07/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Aah I guess we're all resuming our early mornings. I'll just catch up tomorrow
21/07/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!!
22/07/2019, 09:46 - Bee: Yes yes. All okay 😃
22/07/2019, 09:47 - Bee: Thank you for asking
22/07/2019, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: Always at your service 😊
22/07/2019, 15:39 - Bee: Whhaatttt
22/07/2019, 15:40 - Bee: I'm craving some red velvet cake 😂
22/07/2019, 15:40 - Bee: Jk.
22/07/2019, 15:40 - Bee: Unless you're baking some yourself.
22/07/2019, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... I've never baked before... Let alone a red velvet cake. If you want to taste a complete beginners baking and suffer then I may just try it out 😉
22/07/2019, 17:44 - Bee: 😂 I wouldn't mind
22/07/2019, 18:02 - Bee: Again, jk.
22/07/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Doesn't sound like you're kidding 🤨
22/07/2019, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you're hinting at something...
22/07/2019, 18:05 - Bee: 😛
22/07/2019, 18:05 - Bee: I'm not.
22/07/2019, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Y'knaw what... I'm not promising anything... But I will _try_ to bake sometime soon... And if I do I'll definitely let you try some
22/07/2019, 18:13 - Bee: Ohh. You may regret telling me this because I'll keep asking you until you leave
22/07/2019, 18:14 - Bee: Also, you should make a bucket list of things you want to do here before you leave. It'll be fun
22/07/2019, 18:14 - Bee: Goodnight! :)
22/07/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: That does sound fun... I'll think on this tomorrow 😁
22/07/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!! Hope you had an amazus day ☺
23/07/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Did you?
23/07/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
23/07/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: I did think on it. Didn't do anything past thinking though
23/07/2019, 19:22 - Bee: 😂
23/07/2019, 19:22 - Bee: That's progress
24/07/2019, 02:41 - Nischal Abraham: That's what I tell myself every time I procrastinate. It's a terrible habit 😞
24/07/2019, 03:30 - Bee: Ahh. I'm not the only one then. It's become an instinct for me now
24/07/2019, 04:01 - Nischal Abraham: Whaaat... You!? No way! You're the most productive person I've seen
24/07/2019, 09:50 - Bee: I wish 🙁
24/07/2019, 09:50 - Bee: Please don't remember me by this.. it's not true!!
24/07/2019, 09:50 - Bee: I put the 'pro' in procrastination.
24/07/2019, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well at least you're a pro at it
24/07/2019, 12:00 - Bee: 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
24/07/2019, 12:33 - Bee: I've got one for you
24/07/2019, 12:33 - Bee: 😂
24/07/2019, 12:33 - Bee: You put the 'pro' in profound.
24/07/2019, 12:33 - Bee: Okay done. Bye.
24/07/2019, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Why bye? Nooooooo. Don't goooo...
24/07/2019, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take this as a compliment 😆😊
24/07/2019, 14:21 - Bee: No no. That's just for effect. 😛
24/07/2019, 14:21 - Bee: You should!! Because it is.
24/07/2019, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: So far I have one item on my "list of things to do before I have to go"
24/07/2019, 16:36 - Bee: Oh!!! May I ask what that one item is?
25/07/2019, 09:43 - Nischal Abraham: Bake a cake
25/07/2019, 15:18 - Bee: 😋
25/07/2019, 15:18 - Bee: Did you add anything else?
25/07/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I did today
* Write a song
* Make one successful Pull Request
25/07/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Explanation for the second - it's a coding thing 😅
26/07/2019, 03:21 - Bee: Thanks. I didn't know what to think of it.
26/07/2019, 03:21 - Bee: Write a song - wow.
26/07/2019, 03:21 - Bee: Have you written songs before?
26/07/2019, 03:45 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing good 😂. And nothing complete... I usually just end up with a tune and no words
26/07/2019, 13:49 - Bee: I have a feeling you're underestimating your talent.
26/07/2019, 13:50 - Bee: Can't wait to listen to the song that you'll complete before you go.
26/07/2019, 13:50 - Bee: Only if you want to share it, that is.
26/07/2019, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: I think I estimate my talent the right amount most of the time... If not overestimating it
26/07/2019, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: This just makes it sound like I have no choice but to share it otherwise I'll feel like a horrible person 😂
26/07/2019, 14:01 - Bee: 😂
26/07/2019, 14:01 - Bee: Maybe that's why I said it. 😛
26/07/2019, 14:02 - Bee: No really. You don't even have to tell me if you've completed it. I'll just assume you're leaving with a bucket list with undone items.
26/07/2019, 14:56 - Nischal Abraham: 😐
26/07/2019, 15:04 - Bee: No? Okay.
26/07/2019, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Did you reach home?
26/07/2019, 15:15 - Bee: Yes. Around 6:20...
26/07/2019, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Good 😌. I guess it wasn't raining in Thane as much
26/07/2019, 15:46 - Bee: Where have you reached?
26/07/2019, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: Just reached Thane. Looks like the rains have gone down... Or it hasn't reached Thane yet
26/07/2019, 16:02 - Bee: Oh.. I have nothing to compare it with. Let me know when you reach home
26/07/2019, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Thane is chill. I have multiple ways to reach home and even if not home there's always a place I can take shelter
26/07/2019, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Reached home
27/07/2019, 04:55 - Bee: 2 hours from the station?!
27/07/2019, 06:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yea 😞. Bad rains
27/07/2019, 08:27 - Bee: Ahh. No football today I'm guessing?
27/07/2019, 09:54 - Bee: Hey. Philip uncle's at 5:30.. he's expecting guests at 7
27/07/2019, 09:54 - Bee: We'll take a cake
27/07/2019, 10:40 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I'm in. Where do we meet
27/07/2019, 12:32 - Bee: Philip uncle's building entrance
27/07/2019, 12:32 - Bee: Do you know where he lives?
27/07/2019, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know the building
27/07/2019, 12:59 - Bee: Reenee will meet you at the entrance
30/07/2019, 19:07 - Bee: Hi
30/07/2019, 19:07 - Bee: What course are you going to Ireland for?
31/07/2019, 03:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
31/07/2019, 03:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'm going for MSc in Computer Science
31/07/2019, 12:05 - Bee: Hi
31/07/2019, 12:05 - Bee: Thanks.
31/07/2019, 12:05 - Bee: And where in Ireland?
31/07/2019, 12:06 - Bee: I realized last night that all I know about you leaving is that you're going to Ireland for your masters. Nothing else. And that's why I asked
01/08/2019, 06:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I guess I haven't really spoken in detail about it. Heading to a town called Maynooth. It's very close to Dublin
01/08/2019, 10:17 - Bee: Ahh. Cool. Will be praying.
01/08/2019, 10:19 - Bee: Maybe because I didn't ask.
01/08/2019, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Well ask away... Never had any reason to withhold information from you
01/08/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Okay
01/08/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Do you have a favorite color?
02/08/2019, 03:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yes I do
02/08/2019, 07:22 - Bee: Whats your favorite color?
02/08/2019, 07:34 - Nischal Abraham: #427045. Shades around that one
02/08/2019, 08:40 - Bee: 😶
02/08/2019, 08:40 - Bee: That's specific.
02/08/2019, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I just picked a random value that sort of matched olive green. that's the colour I use for my laptop theme 😂
02/08/2019, 08:43 - Bee: 😂
02/08/2019, 08:43 - Bee: Wow
02/08/2019, 08:43 - Bee: I didn't know colors had numbers.
02/08/2019, 08:43 - Bee: Cool.
02/08/2019, 08:44 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... I'll geek out over it some other day. If you really want to know details then ask me in person.
Short answer - that's the Red/Green/Blue value for screens
02/08/2019, 08:47 - Bee: Thanks. That's the only answer I'll understand.
02/08/2019, 08:47 - Bee: Next question. How do you feel about going to Ireland?
02/08/2019, 08:48 - Nischal Abraham: No no... I can give you a half an hour explanation and make sure you understand 🤣
02/08/2019, 08:49 - Nischal Abraham: Unprepared
02/08/2019, 09:19 - Bee: 😨
02/08/2019, 09:19 - Bee: Fine. Sunday.
02/08/2019, 09:19 - Bee: Why?
02/08/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Wow I'm surprised you agreed
02/08/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: That's a pretty complicated question...
02/08/2019, 14:17 - Bee: 😂
I'm surprised as well.
02/08/2019, 14:17 - Bee: One reason
02/08/2019, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: I know this is the next chapter that God wants to take me to. I'm still holding onto things here that I need to let go
02/08/2019, 14:41 - Bee: Oh.. do you believe you should cut all ties before leaving?
02/08/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Na... I did say it's complicated. The ties I need to break aren't with people. It's with things and a life I've become comfortable with
02/08/2019, 17:59 - Bee: You did... I wouldn't understand. But I can imagine that it's tough. Can I make it easier? How?
02/08/2019, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the concern Debs ☺. Maybe I'm just being dramatic. Keep praying for me and that's plenty
02/08/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Yep. Praying. :) Let me know if you have a specific matter you want me to pray for.
02/08/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Next question. Did you add anything else to your bucket list?
03/08/2019, 01:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nope I haven't. But now that you've asked I have a few ideas in mind
03/08/2019, 10:49 - Bee: Good!! I hope you to to complete them.
03/08/2019, 10:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
03/08/2019, 10:49 - Bee: Get to*
03/08/2019, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Why are you sorry? There's a whole section of the internet for programmer jokes
03/08/2019, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. How was your day?
03/08/2019, 19:49 - Bee: NISCHAL
03/08/2019, 20:11 - Bee: I just saw your message. I had kept the phone for charging and I forgot about it
03/08/2019, 20:12 - Bee: 😂😂😂
Immediately thought of you when I saw this
03/08/2019, 20:13 - Bee: I had college today.. I went. Because attendance. Had a hard time getting back home because of the flooding
03/08/2019, 20:13 - Bee: How was your day?
03/08/2019, 20:13 - Bee: See you tomorrow!!
03/08/2019, 20:13 - Bee: Today* 😋
04/08/2019, 02:44 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! 🙁. How did they not declare a holiday? Well I'm glad you're back home safe!
04/08/2019, 02:46 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't have work. But I did venture around Thane despite the rains. But overall it was a good day.... Because I didn't have to travel in the rain
04/08/2019, 09:16 - Bee: I don't know! I hope I get a holiday tomorrow.
04/08/2019, 09:17 - Bee: That's great! 
Traveling in the rain is fun tho.
04/08/2019, 18:23 - Bee: Hi
04/08/2019, 18:23 - Bee: Thank you for the nice time
04/08/2019, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: What's with this formality 😳
04/08/2019, 19:15 - Bee: 😶
04/08/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Thank you for the nice time, friend
04/08/2019, 19:15 - Bee: 😛
04/08/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
04/08/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you too! Shouldn't you be sleeping by now. Don't you have an early day tomorrow!?
04/08/2019, 19:19 - Bee: Hahahahahahah
04/08/2019, 19:20 - Bee: I should say that to you
04/08/2019, 19:20 - Bee: I hope your travel won't be terrible tomorrow
04/08/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Well they've put out a lot of strict warnings. I'll see how the situation is in the morning. If it's too bad I'll just work from home
04/08/2019, 19:21 - Bee: Yes that'll be better. So you have an early day anyway
04/08/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh Debby... You poor, kind soul. Work from home means I'll only start working at 12
04/08/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: If I have to travel is when I need to get up earlu
04/08/2019, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Early*
04/08/2019, 19:23 - Bee: 😂
But won't you have to wake up early to check if you get to stay home?
04/08/2019, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Well if I hear the rain when I go to snooze my alarm then I'll switch off my alarm instead 😋
04/08/2019, 19:24 - Bee: 😂
I won't keep an alarm for tomorrow. 😌
05/08/2019, 05:08 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't either. And it didn't rain...
05/08/2019, 10:30 - Bee: 😂💃🏽🥳
15/08/2019, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. Missed you in the meeting today. Hope you guys didn't sneak off on a secret trip without me when I've only got a month of time left to spare to spend with you guys...
15/08/2019, 19:25 - Bee: Hey. Don't worry, we didn't. My postings at the maternity hospital begin tomorrow and I was preparing for that...
Less than a month! Ticked anything off on your list yet?
15/08/2019, 19:29 - Bee: Off your*
15/08/2019, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing ticked off yet. But I've found direction to start some of the things on it 😊
15/08/2019, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Starting tomorrow!!! Excited?
15/08/2019, 19:41 - Bee: Gooood!
15/08/2019, 19:41 - Bee: YES. And nervous as well. But mostly excited.
16/08/2019, 04:59 - Nischal Abraham: All the best as you start your posting Debs! I'm sure God will guide you through this beautiful course. You're always in my prayer list
16/08/2019, 12:04 - Bee: Thank you so much, Nischal. :)
I've never seen so many pregnant women and newborns at once.
16/08/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha 🤣
16/08/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't think I'd read that sentence today
16/08/2019, 13:56 - Bee: 😂
22/08/2019, 04:35 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! I hope you have a great day today.
22/08/2019, 06:07 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo! Thanks Debby 😊. I had an interesting morning... And a lot of decisions to be made. And a lot of people to meet. And a lot of things to do
22/08/2019, 06:07 - Nischal Abraham: Basically there is a lot... I hope it's a great day too
22/08/2019, 06:09 - Nischal Abraham: And I pray you have a great day as well!! Hope maternity is still as exciting as before you started it
22/08/2019, 09:10 - Bee: Whooaa busy day!
22/08/2019, 09:13 - Bee: How has it been so far?
22/08/2019, 09:14 - Bee: I still find it exciting but it's not all smiles and sunshine... didn't have a great day...but I think it was needed.
22/08/2019, 10:44 - Nischal Abraham: Went out for lunch with an old school friend. He's moving away too... But it was nice catching up with him
22/08/2019, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well that's a very positive way of taking it. I think I complain too much
22/08/2019, 12:33 - Bee: That's nice 😊. Were there a lot of 'remember whens'?
22/08/2019, 12:33 - Bee: Noooooo I realized it after I had finished complaining.
22/08/2019, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yea there always is. Hopefully not my last ones
22/08/2019, 14:09 - Bee: I'm sure there'll be more. 😃
22/08/2019, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yea definitely 😁. Is it bedtime for you yet?
22/08/2019, 14:23 - Bee: Almost. 8 minutes to go
22/08/2019, 14:23 - Bee: 7 now.
22/08/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha 😂. Goodnight! I'm off to the Bible study
22/08/2019, 14:28 - Bee: 😛. Goodnight!
24/08/2019, 02:42 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2019, 05:57 - Nischal Abraham: 🤨
24/08/2019, 05:58 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you? Good morning to you too...
24/08/2019, 05:58 - Nischal Abraham: Working day?
24/08/2019, 09:17 - Bee: 🤔
24/08/2019, 09:17 - Bee: Yes
24/08/2019, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... You're the one who needs this puppy
24/08/2019, 11:30 - Bee: That's true 😭
24/08/2019, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay Debby... At least you're in maternity
24/08/2019, 12:05 - Bee: Look at you, positive outlook and all. 😃
We were allowed to leave by 3:30 🥳
24/08/2019, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! (I'm guessing that's a half day... I don't know what your normal timings are)
24/08/2019, 12:22 - Bee: Half day would be if I got to leave at 12:30... My timings are 8 to 4
24/08/2019, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Well 3:30 still sounds better than 4
24/08/2019, 12:37 - Bee: Yes, it is better. Got an empty train and bus. Woohoo!
24/08/2019, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: NIce nice... Will you be coming for the cottage meeting?
24/08/2019, 12:38 - Bee: Yes, I'll be there. You?
24/08/2019, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. These are the few free days I have. I make myself available for everything
24/08/2019, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well mostly everything...
24/08/2019, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: I try
24/08/2019, 13:37 - Bee: :) that's nice.
I'm glad you have these days completely free until you have to leave
25/08/2019, 19:32 - Bee: Hi. You now have to wait one whole year to wish me on my birthday.
25/08/2019, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I'm not in the right frame of mind to be talking right now. Don't know if I was stupid or smart in my decision.
25/08/2019, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: But it can always be a belated wish...
25/08/2019, 19:34 - Bee: I think not wishing me wouldn't be considered as smart...
25/08/2019, 19:35 - Bee: Alright
25/08/2019, 19:35 - Bee: I'll be waiting for this belated wish
25/08/2019, 19:36 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
25/08/2019, 21:22 - Bee: Hey... I was just joking earlier although my birthday would've gone better had you wished me. :)
I'm sorry to hear that you've not been in the right frame of mind to talk. I have a few things on my mind too and I would really like to pray with you and talk to you about it. Can we meet tomorrow? I would be free around 6:30 but do let me know if you have other plans and the time that would work for you.
26/08/2019, 02:39 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! Belated happy birthday!! To be fair we did sing for you(I'm just making up excuses... I'm truly terribly sorry. Regardless of whether you're joking or not)
26/08/2019, 02:41 - Nischal Abraham: I have no plans for the day. I'd love to meet up!
6:30 sounds good to me... But if you meant 6:30am I guess I'm too late in my reply
26/08/2019, 03:02 - Bee: Good morning! No don't be sorry. I'm sure you had a reason.
26/08/2019, 03:03 - Bee: You are :P. Now I'll have to wait for 6:30pm. What ya.
26/08/2019, 03:03 - Bee: I'll be come straight from the hospital. I'll let you know if I'm running late?
26/08/2019, 03:03 - Bee: Coming*
26/08/2019, 03:12 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Assume I'll take half an hour to reach meadows area. And inform me accordingly
26/08/2019, 03:13 - Bee: Got it!
26/08/2019, 03:15 - Nischal Abraham: See you then. Hope you have a wonderful day at work 😊
26/08/2019, 03:18 - Bee: I hope you have a wonderful day too. :)
26/08/2019, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Any changes in the time?
26/08/2019, 13:13 - Bee: Hey... Give me 5 extra minutes. So 6:35
26/08/2019, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: That's exact... Where are we meeting?
26/08/2019, 13:14 - Bee: Meadows.. so twisties?
26/08/2019, 13:14 - Bee: Unless you have a place in mind
26/08/2019, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Twisties sounds good... Or we can just meet at meadows and decide someplace
26/08/2019, 13:15 - Bee: Okay! See you
26/08/2019, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Okiee
26/08/2019, 14:05 - Bee: Hey
26/08/2019, 14:05 - Bee: Where are you?
26/08/2019, 14:06 - Bee: I'm walking towards twisties
26/08/2019, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: On my way. Are we just meeting at Twisties?
26/08/2019, 14:07 - Bee: Yes
26/08/2019, 14:07 - Bee: I'll be there
27/08/2019, 04:54 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! Hope you managed to sleep last night
27/08/2019, 05:51 - Bee: Good morning! I did. I'm in college today so I got and extra hour to sleep. 😌
27/08/2019, 05:51 - Bee: An*
27/08/2019, 06:22 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
27/08/2019, 06:36 - Nischal Abraham: Good to hear. Today I'm planning on finishing up my payment for my accommodation. And then start on writing a song
27/08/2019, 06:37 - Nischal Abraham: And prepare something to share for the prayer meeting today
27/08/2019, 11:05 - Bee: How is it going so far?
27/08/2019, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: The song's on hold... But I did manage to get a lot of other things done. Overall a very productive day(compared to all the other days)
27/08/2019, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: Sent thank you mails to my professors who gave me a recommendation letter
27/08/2019, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: Updated my resume
27/08/2019, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: Made a proper time table of things to be done and when to do it.
How's your day been?
27/08/2019, 12:32 - Bee: Whooaa you're on a roll!
27/08/2019, 12:35 - Bee: I have research this year...it's a group project. And we're lagging behind cause ours is an interventional study... It was a hectic day trying to finish stuff
27/08/2019, 12:38 - Bee: 17 days
27/08/2019, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Hectic days would mean it was productive too right?
27/08/2019, 12:38 - Bee: Well...
27/08/2019, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Is that how far behind you're lagging?
27/08/2019, 12:38 - Bee: Yes yes. Not as much as I was hoping though
27/08/2019, 12:39 - Bee: Nope
27/08/2019, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well my clock says 18
27/08/2019, 12:39 - Bee: I didn't count 14th
27/08/2019, 12:39 - Bee: What time is your flight?
27/08/2019, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yea that makes sense. 14th doesn't really count. I leave on a 5:30 am flight
27/08/2019, 12:40 - Bee: Ahh. So 17.
27/08/2019, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Well 17 and 11 hours
27/08/2019, 12:40 - Bee: Make the most of it!!
27/08/2019, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: What does interventional study mean?
27/08/2019, 12:43 - Bee: We're doing our research on nursing students to check the effectiveness of an active learning strategy.. so we're introducing something new which is our intervention (the activity learning strategy) to check it's effectiveness
27/08/2019, 12:45 - Nischal Abraham: That sentence made absolutely no sense to me 😂. It's alright. I'll ask more about it another time. Sounds like a cool project though
27/08/2019, 12:45 - Bee: 😂
27/08/2019, 12:46 - Bee: That would've been me if you would've told me about the RGB thing
27/08/2019, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... But can you talk about this for half an hour?
27/08/2019, 12:46 - Bee: No no no. Pls no.
27/08/2019, 12:47 - Bee: I'm going to have to time you when you tell me about RGB
27/08/2019, 12:47 - Bee: You're going on about how you can go on for half an hour
27/08/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Okay 😂. I'm already down 5 min though so it's just 25 min now
27/08/2019, 12:48 - Bee: 3 MINUTES
27/08/2019, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: Okay I'll talk for 3 minutes
27/08/2019, 12:53 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/08/2019, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Okay okay fine... I'll prepare a 27 min speech happy?
27/08/2019, 13:20 - Bee: 😂. Very
27/08/2019, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: Still on your way home?
27/08/2019, 13:24 - Bee: Yes. I'll reach in 5 minutes
27/08/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: You have very accurate travel times... That's amazing
27/08/2019, 13:39 - Bee: It's a pain if I'm running late though. Every minute is planned so everything goes haywire
27/08/2019, 13:41 - Nischal Abraham: You're so organized. You need to teach me a thing or two.... I'd be finishing stuff on my list so much faster!
27/08/2019, 14:05 - Bee: But you won't!! Because all I do is plan
27/08/2019, 14:05 - Bee: You're the one who gets stuff done
27/08/2019, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Well you've taken the first step. That's always the hardest one
27/08/2019, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: So I guess you'll be off to sleep now
27/08/2019, 14:07 - Bee: And most often the only one
27/08/2019, 14:08 - Bee: Do you have a favorite song?
27/08/2019, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: I have many favourite songs... Can't point to just one
27/08/2019, 14:09 - Bee: Tell me one
27/08/2019, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: A lot of them tend to be attached to memories... Or maybe just a feeling that I had when I heard it the first time and it reminds me of that emotion every time I hear it
27/08/2019, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: The paper kites - Bloom
27/08/2019, 14:13 - Bee: Heeyyyyyy same!
27/08/2019, 14:14 - Bee: I heard this for the first time last year when Sammy and Ruth were dropping me off at the station at the end if my trip...:(
27/08/2019, 14:15 - Bee: What's the memory attached to this?
27/08/2019, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: Comfort. Not a memory... But it's the emotion. I heard it around the time of my board exams and this really calmed me down
27/08/2019, 14:18 - Nischal Abraham: Also I love the harmonies in it!
27/08/2019, 14:18 - Nischal Abraham: And now it's associated with a sad memory of yours :(
27/08/2019, 14:30 - Bee: Yes I totally know what you're talking about!!
27/08/2019, 14:30 - Bee: Ahh...that's really nice.
27/08/2019, 14:31 - Bee: No no don't be silly
27/08/2019, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Dinner on Friday the 6th at Vijay's place. Will you be available?
27/08/2019, 18:51 - Bee: Yes. Any time after 7
27/08/2019, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Woah you're awake!
27/08/2019, 18:59 - Bee: Yes yes
27/08/2019, 19:00 - Bee: I just woke up at 11
27/08/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Well enjoy the night! I'm off to sleep
27/08/2019, 19:11 - Bee: Alright. Goodnight, Nischal. :)
28/08/2019, 06:13 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! Hope you have a wonderful day ahead.
28/08/2019, 06:13 - Bee: I hope you have a productive day! 😃
28/08/2019, 06:13 - Bee: HEYYYYYY
28/08/2019, 06:13 - Bee: 😂
28/08/2019, 06:13 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
28/08/2019, 06:13 - Bee: What a coincidence.
28/08/2019, 06:14 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I'll need to go city side today. Helping my brother out with some stuff regarding his college
28/08/2019, 06:28 - Bee: Oh... I'm in college today as well
28/08/2019, 06:35 - Nischal Abraham: Which do you prefer... College or maternity?
28/08/2019, 09:52 - Bee: I don't mind either. I have to select cases from the hospital for my evaluatory assignments which I'm missing out on. But if I'm in the hospital, the research won't go ahead. 🤷🏻‍♀
28/08/2019, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: If only there were two of you...
28/08/2019, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Well looks like I ended up wasting my whole morning and didn't go to the city. But tomorrow I'll have to travel to Panvel
28/08/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Ikr?!
28/08/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Whhyy?
28/08/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Also, Panvel around what time?
28/08/2019, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Nikhil was in Pillai's for his Masters. I need to apply for his transcripts
28/08/2019, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Whenever I'm free to go. I guess their office should be open after lunch.
28/08/2019, 11:28 - Bee: Oh. The hospital I'm posted at is two stations before Panvel but I don't know where I'll be going tomorrow
28/08/2019, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool! If you happen to be going that way let me know. We'll try and sync up... Probably coming back though cause I won't leave early in the morning
28/08/2019, 12:27 - Bee: Just found out that I will be on college tomorrow
28/08/2019, 12:27 - Bee: In*
28/08/2019, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: That's unfortunate. Where is your college?
28/08/2019, 14:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/08/2019, 14:29 - Bee: My college is in Vashi
28/08/2019, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Aww! How could anyone not smile at that. Is that Christopher on the left?
28/08/2019, 14:32 - Bee: Yes, Christopher 😃
28/08/2019, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: Cute. How come you're still awake? 😮
28/08/2019, 15:03 - Bee: Was wasting time on Netflix. Off to bed now. Bye!
28/08/2019, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. Goodnight!
29/08/2019, 03:19 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :)
29/08/2019, 03:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/08/2019, 04:28 - Nischal Abraham: Morning! Why are you sorry? Suite life was an excellent show. I miss the old days of Disney channel 😌
29/08/2019, 04:35 - Nischal Abraham: Btw... Will it be possible to meet up on Friday? There's something I need to talk to you about and I'd rather do it in person
29/08/2019, 06:52 - Bee: 😂😂 YES
29/08/2019, 06:52 - Bee: Alright...what time?
29/08/2019, 06:53 - Nischal Abraham: Whenever you're free. What time are you comfortable with?
29/08/2019, 06:59 - Bee: Is 6:30pm okay? I should be back from college by then... I'll let you know if I'm running late...half an hour in advance
29/08/2019, 07:19 - Nischal Abraham: 6:30 sounds good to me
29/08/2019, 07:20 - Nischal Abraham: Even if you're late it's fine... I'm keeping my Friday evening free
29/08/2019, 07:24 - Bee: Okay. See you tomorrow 😊
29/08/2019, 07:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. See ya tomorrow! Hope the rest of your day goes well. I just realised how hot it's become again
29/08/2019, 07:27 - Nischal Abraham: Travelling in the afternoon may not have been the best of ideas 😶
29/08/2019, 07:30 - Bee: Yours too!
29/08/2019, 07:30 - Bee: Where have you reached?
29/08/2019, 07:30 - Bee: You're right. It's so sunny!!
29/08/2019, 07:30 - Nischal Abraham: Airoli. Just got into a Vashi train
29/08/2019, 07:31 - Nischal Abraham: The frequency of this line is terrible 😂. I'm so used to travelling in central
29/08/2019, 07:31 - Bee: Hahaha yes. I'm always too early for college or too late
29/08/2019, 07:32 - Bee: But it's never as crowded as the central line
29/08/2019, 07:33 - Nischal Abraham: I just assumed it's empty cause no one travels in the afternoon. But I'm sure you're right. Central rush can be mad sometimes
29/08/2019, 11:05 - Bee: That's there too. But it's not as crowded as central in the evenings either
29/08/2019, 11:05 - Bee: Have you collected the transcripts? On your way back?
29/08/2019, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Already reached home. I finished up pretty quickly so I thought I'd come home for lunch
29/08/2019, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: But Panvel is a lot further away then I imagined... Just reached 5 min back
29/08/2019, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: Home
29/08/2019, 12:27 - Bee: That was quick!!
29/08/2019, 12:27 - Bee: Yeah.. an hour from Thane
29/08/2019, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I didn't get the transcripts. Issues with the documents I needed to take. So I only spent 10 min in the college
29/08/2019, 12:46 - Bee: That's good. Because the trans harbor line is delayed
29/08/2019, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Still on your way back?
29/08/2019, 13:21 - Bee: Yes. I should reach in half an hour
29/08/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight. Still in for tomorrow 6:30ish?
29/08/2019, 18:51 - Bee: Yes.
29/08/2019, 18:52 - Bee: I hope it's not a sleepless night for me tonight.
29/08/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Or you.
29/08/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
29/08/2019, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Why would it be sleepless for you?
29/08/2019, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Unless you've got work to do. Then all the best 😁
29/08/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Because I don't know what you're gonna say?
29/08/2019, 18:54 - Bee: Nah I'll probably try and go to sleep
29/08/2019, 18:54 - Bee: Right back at you
29/08/2019, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: How about for tonight leave the worrying part to me. You already had one sleepless night
29/08/2019, 18:56 - Bee: I shall try.
29/08/2019, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: That'd be awesome. Don't worry I'll be sleeping too. Have an early start sorting things out for Nikhil
29/08/2019, 18:57 - Bee: Knowing that makes me feel better.
29/08/2019, 18:57 - Bee: I hope you have a peaceful night.
29/08/2019, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! You too... Please sleep otherwise I'll feel bad 🙁
29/08/2019, 18:59 - Bee: I will I will.
29/08/2019, 18:59 - Bee: You sleep too.
29/08/2019, 18:59 - Bee: Bye!
29/08/2019, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I will definitely be sleeping
30/08/2019, 01:51 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo! Good morning. Slept well?
30/08/2019, 02:48 - Bee: Hey! I did. You?
30/08/2019, 03:20 - Nischal Abraham: I did too
30/08/2019, 03:22 - Nischal Abraham: Better than I thought I would
30/08/2019, 03:40 - Bee: Same!! I usually wake up once or twice but I slept through last night
30/08/2019, 03:45 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear it ☺. Enjoy your day! Maternity or college?
30/08/2019, 04:06 - Bee: I'm in college today
30/08/2019, 04:06 - Bee: Are you going to Panvel again?
30/08/2019, 04:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Already in Panvel actually. Came with my dad
30/08/2019, 04:18 - Nischal Abraham: Depending on how things go I may be going to city as well before lunch. Quiet a lot of travelling today
30/08/2019, 08:28 - Bee: Hey
30/08/2019, 08:29 - Bee: We just finished our research proposal presentation today.
30/08/2019, 08:29 - Bee: That's early!
30/08/2019, 08:29 - Bee: Done with the work in Panvel?
30/08/2019, 08:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'm at CST now. Looking for a place to eat :P
30/08/2019, 08:38 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! How was it?
30/08/2019, 09:23 - Bee: It went well :D the principal was impressed. It was shocking
30/08/2019, 09:23 - Bee: Found a place yet? Go to Bagdadi. :P
30/08/2019, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Ah I just settled for Burger King since the office was opening at 2
30/08/2019, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Done with what needed to be done. Hopefully I'll reach home by 5
30/08/2019, 10:21 - Nischal Abraham: Shocking because the principal was impressed? 😂
30/08/2019, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. My battery is running low. I need it to last at least till Thane so that I can show the ticket on my phone. 
I'm still on time for meeting today. If anything changes at your end just message I'll read it later
30/08/2019, 12:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy I'm home. Battery is no longer an issue
30/08/2019, 12:53 - Bee: Hey
30/08/2019, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yea?
30/08/2019, 12:56 - Bee: I think I'll be late
30/08/2019, 12:56 - Bee: I haven't left college yet
30/08/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I haven't left home either
30/08/2019, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're leaving college
30/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Hi
30/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: I just left from college
30/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Where are we meeting?
30/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: I should reach Meadows at 7
30/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Yes 😂
30/08/2019, 13:21 - Nischal Abraham: You sure you're up for it? If you're tired we can just meet up another day
30/08/2019, 13:22 - Bee: No no. I'm alright
30/08/2019, 13:22 - Bee: :)
30/08/2019, 13:22 - Bee: Not too tired.
30/08/2019, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Well I'm not hungry today so how about we just meet up and take a walk or something 😅
30/08/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: Or we could go to a park... I'll meet you at meadows circle and we'll decide from there?
30/08/2019, 13:34 - Bee: Sounds good 😃
I'll see you at Meadows
30/08/2019, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be there at 7
30/08/2019, 13:38 - Bee: Looking forward to 7.
30/08/2019, 17:03 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Commitment by Sanctus Real
https://open.spotify.com/track/0kJSz8ENF9QUcBmhBvIROi?si=2LLAVHAgS6S33jKkF-dC5A
30/08/2019, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: I'll give it a listen
30/08/2019, 17:11 - Bee: Alright
30/08/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: You know... When I was preparing to share with you today... I was certain I'd completely break down
30/08/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: Cause every time I thought about it I'd be worried... But idk why, I felt calmed
30/08/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Like not because I was trying to be calm cause that clearly wasn't working for me... Anyway I've got a lot to pray about. Thank you for listening
30/08/2019, 17:22 - Bee: I can imagine how hard it must've been for you to share this with me.
30/08/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Thank you for sharing.
30/08/2019, 17:23 - Bee: I stand by what I said. But I'm gonna take some time to think. And a lot more time to pray.
30/08/2019, 17:23 - Bee: :)
30/08/2019, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing would delight me more! 
Well I'm off to dinner
30/08/2019, 18:26 - Bee: Hey
30/08/2019, 18:29 - Bee: I'm unable to keep my eyes open
30/08/2019, 18:29 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
31/08/2019, 03:57 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! I slept too well... I don't have to be anywhere but I just got up
31/08/2019, 08:48 - Bee: Hey
31/08/2019, 08:48 - Bee: How come no football today?
31/08/2019, 08:48 - Bee: Sorry for such a late reply...
31/08/2019, 08:48 - Bee: I've been busy with this research thing
31/08/2019, 08:53 - Bee: We were supposed to be left early. Not so sure anymore. 🙁
31/08/2019, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Not enough people today. So it got cancelled
31/08/2019, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be sorry for that! I know you're in college 😅. I feel bad I'm just lazing around at home anyway
31/08/2019, 09:28 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. Well I hope you're finding the fun in your research
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: Whaaatt because it's raining,m
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: ,mz
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: ?*
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: I've realized that rain is such a big deal for me
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: You're on holiday
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: Any item crossed from your list?
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Bee: Well...
31/08/2019, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... no no. Not because of the rains. Rolf sprained his ankle, Arun had to be somewhere else, and no one else said anything so it got cancelled
31/08/2019, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: Just one of those days
31/08/2019, 09:59 - Nischal Abraham: Just now?
31/08/2019, 09:59 - Bee: This morning
31/08/2019, 10:02 - Nischal Abraham: I think its adorable you love the rains
31/08/2019, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: I've got multiple lists now... But I haven't crossed anything off from my main list still :(
31/08/2019, 10:06 - Bee: ☺☺🥰
31/08/2019, 10:08 - Bee: Anything I can help you with?
31/08/2019, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for offering! But it's all stuff I need to do before I go. And not a lot of it is really completely achievable... Just gonna do the best I can :)
31/08/2019, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Also don't you already have a lot on your hands to be done anyway?
31/08/2019, 10:21 - Bee: Nischal
31/08/2019, 10:21 - Bee: I'll always have something to do
31/08/2019, 10:22 - Bee: But you're here for 13 days
31/08/2019, 10:22 - Bee: Alright. Tell me when you've completed anything...or nothing
31/08/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: I hope it's not nothing. There are some things on the list that absolutely HAVE to happen. 
I'm actually doing quite well on my other lists. My buy list is almost complete. Need to start on my packing list now
31/08/2019, 10:39 - Bee: Well done, Nischal!!
31/08/2019, 10:39 - Bee: 🥳😛
31/08/2019, 10:39 - Bee: Like what?
31/08/2019, 10:39 - Bee: Also, what's up?
31/08/2019, 10:50 - Nischal Abraham: Eating lunch now. I'll read out my list to you soon... And if there's anything that I need help with you'll be the first person I call
31/08/2019, 12:25 - Bee: Okay!
31/08/2019, 12:25 - Bee: I don't know how to bake though
31/08/2019, 12:26 - Bee: Coding isn't my thing
31/08/2019, 12:26 - Bee: Did you mention this in your list? I don't remember seeing it
31/08/2019, 12:26 - Bee: A pull request
31/08/2019, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh!! I forgot to add that to the list. Yea need to contribute to open source once
31/08/2019, 12:32 - Bee: What?! 😶
31/08/2019, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
31/08/2019, 12:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's a coding thing. Don't worry I won't ask you to help out with things you aren't familiar with
31/08/2019, 12:33 - Bee: 😂
31/08/2019, 12:33 - Bee: I think that would be most things on your list
31/08/2019, 12:34 - Nischal Abraham: Which is why I said it's thing "I" need to get done before I go
31/08/2019, 12:35 - Bee: Fiiiiiinnnnnee Nischal
31/08/2019, 12:35 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/08/2019, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take you up on your offer when I have something that requires more help
31/08/2019, 12:35 - Bee: Alright
31/08/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
31/08/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: Where do you find these memes?
31/08/2019, 12:37 - Bee: Pinterest 😎
31/08/2019, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. So what's the verdict? Left early from college or na?
31/08/2019, 12:47 - Bee: Nope. I left at 5
31/08/2019, 12:48 - Bee: I wanted to finish a few things before going to Reenee's but I don't think I'll get the time to
31/08/2019, 12:49 - Nischal Abraham: Finish a few things in college or at home? I think you'll still have some time left over even now
31/08/2019, 12:52 - Bee: At home
31/08/2019, 12:53 - Bee: What time will you reach?
31/08/2019, 12:53 - Bee: Reenee's
31/08/2019, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: I was invited to reach by 7:30 so that's when I'll be there
31/08/2019, 12:53 - Bee: Ahh. Same. I'll be there by then
31/08/2019, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: And you'll get time to finish up whatever you wanted to?
31/08/2019, 12:57 - Bee: No. Not enough time
31/08/2019, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Well I'll see you at Reenee's!
31/08/2019, 13:00 - Bee: Yep. :)
31/08/2019, 13:00 - Bee: Do you like to cook.
31/08/2019, 13:00 - Bee: ?*
31/08/2019, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't had a lot of experience with it to say that I like it or not. I've never disliked cooking if that makes any sense :P
31/08/2019, 13:01 - Bee: I'll ask you again in a year
31/08/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'll probably have a more definitive answer then
31/08/2019, 13:11 - Bee: I like to cook but I don't know how to
31/08/2019, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you like it then there's always motivation to learn
31/08/2019, 13:12 - Bee: I procrastinate, remember
31/08/2019, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: And from my experience(which is extremely limited btw) cooking is something you learn only by doing
31/08/2019, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: You and me both 😂
31/08/2019, 13:13 - Bee: I'm pretty sure I'm worse
31/08/2019, 13:13 - Bee: Why so profound
31/08/2019, 13:14 - Bee: Now I have no one to blame but myself for not knowing how to cook
31/08/2019, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: But life will bring up a situation where it'll be easier to cook than not to. I think I'm getting there pretty soon... Someday you will too!
31/08/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Like the final day before an assignment submission... When you'll have no choice but to cook... I know that's the only way I'm going to start cooking
31/08/2019, 13:16 - Bee: Thank you
31/08/2019, 13:16 - Bee: That's how I learnt most things anyway
31/08/2019, 13:17 - Bee: What was the best compliment you've received?
31/08/2019, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: I used to be more motivated to do things I like... But recently I'm finding it very hard to like things as much as I used to
31/08/2019, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: My teachers writing I have a lot of potential but am too lazy in my report card? 🤣
31/08/2019, 13:18 - Bee: I remember being like that too. In my early teens
31/08/2019, 13:18 - Bee: 😂
31/08/2019, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure I've received a more meaningful compliment. Give me some time to think and I'll get back to you on it
31/08/2019, 13:18 - Bee: I'm sure that falls under the top 5 but is it the best?
31/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Take your time
31/08/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Be careful when you say that. I'm still taking my time with Merin's questions she asked a month back
31/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: I mean not one day or anything like you took to wish me but yes take your time. 😛.
31/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Oh no I haven't replied either.
31/08/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Thank you for the reminder.
31/08/2019, 13:20 - Bee: Last time
31/08/2019, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... You're welcome!
31/08/2019, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: We'll see about that...
31/08/2019, 13:22 - Bee: 😂
31/08/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: So Debby... It really was supposed to be dinner with just Nidhi and me
31/08/2019, 14:38 - Bee: 😶
31/08/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: I wasn't really clear on the details. I think Reenee's freaking out a wee slight bit that Rolf didn't convey the message properly
31/08/2019, 14:40 - Bee: Oh
31/08/2019, 14:40 - Bee: Cool
31/08/2019, 14:40 - Bee: I'll cancel then
31/08/2019, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry about that. I thought it was open invitation 😶
31/08/2019, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: Should've asked more clearly
31/08/2019, 14:59 - Bee: I was about to text Reenee.. good you texted before that
31/08/2019, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yea now the embarrassment stops with me
31/08/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry you had to cancel tho... Well now you can do the thing you wanted to do when you were home! Right?
31/08/2019, 15:05 - Bee: 😂
31/08/2019, 15:05 - Bee: Yes yes
31/08/2019, 15:05 - Bee: All thanks to you
31/08/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
31/08/2019, 15:08 - Bee: 😂
31/08/2019, 15:09 - Bee: Nobody else knows
01/09/2019, 09:38 - Bee: Hey. I don't know if you've read the notes from last night. I haven't added mine. I'll give it to you later...just before you leave
01/09/2019, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't read the other notes yet. I don't mind waiting for yours :). You may take your time with it
01/09/2019, 11:18 - Bee: Okay. :)
01/09/2019, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: That I'm a good friend
01/09/2019, 16:18 - Bee: Oh
01/09/2019, 16:18 - Bee: You are a good friend.
01/09/2019, 16:18 - Bee: You can write it down
01/09/2019, 16:18 - Bee: I'm case you're like me... forgetful
01/09/2019, 16:19 - Bee: In*
01/09/2019, 16:23 - Bee: Also, I've taken all the time that I'll need.
01/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you!
01/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: I discovered a YouTube singer... Who has an amazing voice... But all his songs sound so sad. And its putting me in such a mood 😭
01/09/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: And today was such a blessing!! I'm sorry for the late reply, but we had a family dinner followed by a fairly long discussion on biblical principles in different churches
01/09/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: I should start taking my time
02/09/2019, 02:36 - Bee: What's his name?
02/09/2019, 02:37 - Bee: No don't be sorry. How was it a blessing? I'm not doubting what you're saying is just like to know more
02/09/2019, 02:37 - Bee: I'd*
02/09/2019, 02:37 - Bee: Okay. I'll wait.
02/09/2019, 02:38 - Bee: Reenee and I plan on spending some time with Joyce and the kids in the morning. I'm very excited. ☺
02/09/2019, 02:39 - Bee: Are you going for the reception on the evening?
02/09/2019, 04:54 - Nischal Abraham: Who's reception is it? I don't think I know the people
02/09/2019, 04:55 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/knPi-RZP74Q
02/09/2019, 04:59 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't suspect you of doubting it till you said it 🤨.
I felt so connected during worship. I just hope and pray God will use the gospel to touch people. And just the family talks in the evening... Some of it was about finding an assembly, and some on building a new family and what it's meant to look like.
I'm just glad for these talks with my parents. And I'm not even the one initiating it yet
02/09/2019, 04:59 - Bee: This guy from Sharon
02/09/2019, 05:18 - Bee: 😂. Oops.
That's so good! Maybe they want to have a closer relationship with you as well
02/09/2019, 05:19 - Bee: Yes...I'm praying for all those who heard the gospel too. I saw an aunty in white approach you after the meeting.. was she interested in the gospel?
02/09/2019, 05:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Her niece is admitted in the hospital with cancer. She was here last week as well
02/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: Oh. She did look familiar
02/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/09/2019, 07:24 - Nischal Abraham: Who's that sleeping on the couch?
02/09/2019, 07:41 - Bee: Jason
02/09/2019, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha he looks bored 😂. Where's the tiny one?
02/09/2019, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: You guys looked like you had fun ☺
02/09/2019, 07:45 - Bee: 😂. He's been keeping Kitto busy with deep talks.
02/09/2019, 07:45 - Bee: She's running around
02/09/2019, 07:45 - Bee: Yes we're still here
02/09/2019, 07:45 - Nischal Abraham: Aww cool! Be in the moment Debby and stop chatting online 😂
02/09/2019, 09:17 - Bee: 😂
02/09/2019, 09:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/09/2019, 09:19 - Bee: Cartoons
02/09/2019, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
02/09/2019, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: He's trying so hard
02/09/2019, 10:31 - Bee: 😂
02/09/2019, 10:31 - Bee: He's an adorable big brother
02/09/2019, 10:32 - Bee: Always offering cuddles and kisses
02/09/2019, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: It's a lot more than I do for Nidhi
02/09/2019, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun at the reception!
02/09/2019, 14:34 - Bee: You brothers must learn. 😛
02/09/2019, 14:34 - Bee: I don't know if it'll be fun. I'm going to give Reenee company
02/09/2019, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: We brothers know enough! But we choose to act otherwise
02/09/2019, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Well you're get wedding food though
02/09/2019, 15:11 - Bee: But whhyyy?!
02/09/2019, 15:11 - Bee: That's the second and the last reason why I'm here. :P
02/09/2019, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: Cause we don't need to outwardly express that we care for our siblings. That's reserved for babies 😁
02/09/2019, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe you could find another fun wedding to crash ;)
02/09/2019, 15:28 - Bee: It'll be nice to let then know once in a while though
02/09/2019, 15:28 - Bee: Them*
02/09/2019, 15:28 - Bee: Noooooo how can we do that without you?!
02/09/2019, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Just share the experience with me later is good enough. I'll enjoy it through your narration
02/09/2019, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Completely agree... I do let her know once in a while
02/09/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Too bad there weren't any other weddings around
02/09/2019, 17:51 - Bee: Are you on Pinterest?
02/09/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I was... Then I had to quit
02/09/2019, 17:53 - Bee: Had to? Why?
02/09/2019, 17:54 - Bee: If you don't mind me asking.
02/09/2019, 17:54 - Bee: But I already asked.
02/09/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: I have no self control 😞
02/09/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: So I force control... By deleting apps that take up too much of my time
02/09/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: It usually happens during a phase when I need to be super productive but I'm not unless I take some drastic measures
02/09/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Why do you ask?
02/09/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: If you don't mind me asking.
02/09/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: But I already asked.
02/09/2019, 18:03 - Bee: So you reinstall them after you've finished the task you had to?
02/09/2019, 18:03 - Bee: I thought I could send pins that I like.. nothing important. I can send them here as well
02/09/2019, 18:03 - Bee: 😛
02/09/2019, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm too lazy to do that 😅. But I can install it if you want me to... Thing is I didn't really have much use for Pinterest... And I would just spend time surfing random pins in recommended
02/09/2019, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: So now you tell me... Do you want me to install Pinterest again?
02/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Oh no no it's okay
02/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Another reason why I asked is because I wanted to look you up if you were there
02/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: If I want you to I'll tell you
02/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Later probably
02/09/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: All my boards were private. I think I had one public board and that was for desks... Because I was getting my room redone 😂
02/09/2019, 18:08 - Bee: Noooo
02/09/2019, 18:09 - Bee: Have you looked your crushes up on social media?
02/09/2019, 18:10 - Bee: I'm trying to do that. But you're not on anything.
02/09/2019, 18:10 - Bee: 😂.
02/09/2019, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
02/09/2019, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Aren't you supposed to do that BEFORE the crush knows?
02/09/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Hahaha yes. I did it before as well. Didn't help at all.
02/09/2019, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'm on twitter @unknwnlistener
02/09/2019, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: But yea... Not very socially influencing there either 😶. But y'know... If there's something about me you wanna know... All you gotta do is ask
02/09/2019, 18:14 - Bee: I'm not on Twitter. 🤦🏻‍♀ I'll look for a way.
02/09/2019, 18:15 - Bee: Yes I know. But it's a different feeling to look a crush up online. One that I can live with 🤷🏻‍♀
02/09/2019, 18:15 - Bee: Without*
02/09/2019, 18:15 - Bee: Oops.
02/09/2019, 18:15 - Bee: Right back at you.
02/09/2019, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... Is it weird I've never looked up crushes on social media?
02/09/2019, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it's cause I'm not on social media...
02/09/2019, 18:16 - Bee: IT IS. You missed out on a lot. 😂
02/09/2019, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: OH! That makes so much sense when I said it 😮
02/09/2019, 18:17 - Bee: This?
02/09/2019, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yea 😂
02/09/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Yes I think it makes sense
02/09/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Might be the reason why I'm asking about your social media handles
02/09/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Now I wish I did have some social media stuff
02/09/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: How was the reception btw?
02/09/2019, 18:20 - Bee: It was alright. Uneventful. I got to play with kids and eat good food so there's that
02/09/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: You abandoned Reenee for kids!?
02/09/2019, 18:22 - Bee: For a while yes. Who can say no to kids?!
02/09/2019, 18:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Awwww
02/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: They so adorable!!!
02/09/2019, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Okay you're excused for this
02/09/2019, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have college tomorrow?
02/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Ikr??!!
02/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Yes. Back to the grind
02/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Do you have plans?
02/09/2019, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Not really... Bank visit in the morning and prayer meeting in the evening are the only things planned
02/09/2019, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Honestly... I should just make plans now. There is stuff to be done. Thanks Debby!
02/09/2019, 18:32 - Bee: I didn't do anything?
02/09/2019, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: You helped me realise that I need plans for tomorrow
02/09/2019, 18:32 - Bee: Oh. Is there anyone you've been wanting to visit?
02/09/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Have you started packing?
02/09/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Not that I know of
02/09/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
02/09/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Okay
02/09/2019, 18:33 - Bee: When do you plan on starting?
02/09/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Tomorrow?
02/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: 😂
02/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: Really?
02/09/2019, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Sure... Better than day after right?
02/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: Much better. I'll ask you tomorrow night m
02/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: *.
02/09/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... I'll prepare for it. Is it past your bedtime yet?
02/09/2019, 18:37 - Bee: It is. I should go to sleep. I need to wake up early tomorrow. I need to read a chapter before I leave for college
02/09/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Then sleep. And stop trying to stalk me on social media!
02/09/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight 😌
02/09/2019, 18:39 - Bee: I didn't spend much time doing that though. You're not on anything!!
02/09/2019, 18:39 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
02/09/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: You're welcome for saving you the time and trouble 😂😂
02/09/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Hahaha. But now I don't know your political views. Or the filters you like to use. Or the restaurants you've been to. Or who you click the most photos with. I don't know anything!!
02/09/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure we'll figure it out. Cause I don't really know either
02/09/2019, 18:42 - Bee: I like that you said 'we'. Okay bye. Goodnight.
02/09/2019, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Daybee!
03/09/2019, 02:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! I hope you find joy in something you do today ☺
03/09/2019, 02:42 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!! I hope you find joy too. And that you get done stuff done. And by stuff I mean packing.
03/09/2019, 02:44 - Bee: Get stuff done. 🤦🏻‍♀
03/09/2019, 03:05 - Nischal Abraham: I will most definitely _try_ to get stuff done
03/09/2019, 07:21 - Bee: How's your day been so far?
03/09/2019, 07:21 - Bee: What did you read in your quiet time?
03/09/2019, 08:23 - Nischal Abraham: I was looking for Judges 4,5. Which led me to the last few chapters of Judges
03/09/2019, 08:24 - Nischal Abraham: And reminded me of old questions I've had about that section. Always a confusing incident every time I read it. And the most graphic scene I've ever read in my life
03/09/2019, 08:29 - Nischal Abraham: How about you?
03/09/2019, 09:41 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to Panvel now. Give me a call whenever you're free after reading this
03/09/2019, 09:49 - Bee: Hey. We've been left early. My friend is giving me a ride up to Majiwada. Shall I call you once I reach home? I should reach around 3
03/09/2019, 09:50 - Bee: I read through the book of Haggai because the Sunday's sermon has been on my mind
03/09/2019, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool! Looks like the holidays do still make a difference. No need to call then... I was just thinking if we're returning at the same time we could meet
03/09/2019, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. I'm often guilty of not following up on messages that I've noted down
03/09/2019, 10:04 - Bee: Oh noooooo
03/09/2019, 10:04 - Bee: I'll see you at the prayer meeting?
03/09/2019, 10:05 - Bee: Same. So I started writing notes in the Bible itself. Otherwise I never go through previous messages...
03/09/2019, 10:07 - Bee: Also, schools are closed for the whole week!! 😭
03/09/2019, 10:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'll be there
03/09/2019, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well you aren't in school anymore 😋
03/09/2019, 10:54 - Bee: 😭
03/09/2019, 11:04 - Bee: Just googled and found out that the northern lights are visible from Ireland!!!!
03/09/2019, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice... Right now my mind is focused on the rain storm in front of me :(
03/09/2019, 11:30 - Bee: How bad is it?
03/09/2019, 11:30 - Bee: Was the train on time?
03/09/2019, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: Got onto a 4:14 Thane at Panvel. It's gone down now. I guess God just wanted me to hurry up with my walking to and from the college 😅
03/09/2019, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: And that is AWESOME! I can't even begin to imagine what it looks like person... Just hope it's visible around Dublin
03/09/2019, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: in person*
03/09/2019, 12:52 - Bee: 😂. He's trying to get you to like rains
03/09/2019, 12:52 - Bee: YES!! I've been a fan of the northern lights ever since I studied about it in school. I wish to can see them in person one day
03/09/2019, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: I like the rains... I just don't like travelling in them. Especially with a bag full of important documents
03/09/2019, 14:32 - Bee: Oh I didn't think of that.
03/09/2019, 14:33 - Bee: I thought Pillais will take another 2 weeks?
03/09/2019, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Well there was a really sweet guy who got it done really quickly for us. Xavier's on the other hand will take 2 more weeks
03/09/2019, 18:28 - Bee: That's good! So only one college remaining
03/09/2019, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm not involved in that one anymore... It's beyond my time
03/09/2019, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Mom will go and collect it whenever it's ready
03/09/2019, 18:30 - Bee: At least you could help with one.
03/09/2019, 18:30 - Bee: I don't feel like going to college tomorrow. It's so cozy. Rain and all
03/09/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/3Ba_WoSZXvw
03/09/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: It is incredibly cozy!! Such a sleeping in weather 😊
03/09/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hospital or College tomorrow?
03/09/2019, 18:32 - Bee: College tomorrow
03/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: Wow
03/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: How do people sing like that
03/09/2019, 18:34 - Bee: Like how??!?!!
03/09/2019, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: I mean the responsible thing to do would be to go... But rains
03/09/2019, 18:35 - Bee: So soothing
03/09/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I asked that same question 4 years back
03/09/2019, 18:35 - Bee: I will be going.. There's research stuff to be done
03/09/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: OH! YouTube is kind of a social media right!? I spend all my time on there
03/09/2019, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Who knows maybe the rains will die down by the morning
03/09/2019, 18:38 - Bee: I don't know. Do you have playlists?
03/09/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: I have a few... Mostly for songs I want to relisten to
03/09/2019, 18:39 - Bee: Cool. I'll go stalk. :P
03/09/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... Or I could just share?
03/09/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: If you are going tomorrow... Shouldn't you be sleeping...
03/09/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Oh yes. That'll be easier.
03/09/2019, 18:40 - Bee: I should...but the weather is too good to be missed.
03/09/2019, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Do you sit at a window and stare out at the rain?
03/09/2019, 18:42 - Bee: I'll go sleep by 11:30
03/09/2019, 18:42 - Bee: I do. 😶
03/09/2019, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: You can sleep whenever you want to... Don't let me guilt trip you 😅
03/09/2019, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice 😌
03/09/2019, 18:43 - Bee: Too late. But I probably need it.
03/09/2019, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Well maybe for next time then. I mean I don't want you to be staying up cause I'm up cause I have nowhere to be but you kinda do
03/09/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: But if you're up anyway then I'm up too 😁
03/09/2019, 18:46 - Bee: I think I'll be up for a while.
03/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: I'll tell you when it's impossible for me to keep my eyes open
03/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: Do you have any pet peeves,?
03/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: ?*
03/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: Random, I know.
03/09/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: I noticed one recently... When people don't follow traffic rules
03/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: Oh
03/09/2019, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Driving is stressful 🤣
03/09/2019, 18:48 - Bee: Are you the kind who loses cool? Or you just shake your head and get over it
03/09/2019, 18:48 - Bee: IKR?! That's why I don't drive. :P
03/09/2019, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely the latter. I've never lost my cool even when bikes have hit the car and gone
03/09/2019, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: That's no reason not to do something. Nursing is stressful and yet it's something you want to do
03/09/2019, 18:50 - Bee: That's impressive. How a person reacts while driving speaks a lot
03/09/2019, 18:51 - Bee: Yes but while driving I have no control on what's going on around me
03/09/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's my non confrontational self that'd rather stay away from any conflict
03/09/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: And its not always a good thing because some situations require a strong response
03/09/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: But for now I live with what I've got.
03/09/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: What's one of your biggest fears?
03/09/2019, 18:54 - Bee: The fear of being replaced
03/09/2019, 18:55 - Bee: I've learnt that too. I'm quiet when I need to be assertive
03/09/2019, 18:55 - Bee: Yours?
03/09/2019, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: The fear of messing up
03/09/2019, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: I really only noticed it after my team lead at work pointed it out about the work I do... And when I thought about it it's applicable for everything I've done
03/09/2019, 19:01 - Bee: So what do you do? Do you abandon the task at hand?
03/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: No I play it safe... Always
03/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: And safe doesn't always mean good... It just means I'm trying to keep myself out of trouble
03/09/2019, 19:10 - Bee: God really did bless you with a good team :)
03/09/2019, 19:10 - Bee: Spiritually also?
03/09/2019, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: God blessed me all the way
03/09/2019, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: I did try... Or my inclination is to anyway
03/09/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: But God pushes me past my fears for His glory
03/09/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Story of our lives. It's funny sometimes how God works
03/09/2019, 19:16 - Bee: I was thinking and laughing to myself about how Introverted I am yet God uses me to invite patients every Sunday... In any other setting and for any other reason I know I wouldn't be able to do it
03/09/2019, 19:17 - Bee: I feel like Balaams donkey!
03/09/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh well put! That's exactly how I feel. I feel if it wasn't what we were weakest in then we'd look at it as us doing something in our own ability
03/09/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: But now when things work out I can only glorify God through it cause I know there's no way I'd be able to work things out in my own strength
03/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: YES.
03/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: <Media omitted>
03/09/2019, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Amen! I may have been wrong about the rain dying down by the morning
03/09/2019, 19:35 - Bee: Yep. Maybe I won't have college tomorrow? 😋
03/09/2019, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: It isn't raining that heavily. Well I know I don't have anything to do tomorrow but my eyes are shutting
03/09/2019, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like you are better are staying up😅
03/09/2019, 19:37 - Bee: Looks like I am!
03/09/2019, 19:38 - Bee: Sleep tight. :)
03/09/2019, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Never really understood that phrase
03/09/2019, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight to you too! ^_^
03/09/2019, 19:39 - Bee: It refers to how the sheet or blanket is tucked all under.. so it's tight. Maybe. Bye.
03/09/2019, 19:39 - Bee: I think I should go sleep too.
03/09/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: If you plan on going to college then you probably should :P
03/09/2019, 19:40 - Bee: Yes. I will go to college. And I will go to sleep now.
03/09/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Makes sense to me. Bye bee
04/09/2019, 03:24 - Bee: Heeeyyyy.
04/09/2019, 04:39 - Nischal Abraham: Hieeeee
04/09/2019, 04:39 - Nischal Abraham: How's college?
04/09/2019, 04:43 - Nischal Abraham: Also it would seem I properly slept in today. Looks like I was tired from travel
04/09/2019, 06:16 - Bee: I'm glad I came
04/09/2019, 06:17 - Bee: I can finish a lot of research because only my group is here in college.
04/09/2019, 06:31 - Bee: But they might let us leave early
04/09/2019, 06:31 - Bee: Because rains.
04/09/2019, 06:31 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
04/09/2019, 06:32 - Bee: Did you?
04/09/2019, 06:52 - Nischal Abraham: All things work together for good 😁. It's a win-win for you if you manage to come back early as well
04/09/2019, 06:52 - Nischal Abraham: Boy did I. Finished 3 things on my list... 3 things I was putting off for a long time
04/09/2019, 07:05 - Bee: Woohooo! 😃
04/09/2019, 07:05 - Bee: Well done, Nischal. :P
04/09/2019, 07:06 - Bee: Yes. I'm really glad I came. :)
04/09/2019, 07:06 - Nischal Abraham: Today I've got another headache to complete
04/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: What is it?
04/09/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh this is interesting. So I made a reply on my laptop... But before I could send the electricity went out
04/09/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: And with no electricity my WiFi doesn't work
04/09/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: I switched my number from Postpaid to prepaid... And just managed to get it up and running today
04/09/2019, 07:36 - Nischal Abraham: But my Amazon Prime subscription got cancelled... And I've already paid for this year. So now I'm trying to get that resolved
04/09/2019, 07:37 - Bee: You can use your cellphone hotspot right?
04/09/2019, 07:37 - Bee: You must've already thought of that.
04/09/2019, 07:38 - Nischal Abraham: I could. But it was easier to just send another message from my phone than to connect my laptop to my phone just to send a whatsapp message. So if you get another message later today telling you the exact same thing I already told you... Well you know
04/09/2019, 07:39 - Nischal Abraham: So when do you find out if you're let out early. I had a nice walk in the rain once today already
04/09/2019, 08:15 - Bee: Oh this is about WhatsApp.
04/09/2019, 08:16 - Bee: I thought you're trying to solve the Prime issue and then this happened.
04/09/2019, 08:16 - Bee: I'll leave from here in 10 minutes
04/09/2019, 08:18 - Bee: Has Nidhi gone to college?
04/09/2019, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's nice!
04/09/2019, 08:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi did go to college. I didn't hear anything about her coming back home early though
04/09/2019, 08:22 - Bee: Ahh...I've been calling but she's not picking up. She must be busy
04/09/2019, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yea she must be in a lecture then. Her break is usually around 11:30. Well you travel safe! Hoping rains haven't affected your trains
04/09/2019, 08:31 - Bee: The trains are on time. I'll let you know when I reach home
04/09/2019, 08:36 - Bee: She's leaving!!!!!
04/09/2019, 08:36 - Nischal Abraham: Oh!! I guess that's who my mom was on the phone with
04/09/2019, 08:47 - Bee: Yes must've been Nidhi
04/09/2019, 08:48 - Nischal Abraham: So you're coming back with her?
04/09/2019, 08:48 - Bee: No... Im in a Vashi-Thane train
04/09/2019, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Oh okay
04/09/2019, 09:49 - Bee: I just reached home
04/09/2019, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! Proper half day for you ^_^
04/09/2019, 10:18 - Bee: Yes 🥺☺
04/09/2019, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: So what's your plans for the day?
04/09/2019, 10:19 - Bee: I don't have any plans...I want to go for a walk in the evening. That's all
04/09/2019, 10:26 - Nischal Abraham: A walk in the rains... Sounds like a plan to me
04/09/2019, 10:50 - Bee: Now it is
04/09/2019, 10:50 - Bee: But it's not raining anymore
04/09/2019, 10:50 - Bee: Has Nidhi reached home?
04/09/2019, 10:50 - Nischal Abraham: She did 10 min back
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Bee: Okay
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Bee: What are your plans?
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: It'll start raining again when you go for the walk
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Bee: I have a feeling it will
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Bee: That always happens 😂
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be going to James uncles place at 4
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: Teaching Nathan guitar
04/09/2019, 10:51 - Bee: Oh wow.
04/09/2019, 10:52 - Bee: I didn't know he was learning how to play
04/09/2019, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: He wasn't. This is lesson 1 😂
04/09/2019, 10:55 - Bee: 😂
04/09/2019, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: But he said he's interested... I never turn down anyone who's interested
04/09/2019, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: If I can help it
04/09/2019, 10:55 - Bee: You can teach someone to play in less than 10 days?! Where do I sign up?
04/09/2019, 10:55 - Bee: You're kind
04/09/2019, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: I can teach you to *learn* how to play in 10 days. There's very very little that can be taught at a beginner level for guitar
04/09/2019, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: It's mostly about practicing and getting used to holding and playing a guitar in the beginning
04/09/2019, 10:57 - Bee: Oh!! Then I think I've passed this level. I pestered Wilson to teach me. But then he moved to Pune
04/09/2019, 10:57 - Bee: But that was a decade ago
04/09/2019, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: WHAT!!? You know how to hold the guitar? (・o・)
04/09/2019, 10:58 - Bee: 😂😎 I do.
04/09/2019, 10:59 - Bee: So you're not free at all?
04/09/2019, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! It becomes difficult to improve if you don't have your own guitar to practice on
04/09/2019, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sure I am... I don't think I can teach anymore than 5 😂
04/09/2019, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: That's why I said I'd meet him early... I'll have the evening free
04/09/2019, 11:00 - Bee: Have you taught anyone before?
04/09/2019, 11:01 - Bee: Oh
04/09/2019, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: Never officially. By official I mean I've never been paid for it. And it's never consistent. So only friends who've had a passing interest in learning how to play the guitar
04/09/2019, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: I taught them enough to play one or two songs... Then they didn't want to learn anymore :(
04/09/2019, 11:06 - Bee: Aww Nischal
04/09/2019, 11:06 - Bee: You have Nathan now
04/09/2019, 11:06 - Bee: He's a good boy
04/09/2019, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Doesn't mean he'll necessarily want to continue playing the guitar. But I'm glad he came forward and asked me to teach him anyway 😊
04/09/2019, 11:19 - Bee: That's true. You two can bond while you're at it.
04/09/2019, 11:19 - Bee: Have a nice time, Nischal! :)
04/09/2019, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'll make the best of it 😁. Cya later!
04/09/2019, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: When are you planning on going for a walk?
04/09/2019, 07:26 - Nischal Abraham: Switched my number to prepaid. And there's a lot of hidden clauses stuff that needs to be done to get it up and running. I think I'm mostly done with everything... Now my Amazon Prime membership is cancelled so I'm seeing how I can get that resolved.
04/09/2019, 13:51 - Bee: I fell asleep. I'll go in like 15 minutes
04/09/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Oh there's my laptop message 🤣
04/09/2019, 13:52 - Bee: 😂 yes I figured
04/09/2019, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: I thought as much. I was going to ask if I could join you on your walk? (You can say no if you want to... )
04/09/2019, 13:57 - Bee: Why would I say no?!
04/09/2019, 13:57 - Bee: Yes you can
04/09/2019, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Cause everyone likes their alone time... And if this is your alone time I don't want to be intruding
04/09/2019, 13:59 - Bee: No this isn't my alone time
04/09/2019, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll take a while to get there... So you can start walking anyway. Man these are things I miss not staying closer to Vasant Vihar 😂
04/09/2019, 14:04 - Bee: 😂 it's okay there isn't much here anyway
04/09/2019, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: You're there
04/09/2019, 14:07 - Bee: Hahaha. Cheese. I like.
04/09/2019, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Terrible cheese. I was gonna add an emoji but that seemed too much
04/09/2019, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: So where am I going?
04/09/2019, 14:09 - Bee: I haven't left yet. I'll meet you at Meadows? We could walk from there
04/09/2019, 14:09 - Bee: Or the park near Bethany
04/09/2019, 14:09 - Bee: Not terrible
04/09/2019, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: Let's meet at meadows. We can walk from there
04/09/2019, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: I just got into an auto
04/09/2019, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for allowing me to joing you on your walk
04/09/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: And for bearing with my random introduction to everyone I've ever met
04/09/2019, 18:13 - Bee: Thank you for joining me
04/09/2019, 18:13 - Bee: I hope I remember everyone and everything
04/09/2019, 18:13 - Bee: How are the noodles?
04/09/2019, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: The noodles had a bit too much masala. Mom makes custom masala for Maggi 😋. Though I was too late to join in the cooking process...
04/09/2019, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: No pressure on remembering Debs... I'll keep bringing them up from time to time... Anyone I don't bring up again are people even I've forgotten so yea
04/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Whoa! Custom masala and all. Also, my fault that you joined late. Sorry.
04/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: I shall remember that
04/09/2019, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be... Never a wasted moment spent with you
04/09/2019, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: And custom masala cause the default one has peanuts in it. And mom has allergies
04/09/2019, 18:45 - Bee: Starred this message.
04/09/2019, 18:46 - Bee: I usually don't walk so much. But I forget when I'm walking with you
04/09/2019, 18:46 - Bee: Oh
04/09/2019, 18:46 - Bee: Does it taste like the Maggi masala?
04/09/2019, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's the same for me. I get bored walking alone if I'm going nowhere... But it's nice when it's someone I can talk to 😌
04/09/2019, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Not the same... But it's good nonetheless
04/09/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Yes. It's nice when I can listen to you talk
04/09/2019, 19:14 - Bee: I'm sure it is...
04/09/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Is that sarcasm? 😅. I'm sorry I was talking waaay too much today
04/09/2019, 19:22 - Bee: Nooo not sarcasm
04/09/2019, 19:23 - Bee: Not sleeping yet?
04/09/2019, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: I will... Maybe not immediately. Feel like playing my guitar
04/09/2019, 19:25 - Bee: Oh..I'm off to bed. I need to leave early because I have to go to the hospital
04/09/2019, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea! Have a fun day tomorrow 😊
04/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: Yes! I'm looking forward to the OT experience
04/09/2019, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!!
04/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
05/09/2019, 03:48 - Bee: Hi I'm at home today 😃😌
05/09/2019, 04:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/09/2019, 05:02 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! Got an off from the hospital?
05/09/2019, 05:04 - Nischal Abraham: This is lovely. I never experienced this side of Pinterest
05/09/2019, 05:04 - Bee: Yes
05/09/2019, 05:04 - Bee: Yes. :) I love this side of Pinterest
05/09/2019, 05:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well today I'm going to endeavour to get an Instagram account up and running. Out of Facebook or Insta I think the latter is a higher possibility of working out
05/09/2019, 05:06 - Nischal Abraham: Btw even Nidhi is home today 😁
05/09/2019, 05:09 - Bee: Woohoooooooooo!! I never thought I'd see this day
05/09/2019, 05:09 - Bee: Yes I messaged her in the morning
05/09/2019, 05:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not sure if it'll work out. As long as I'm using this number I may never be able to make one. But let's see
05/09/2019, 06:06 - Nischal Abraham: Btw Debby. We need to talk... More like I need to talk about something that you'll have to listen to
05/09/2019, 06:43 - Bee: What does it have to do with your number?
05/09/2019, 06:49 - Bee: Alright. 'We need to talk' doesn't end well. At least not in movies. But I probably shouldn't learn from movies.
05/09/2019, 06:49 - Bee: When? What time?
05/09/2019, 06:52 - Nischal Abraham: Instagram blocked my number for violating T&C. Well looks like I somehow managed to activate both
05/09/2019, 06:53 - Nischal Abraham: Facebook is filled with memories of pre 2015 😮
05/09/2019, 06:53 - Nischal Abraham: Also I finished up unfriending all the people I don't recognize in my friends list. Time to filter better
05/09/2019, 06:55 - Nischal Abraham: Soon... Definitely before Saturday. I don't know how possible it'll be to meet and talk face to face before then. Probably over a phone call if nothing else
05/09/2019, 06:56 - Nischal Abraham: I keep thinking of situations from "in the movies" and so far I've always predicted things incorrectly. So I'm going to stop trying... Take each moment as it comes
05/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: You thought I would run away and sing. Run away? Okay. But sing?!?!??!?!?!??!???? 😛
05/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: That's good right? You can tell me more stories
05/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: What did you do?!
05/09/2019, 07:09 - Bee: You and Nidhi will be coming to Shiphrah akka's place together right?
05/09/2019, 07:10 - Bee: Patience is not my forte. I'm still learning
05/09/2019, 07:11 - Nischal Abraham: Now you can stalk the stories yourself 😂
05/09/2019, 07:12 - Nischal Abraham: Something. It somehow worked out. Well my insta is just nischalabraham. I'm not linking it to Facebook incase they realise that it's my blocked account 🤣
05/09/2019, 07:13 - Bee: 😂. I'll know what you're talking about before you even tell me. That doesn't sound creepy at all.
05/09/2019, 07:13 - Bee: I meant what did you do to violate T&C
05/09/2019, 07:14 - Bee: 😂
05/09/2019, 07:15 - Bee: Also, you got to keep your name as the handle! Nice.
05/09/2019, 07:15 - Bee: Are you ptolemy95 as well?!
05/09/2019, 07:16 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know. I guess because I didn't deactivate it and it was inactive for so many years they blocked it? Also Nidhi and I will be there for dinner tomorrow
05/09/2019, 07:17 - Nischal Abraham: Oh is that my old handle? Sounds like it's mine. It's either that or unknwnlistener
05/09/2019, 07:27 - Bee: That's all? They're mean.
05/09/2019, 07:27 - Bee: I asked to know whether we could meet before dinner. But we can't
05/09/2019, 07:27 - Bee: Yes it is. Couldn't find the second one.
05/09/2019, 07:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'll probably just give you a call and talk
05/09/2019, 07:49 - Bee: Alright
05/09/2019, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: But why can't be meet before dinner?
05/09/2019, 07:56 - Bee: Because you're coming with Nidhi?
05/09/2019, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: OH yes I didn't think of that
05/09/2019, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: Well we'll meet at Shiphrah's 😁
05/09/2019, 09:35 - Bee: Unless what you want to say can be said in front of Nidhi. Which I doubt
05/09/2019, 09:35 - Bee: Yes!
05/09/2019, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: You doubt correctly... But we could technically still meet before dinner. Just that I won't be talking about the thing I want to talk about
05/09/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be coming for the Bible Study?
05/09/2019, 13:32 - Bee: Hey yes I'll be coming
05/09/2019, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be avoiding me? 😂
05/09/2019, 13:33 - Bee: 😂 somebody has to go keep the books...
05/09/2019, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
05/09/2019, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome... I look forward to it 😋
05/09/2019, 13:34 - Bee: Look forward to being avoided? 😂
05/09/2019, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sure! It's a very active action to take up. It means you're very keenly observing where I am. And that's just sweet
05/09/2019, 13:37 - Bee: Nawwwwww. How do you do that?!
05/09/2019, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: How do I do what?
05/09/2019, 13:38 - Bee: Give such cute answers
05/09/2019, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: I think it's cute that you think it's cute. I thought it was more cheese and I've got cheese for days
05/09/2019, 14:00 - Bee: It's good that I love cheese then.
05/09/2019, 17:20 - Bee: Hey. I just got my results. 😭
05/09/2019, 17:20 - Bee: I passed. With distinction. I'm not worthy of it. 😭
05/09/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Thank you for praying, Nischal. :)
05/09/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Omigoodness Debby!!! That's awesome!!
05/09/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Praising God for all his goodness 🙌🏻
05/09/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Congratulations 😊
05/09/2019, 17:43 - Bee: #Godonlygood. #MeRags.
05/09/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Yes. :')
05/09/2019, 17:44 - Bee: This is from an old meme. I'll send it to you.
05/09/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'm aware of the meme. I was there :P
05/09/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Oh. Sorry. :P
05/09/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: It's true though. God is good. So you've got college tomorrow I'm guessing
05/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Going to the hospital tomorrow. No college for a week now
05/09/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Well that means getting up earlier in the morning right?
05/09/2019, 17:51 - Bee: Yes. I have to leave at 6
05/09/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Well let me know when you'll be free for a phone call. Won't take long... It's not a life story this time. Just something I feel I should let you know
05/09/2019, 17:55 - Bee: Okay. What time will you go to sleep tonight?
05/09/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: I can stay up. Definitely not before 12
05/09/2019, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: We haven't had our family prayer yet so that'll probably happen soon. Things got a bit delayed today
05/09/2019, 17:57 - Bee: Okay. I'll be up as well
05/09/2019, 17:57 - Bee: Everything okay?
05/09/2019, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yea yea... Tuesdays and Thursdays dinner is after we get back home which is usually 9 😅
05/09/2019, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Anywho. I'll message once we're through. Talk to you in a bit :)
05/09/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Oh.
05/09/2019, 18:12 - Bee: I'll be here.
05/09/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'm back
05/09/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: So let me know when you can talk
05/09/2019, 18:23 - Bee: Yes. I have a little of this research work to finish
05/09/2019, 18:23 - Bee: Please don't stay up on my account
05/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time... It's on your convenience. I have nowhere to be
05/09/2019, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: If you get too late that's fine. We can just talk tomorrow
05/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: Hey
05/09/2019, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Hello
05/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: I don't know what time I'll be done
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: I was sitting with the parents and praying and talking... Didn't get any work done
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: I may take some time
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's alright. Sounds like time well spent
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: I'm sorry
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Refer to this
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: Yes it was
05/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: Noted. Tomorrow then?
05/09/2019, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Why are you sorry? 😅
05/09/2019, 19:28 - Bee: You stayed up
05/09/2019, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: It's fine... I'd be staying up regardless. Not like I have anywhere to be tomorrow 😂
05/09/2019, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Please don't feel bad for this. You'll make me feel bad :(
05/09/2019, 19:29 - Bee: What about packing?! And your lists?!
05/09/2019, 19:29 - Bee: I really wanted to talk. Or listen.
05/09/2019, 19:29 - Bee: I won't.
05/09/2019, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: You can listen tomorrow... Without any time constraints
05/09/2019, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Those don't need me to go anywhere. My shopping is nearly complete... Should be completely done tomorrow actually
05/09/2019, 19:31 - Bee: Oh cool. Then you won't have to worry about shopping in your last week here
05/09/2019, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Let's hope not. I'm expecting a last minute missed item anyway
05/09/2019, 19:33 - Bee: Yes. Me. :P
05/09/2019, 19:33 - Bee: Sorry.
05/09/2019, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: I'm laughing and crying at the same time
05/09/2019, 19:34 - Bee: 😂😂
05/09/2019, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: That was cute ☺. Well you should get back to work... Don't want to keep you up longer than you have to
05/09/2019, 19:36 - Bee: Yes I should go start now
05/09/2019, 19:36 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
05/09/2019, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee :)
06/09/2019, 02:27 - Bee: Nischal!!
06/09/2019, 02:27 - Bee: Good morning. :)
06/09/2019, 04:23 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! Enjoy your day of babies and mothers :D
06/09/2019, 08:33 - Bee: Hey!! It's been a good day so far. Babies and mothers everywhere.
06/09/2019, 08:34 - Bee: How's your day been so far?
06/09/2019, 08:34 - Bee: Getting work done?
06/09/2019, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'm just leaving from Matunga. Late lunch today as well
06/09/2019, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: Btw... What's your handle on Instagram?
06/09/2019, 09:49 - Bee: Matunga?!
06/09/2019, 09:49 - Bee: Menezesdebby
06/09/2019, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yea leftover items to buy. There's a shop here that sells really good winter wear
06/09/2019, 12:02 - Bee: Ahh
06/09/2019, 12:02 - Bee: I had a nice day at the hospital
06/09/2019, 12:02 - Bee: I got to hold so many newborns
06/09/2019, 12:02 - Bee: 🥺
06/09/2019, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... That's so sweet!
06/09/2019, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry for the late reply I had met up with Siby aunty
06/09/2019, 14:21 - Bee: Hey don't be sorry
06/09/2019, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for being sorry
06/09/2019, 14:54 - Bee: 😂
06/09/2019, 19:02 - Bee: I have this tiny piece of information to tell you
06/09/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Sleeping?
06/09/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Not yet
06/09/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Can I call?
06/09/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Can I call you in 10? Will you go to sleep by then?
06/09/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Won't sleep so soon. Send me a message when you're free :)
06/09/2019, 19:18 - Bee: I will.
06/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: Hi
06/09/2019, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
06/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: Can I call you?
07/09/2019, 01:54 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
07/09/2019, 01:55 - Bee: I prayed and I'll continue to pray for you and Radhika and the visit.
07/09/2019, 01:57 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! Thank you for praying. God led me to an interesting portion this morning... Somehow finding hope and comfort through Lamentations seems ironic
07/09/2019, 02:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a wonderful day ahead! To see God's wonder and experience His mercy continually :)
07/09/2019, 02:55 - Bee: What portion were you reading?
07/09/2019, 02:55 - Bee: I'm telling you God does have a sense of humour
07/09/2019, 02:57 - Bee: I read Philippians 4 this morning... And to know that it's a book which has themes of gratitude and rejoicing but was written in a prison is comforting
07/09/2019, 03:12 - Bee: I hope you have an injury free day.
07/09/2019, 03:13 - Bee: It's such a pretty day outside!!
07/09/2019, 04:55 - Nischal Abraham: I was reading Lamentations 3. What stood out for me was v22-24. All through the start it's all a complaint of how things are going bad... Very direct and honest. But above it all was the Lord's mercy
07/09/2019, 04:57 - Nischal Abraham: God's sense of humour is way higher than ours... More than mortal man could comprehend 😂. I love the whole book of Phillipians! Just reading about themes of rejoicing brings me to rejoice along with the Bible
07/09/2019, 04:59 - Nischal Abraham: Today was fairly injury free. Rolf's old injury hasn't healed yet but he's able to walk so it's all good. My next bout of sadness is gonna hit soon realising this is my last football match here.

And yes, the sun really did make today a pretty day
07/09/2019, 06:14 - Bee: Yes!!! Beauty out of ashes kinda thing. I like that portion
07/09/2019, 06:14 - Bee: Phew. That's good. The injury free part. Not Rolfs injury.
07/09/2019, 06:14 - Bee: Most of the things you do this week will be the 'last' time you get to do it :(
07/09/2019, 06:23 - Nischal Abraham: That's true... I should just brace for impact and let it happen
07/09/2019, 07:21 - Bee: This message was deleted
07/09/2019, 08:19 - Bee: I wanted to ask you something. That's the needle which I deleted
07/09/2019, 08:20 - Bee: Message*
07/09/2019, 08:20 - Bee: I'll ask you later.
07/09/2019, 08:20 - Nischal Abraham: Okay...
07/09/2019, 08:21 - Nischal Abraham: The pretty day has become prettier for you
07/09/2019, 08:21 - Bee: How is that?
07/09/2019, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know about where you are... But it's raining really heavy here
07/09/2019, 08:24 - Bee: Oh!! 😍
07/09/2019, 08:24 - Bee: It's not raining heavily here but it's very pleasant 😌
07/09/2019, 08:24 - Bee: Cloudy and gloomy
07/09/2019, 08:25 - Nischal Abraham: I was gonna take a photo... But camera isn't good enough to capture the rain
07/09/2019, 08:26 - Bee: That's okay!!
07/09/2019, 08:26 - Bee: Send a photo
07/09/2019, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/09/2019, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: Tis the view from my window
07/09/2019, 08:28 - Bee: I believe you 😂
07/09/2019, 08:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... Well you can see the gutters have filled up. That doesn't happen with light rains
07/09/2019, 08:30 - Bee: I see gutters in this photo
07/09/2019, 08:31 - Bee: No gutters*
07/09/2019, 08:31 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly
07/09/2019, 08:32 - Bee: 😱
07/09/2019, 08:32 - Bee: Mind=blown
07/09/2019, 08:33 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. Some things are better experienced in person
07/09/2019, 08:40 - Bee: 😂. I hope it still rains when I'm back
07/09/2019, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: Did you get your rains?
07/09/2019, 14:28 - Bee: Yes! Time for a walk now.
07/09/2019, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... Enjoy your walk Debby. I won't be able to accompany you today :(
07/09/2019, 14:39 - Bee: :(
07/09/2019, 14:40 - Bee: I hope I get to walk with you at least once before you leave.
07/09/2019, 14:40 - Bee: Have fun at whatever you're doing. Be in the moment. Bye!
07/09/2019, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your walk! I'm not really doing anything... Won't be able to travel in these rains to get there
07/09/2019, 14:42 - Bee: Ahh. That's okay
07/09/2019, 14:50 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know if its possible to be on a call today. Otherwise we'll just meet tomorrow
07/09/2019, 14:54 - Bee: Yes I'll message you
07/09/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: ^_________^
07/09/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Hey
07/09/2019, 18:05 - Bee: I just came back from my 'walk'.
07/09/2019, 18:05 - Bee: I'll tell you about it.
07/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Have you gone to sleep?
07/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Then I feel stupid for asking.
07/09/2019, 18:44 - Bee: And I had a lot of time to think
07/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: And I realised that the questions I wanted to ask you were because of my rocky emotions.
07/09/2019, 18:48 - Bee: And I'm still learning how to not act on my emotions. Please bear with me.
07/09/2019, 18:48 - Bee: You'll probably read all of this in the morning.
07/09/2019, 18:48 - Bee: So good morning, Nischal. :)
07/09/2019, 18:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/09/2019, 18:56 - Bee: See you!
08/09/2019, 02:33 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! I fell asleep so early yesterday... I didn't sleep in the afternoon and I was tired from football. 

I see you had a lot to think about. I'd love to hear about it
08/09/2019, 02:36 - Nischal Abraham: I don't really know what you're feeling... But it feels like you're struggling with something. I'm struggling too but I feel assured about certain things that keep me focused on God.

I'm praying for you. Take your time with what you want to share. Let's talk :) (preferably not over chat cause things just get confusing here)
08/09/2019, 02:38 - Bee: I am struggling with something. And yes, not over chat.
08/09/2019, 02:38 - Bee: I will tell you all of it. Maybe later today.
08/09/2019, 09:55 - Bee: 🤗😴
08/09/2019, 10:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey... Is that a riddle? Going to sleep?
08/09/2019, 11:52 - Bee: Well done
08/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: 🤗😴
08/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: Time fries when I'm with you 🍟
08/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: Goodnight!
08/09/2019, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: They're so cheesy!! I love it 😂
08/09/2019, 19:08 - Bee: 😂😂
08/09/2019, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I'll continue conversation tomorrow
08/09/2019, 19:09 - Bee: Alright. Goodnight :).
09/09/2019, 02:21 - Bee: When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?
09/09/2019, 04:36 - Nischal Abraham: It wasn't fixed till the 8th standard. I know there was a time I wanted to be a footballer, then a professional musician. But I was never ambitious enough to think of them as real careers to pursue
09/09/2019, 04:37 - Nischal Abraham: In the 8th I was introduced to programming... And I haven't looked back since
09/09/2019, 04:37 - Nischal Abraham: Well there was a brief period of time I wanted to develop games... But that desire died down too
09/09/2019, 06:01 - Bee: Ahh! You were ambitious enough to think of an unusual career though
09/09/2019, 06:01 - Bee: I always stuck with medicine ever since I was 5
09/09/2019, 06:09 - Nischal Abraham: You knew what you wanted to do so young! That's amazing too. And you stuck with it!!
09/09/2019, 07:09 - Bee: Kinda...I spent a lot of time in Lok in my early years waiting for papa to drop me to school. And so many missionaries would come for a few weeks (Stephen uncle's contacts). They would tell me stories about the places they were serving in
09/09/2019, 07:10 - Bee: And I would sit there in awe hoping God would send me someplace too
09/09/2019, 07:10 - Bee: I could never imagine myself doing anything else
09/09/2019, 07:20 - Nischal Abraham: I remember you shared about this before. Maybe God will lead you someplace to serve Him
09/09/2019, 07:21 - Nischal Abraham: Do you still feel the same way now?
09/09/2019, 07:54 - Bee: I don't...back then I thought that's the only way to serve God because that's what I saw. But not I know that's not true
09/09/2019, 07:54 - Bee: Now*
09/09/2019, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Hey have you seen a TV show called This Is Us?
09/09/2019, 11:58 - Bee: No I haven't. I've heard about it though
09/09/2019, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi just got me started on it. Real emotional show... You'll probably like it too. But if you have things to do then don't start this show 😂
09/09/2019, 12:11 - Bee: 😂
I can make time for an emotional TV show 😛
09/09/2019, 12:11 - Bee: Were you binge-watching today?
09/09/2019, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Na... I've learnt the art of self-control for TV shows
09/09/2019, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: The trick is to waste time watching YouTube videos
09/09/2019, 12:12 - Bee: Hahahaha
09/09/2019, 12:12 - Bee: You have to teach me a thing or two about self control
09/09/2019, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I was being sarcastic. My self control does NOT lead to productive activities
09/09/2019, 12:14 - Bee: What YouTube videos do you watch?
09/09/2019, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Random recommendations. YouTube has narrowed that down to a few channels now... TwoSetViolin, FineBros, Nigahiga, some guitar related stuff
09/09/2019, 12:17 - Bee: That's more productive than what I watch on YouTube. :P
09/09/2019, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: What do you watch? If you don't mind me asking...
09/09/2019, 12:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/09/2019, 12:20 - Bee: And this YouTuber called Safiya Nygaard who tries weird stuff.
09/09/2019, 12:21 - Bee: Oh and snippets of The tonight show
09/09/2019, 12:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I know her... She's the BuzzFeed girl who got out
09/09/2019, 12:22 - Bee: Yes!!!
09/09/2019, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: I've got Conan O'Brien in my feed
09/09/2019, 12:22 - Bee: Oh!! I'm not as ashamed now
09/09/2019, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: This sounds interesting... Never heard of it
09/09/2019, 12:26 - Bee: Say yes to the dress. That's what it's called. I'm not trying to get you to watch it
09/09/2019, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: I probably wouldn't want to hear about it either... No offence 🤣
09/09/2019, 12:27 - Bee: 😂 none taken
09/09/2019, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: Do you comment on YouTube videos?
09/09/2019, 12:30 - Bee: No I don't. I'm not that brave
09/09/2019, 12:30 - Bee: Do you?
09/09/2019, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: I used to sometimes... On smaller videos to encourage the channel. But there's too much content and too little commitment from my end to comment
09/09/2019, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Probably for the best. I'd just be a needle in the haystack
09/09/2019, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: And everything I'd want to say is usually already said. I just enjoy reading some of the comment section
09/09/2019, 12:33 - Bee: 🥺
09/09/2019, 12:33 - Nischal Abraham: What?
09/09/2019, 12:33 - Bee: To encourage the channel
09/09/2019, 12:33 - Bee: Who thinks of that?!
09/09/2019, 12:33 - Bee: Nice.
09/09/2019, 12:33 - Bee: I do too!!
09/09/2019, 12:36 - Bee: Have you heard of the butterfly effect?
09/09/2019, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/dFQtSG9nPzU
09/09/2019, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yes I have
09/09/2019, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: This is one of the older channels I found... They stopped posting music... But I heard them first in 2013. All their songs are nice 😊
09/09/2019, 12:39 - Bee: I don't have earphones. I'll have to listen to it once I reach home
09/09/2019, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Take it slow Debby
09/09/2019, 12:40 - Bee: Oh that's when they just started
09/09/2019, 12:40 - Bee: 😂
09/09/2019, 12:43 - Bee: This reminded me of that effect
09/09/2019, 12:44 - Bee: The first time I read about it was because of this romance novel called The butterfly project
09/09/2019, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Well I highly doubt my one comment made any difference. The channels I've commented in have all died out over time 😅
09/09/2019, 12:44 - Bee: Hahahaha
09/09/2019, 12:44 - Bee: What did you do?!?!
09/09/2019, 12:45 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Maybe it is the butterfly effect!! Just negatively
09/09/2019, 12:46 - Bee: Yep. Still the butterfly effect
09/09/2019, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: I should start commenting on all the channels I hate!
09/09/2019, 12:46 - Bee: NOT THIS ONE
09/09/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Well I haven't watched it yet so I can't hate it
09/09/2019, 12:48 - Bee: Good. Don't watch it.
09/09/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I have an Instagram doubt. Is it rude if I don't follow back someone who's following me because I don't know who they are?
09/09/2019, 12:49 - Bee: You should check out jobinsam on Instagram
09/09/2019, 12:49 - Bee: No it's not rude
09/09/2019, 12:49 - Bee: Do you have a problem with them following you? Is your account public?
09/09/2019, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that brings me to my next doubt... How did you make your account private?
09/09/2019, 12:50 - Bee: Settings
Privacy
Account privacy
09/09/2019, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay. I'll do that... But won't it be even more rude to not accept people's requests then?
09/09/2019, 12:51 - Bee: No no it's okay
09/09/2019, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: What if I do know them but don't recognize their name
09/09/2019, 12:51 - Bee: So cute.
09/09/2019, 12:51 - Bee: They'll have a display photo right
09/09/2019, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: How is this cute? 🙃
09/09/2019, 12:52 - Bee: You wondering whether it'll be rude to not accept people's requests on Instagram is cute
09/09/2019, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I figured out who he is. So his display pic was just his name in a graphic
09/09/2019, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: But his profile isn't private so I saw his photo
09/09/2019, 12:52 - Bee: Oh. Okay?
09/09/2019, 12:53 - Bee: So are you following him back?
09/09/2019, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I don't enjoy his content
09/09/2019, 12:53 - Bee: Okay
09/09/2019, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: Is there a way to filter my feed even if I do follow someone?
09/09/2019, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Like hide his posts for me in the general stuff but still follow the person
09/09/2019, 12:54 - Bee: Yes
09/09/2019, 12:54 - Bee: You can mute
09/09/2019, 12:54 - Bee: Open any post and click on the three dots on the top right
09/09/2019, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh found it
09/09/2019, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea Joyce is taking over my timeline 😶
09/09/2019, 12:55 - Bee: Ahh yes. She does post a lot
09/09/2019, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: I don't mind cute kid pics sometimes... But every second post is hers
09/09/2019, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it's cause I'm not following enough people. I'll leave it be for now
09/09/2019, 12:56 - Bee: I understand
09/09/2019, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Next mean question for social media... Do people get notified when they're unfollowed?
09/09/2019, 12:59 - Bee: No. You're safe
09/09/2019, 12:59 - Bee: But there are these other apps using which they can find out
09/09/2019, 12:59 - Bee: But that's okay!!
09/09/2019, 12:59 - Bee: Go unfollow!!
09/09/2019, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's fine. If they go through that much effort they deserve to know 😂
09/09/2019, 13:00 - Bee: 😂
I used to do that when I was in the 11th-12th. :P
09/09/2019, 13:01 - Bee: Not unfollow. Find out if anyone unfollowed me
09/09/2019, 13:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I used to care a lot about that too. The numbers used to be a milestone on Facebook and Twitter
09/09/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Are you on your way back home?
09/09/2019, 13:03 - Bee: Yes. I'll reach thane station in about 3 minutes
09/09/2019, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice... The rains are here to welcome you ☺
09/09/2019, 13:05 - Bee: 😂. I'll be ready with my umbrella
09/09/2019, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: What is a secret talent you have that nobody or very few other people know about?
09/09/2019, 13:12 - Bee: I can flip pancakes without using a spatula. 9 out of 10 times. Does that count?
09/09/2019, 13:13 - Bee: What's yours?
09/09/2019, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... That is impressive!
09/09/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: I always forget the question can be asked straight back 😂. Uh... I already revealed this but I can solve a Rubik's cube
09/09/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: When I started I could do it under 2 min but now I'm out of practice
09/09/2019, 13:20 - Bee: That's a talent I would like to have but I don't have the patience to learn
09/09/2019, 13:21 - Nischal Abraham: I learnt it in two days. You can actually learn it in a few hours no problem
09/09/2019, 13:22 - Bee: Teach me after Ireland. Right before you continue your 27 minutes RGB lesson
09/09/2019, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
09/09/2019, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing... I got inspired by a YouTuber to learn actually
09/09/2019, 13:23 - Bee: How long did he take to finish it?
09/09/2019, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/DDqh8DZjf-4
09/09/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: Check it out when you get home... But it's not one of this best videos... Hold up. I'll share my favourite video of his
09/09/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/gCUBERZibMg
09/09/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Watch this one! It really explores the idea of learning and how anyone can learn anything if you put the time to it
09/09/2019, 13:28 - Bee: I think you mentioned him in Delhi
09/09/2019, 13:28 - Bee: Before or after you solved the Rubik's cube
09/09/2019, 13:28 - Bee: I will
09/09/2019, 13:28 - Bee: Right after Take it slow
09/09/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I probably did... It was around the time I started watching his videos. There's something really satisfying about seeing someone learn a new skill. Especially watching the whole process
09/09/2019, 13:35 - Bee: I should check him out
09/09/2019, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: Right after Take It Slow 😋
09/09/2019, 13:36 - Bee: Got it.
09/09/2019, 13:36 - Bee: Is this a special one for you?
09/09/2019, 13:41 - Nischal Abraham: Not the song in itself... Just the artist who sang it. They're a couple who released only 3-4 songs but they're all so lovely
09/09/2019, 13:43 - Bee: Okay :)
09/09/2019, 13:44 - Bee: The sky looks gorgeous rn
09/09/2019, 14:23 - Bee: I like it a lot!!
09/09/2019, 14:23 - Bee: And all their other songs as well
09/09/2019, 14:24 - Bee: They're a cute couple. I watched the two video docs they uploaded
09/09/2019, 14:38 - Bee: Also, will you be free for a little while in the evening this week? Even if it's just for a few minutes. I could come to hiranandani estate
09/09/2019, 14:38 - Bee: If not, I understand
09/09/2019, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: This week, yes. Today, nope
09/09/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Okay. Let me know
09/09/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Whenever...
09/09/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Came for dinner to Shany aunty's house. You've got an off tomorrow?
09/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: I don't
09/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: Hi I was sleeping
09/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: I don't have a holiday on Thursday either
09/09/2019, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Make the most of it
09/09/2019, 19:31 - Bee: You're awake!!!
09/09/2019, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: Came back home from there just half an hour back
09/09/2019, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished with family prayer
09/09/2019, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Staying up all night now?
09/09/2019, 19:39 - Bee: No I'll sleep for an hour... Maybe at 4
09/09/2019, 19:39 - Bee: I can't stay up all night
09/09/2019, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: I always wondered how medical professionals function after sleepless nights... If anyone needs to be at maximum capabilities it should be people taking care of people
09/09/2019, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: But alas alack... This the world we live in
09/09/2019, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I can feel a wave of sadness building within me... It hasn't hit me yet but it's like I'm on a seashore watching the wave come towards me
09/09/2019, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished round 1 of packing... The suitcases are now full of stuff
09/09/2019, 19:43 - Bee: Aww Nischal
09/09/2019, 19:43 - Bee: It gets worse
09/09/2019, 19:43 - Bee: Until you have to leave
09/09/2019, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: I can't even imagine having to say goodbye to you
09/09/2019, 19:44 - Bee: But you're not saying goodbye
09/09/2019, 19:44 - Bee: I feel like the time was too short
09/09/2019, 19:45 - Bee: I just started talking and getting to know you
09/09/2019, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: You feel that way because the time WAS too short 😂
09/09/2019, 19:45 - Bee: I wish I'd spoken to you years ago. Not about me liking you but as friends
09/09/2019, 19:45 - Bee: Oh Nischal
09/09/2019, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I missed this with everyone
09/09/2019, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: And it's only recently I realised that the friends I want to keep are the ones who love Jesus with me
09/09/2019, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: And they're the ones I always kept an arm's length away
09/09/2019, 19:47 - Bee: The thing you told Arpitha on Ben's last Sunday.. about her being here after God started changing the youth... That's when you got close too. So you haven't missed much
09/09/2019, 19:48 - Bee: I'm just being selfish because now I want all of that time back. Only because I want to be in the same country as you longer
09/09/2019, 19:49 - Bee: You'll make these friends there as well
09/09/2019, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: We never really did talk at all before did we?
09/09/2019, 19:50 - Bee: We didn't
09/09/2019, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: I can't seem to figure out why
09/09/2019, 19:51 - Bee: But maybe you wouldn't have liked me if we were good friends. Probably because you wouldn't want to ruin the friendship. I'm just consoling myself
09/09/2019, 19:51 - Bee: I was too busy with Ben and Sahil. And Reenee. Never bothered to make other friends
09/09/2019, 19:52 - Bee: I had a hard time when Arpitha came...I didn't let her in for almost a year
09/09/2019, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: I just saw you as Nidhi's friend and Ashley's sister... Age difference mattered a lot more when we were younger
09/09/2019, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: It mattered to me is what I'm saying... Feels silly but that's the thinking I was surrounded by
09/09/2019, 19:53 - Bee: I understand. It doesn't feel like much now
09/09/2019, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's great that you're saying it... Cause I felt it even when I was in college. Just the way peers would react to the idea of it somehow subconsciously shaped my thinking
09/09/2019, 19:55 - Bee: The age difference of 2 years? That's been my ideal ever since I started dreaming about marriage
09/09/2019, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: I just remembered a memory from when I was really young... Remind me to tell you when I meet you next. It's a conversation I had with my mom
09/09/2019, 19:57 - Bee: Give me a key word
09/09/2019, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: My ideal for marriage when I was a kid
09/09/2019, 19:57 - Bee: Okay. I'll remind you
09/09/2019, 19:58 - Nischal Abraham: You sound like a telegram bot on which I set a reminder :P
09/09/2019, 19:58 - Bee: We can set reminders on telegram?!?!?!
09/09/2019, 19:59 - Bee: What if I am? 🤔
09/09/2019, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: The latest has a new feature... You can set a timer for messages to be sent... Press and hold the send button
09/09/2019, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: This is WhatsApp
09/09/2019, 19:59 - Bee: Oops.
09/09/2019, 19:59 - Bee: What is it called?
09/09/2019, 20:00 - Bee: What if I'm a WhatsApp bot
09/09/2019, 20:00 - Bee: I took so long to think of this
09/09/2019, 20:00 - Bee: You can ignore these messages
09/09/2019, 20:00 - Nischal Abraham: There used to be an old one called doto... Now you can just save it in "Saved Messages" section
09/09/2019, 20:00 - Bee: Save timers?
09/09/2019, 20:01 - Bee: Oh I got it.
09/09/2019, 20:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... So kinda like sending yourself a message at a set time
09/09/2019, 20:01 - Bee: Yes
09/09/2019, 20:01 - Nischal Abraham: When did you start dreaming of marriage?
09/09/2019, 20:01 - Bee: Do you have a dimple on your right cheek?
09/09/2019, 20:01 - Bee: At the age of 13
09/09/2019, 20:02 - Nischal Abraham: I've been told I have a dimple on both cheeks... It's only prominent sometimes though
09/09/2019, 20:02 - Bee: I think it was before that but 13 is when all the Pinteresting started so I remember that
09/09/2019, 20:02 - Nischal Abraham: I used to smile a lot fuller when I was a kid
09/09/2019, 20:03 - Bee: You laughed freely a few times on Sunday and that's when I noticed
09/09/2019, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: I can't laugh like that for cameras though... I've tried, and I can't force it
09/09/2019, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have to go now? It's okay if you do... We can pick this conversation up soon :)
09/09/2019, 20:05 - Bee: I don't
09/09/2019, 20:05 - Bee: Are you sleepy?
09/09/2019, 20:05 - Bee: You must've had a long day
09/09/2019, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: No... I'm actually in a really pensive mood
09/09/2019, 20:06 - Bee: Okay. I'm here as long as you are
09/09/2019, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: But you've got to go in the morning. Please don't stay on my account okay?
09/09/2019, 20:07 - Bee: I'm staying for myself. I like talking to you. And I slept the whole evening so I'm fine.
09/09/2019, 20:07 - Bee: I should tell you to not stay up on my account
09/09/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... But I'd love to stay up for you. Also I've got nowhere to be today
09/09/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Lunch is at Siby aunty's so mom has no cooking to do either
09/09/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Oh cool so we're not sleeping for a while
09/09/2019, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Honestly, I'm not sleepy right now. Still watching the waves
09/09/2019, 20:09 - Bee: Let me know when you can't keep your eyes open
09/09/2019, 20:09 - Bee: Finally hitting you?
09/09/2019, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Not fully I don't think. But ripples of emotion creep in here and there
09/09/2019, 20:10 - Bee: Do you feel you're not prepared?
09/09/2019, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Always... Mostly with stuff. Like I have too much and not enough at the same time
09/09/2019, 20:11 - Bee: I didn't understand
09/09/2019, 20:11 - Bee: And estate does seem far far away now.
09/09/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know if I've packed enough clothes... But my bags are full so I probably must've
09/09/2019, 20:12 - Bee: Oh like that
09/09/2019, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: God's prepared my heart for the rest of it already. I don't understand how I'm not worried about going to a new country and staying alone
09/09/2019, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: Being away from friends and family that are familiar... Not a single relative whom I've met or known personally before
09/09/2019, 20:14 - Bee: I was worried when I saw you so calm...I thought maybe it hasn't sunken in yet and it'll hit you hard when it does
But time and again you mentioned that you're completely sure this is where God wants you to be
09/09/2019, 20:14 - Bee: It gives me strength to see you not worrying about ot
09/09/2019, 20:14 - Bee: It*
09/09/2019, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: God's given them the heart to help me, and given me a heart to trust them
09/09/2019, 20:15 - Bee: Most people would be terrified
09/09/2019, 20:15 - Bee: Yeah. He's gone before you
09/09/2019, 20:15 - Bee: Already prepared everything for you
09/09/2019, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Who knows... Maybe it'll hit me someday soon
09/09/2019, 20:16 - Bee: Yes and God will hold you through it like He's doing now
09/09/2019, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea He will 😌
09/09/2019, 20:18 - Bee: That's the comfort that we have...which unbelievers don't
09/09/2019, 20:18 - Bee: Life must be so uncertain for them
09/09/2019, 20:19 - Nischal Abraham: I wonder about that too
09/09/2019, 20:19 - Bee: Same. Especially when a family member of one of my friends passes away and I don't know how to give them comfort
09/09/2019, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'm usually silent... But I'll be there
09/09/2019, 20:21 - Bee: That's good.. Words don't help in such situations
09/09/2019, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: There's not a lot that can be said to assure them... And I'm not bold enough to be sharing the gospel in that moment
09/09/2019, 20:23 - Bee: I'm not either. I remember Flory aunty being that bold.. whenever someone in the colony passed away one of us had to company her to their house...and she would spend a few minutes and then ask of she can pray for them. And she would pray!! Out loud!!
09/09/2019, 20:23 - Bee: I was embarrassed when I was a child
09/09/2019, 20:23 - Bee: But now it's different
09/09/2019, 20:23 - Bee: Accompany*
09/09/2019, 20:23 - Bee: If*
09/09/2019, 20:24 - Nischal Abraham: Wow... I could never imagine doing that. I guess it is a problem I care too much what others will think
09/09/2019, 20:24 - Bee: And the family would be grateful that offered to pray
09/09/2019, 20:25 - Bee: She*
09/09/2019, 20:25 - Bee: Yes. I care too much about people too
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: I think it's hard to be Christ likely when we think like thay
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: That*
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: Like*
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: Sorry for all the typi
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: Typos* 😱
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: My fingers are sticky from caramel popcorn.
09/09/2019, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: I care too much what others will think of me... And that hinders Christ likeness. I know it's not about me but Him... And yet I'm concerned about my image
09/09/2019, 20:27 - Nischal Abraham: Wait. Popcorn?
09/09/2019, 20:27 - Nischal Abraham: At 1 in the night 😶
09/09/2019, 20:28 - Bee: Yes. There's no bad time to eat popcorn
09/09/2019, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: Of course there is... It's all the time! Isn't Popcorn loud and crunchy and will wake your whole house?
09/09/2019, 20:29 - Bee: Yes. That's why I'm sitting on the floor of the kitchen and eating
09/09/2019, 20:29 - Bee: Do you like popcorn?
09/09/2019, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: In the moment I'm eating it yes. But sometimes it's stuck between your teeth and then it's the worst food I've ever eaten
09/09/2019, 20:31 - Bee: What's your favorite flavor?
09/09/2019, 20:31 - Bee: That's why we have toothbrushes and floss
09/09/2019, 20:31 - Bee: So that we can eat sticky popcorn
09/09/2019, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: Currently cheese and caramel
09/09/2019, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: Don't have those in the theatre where I'm eating
09/09/2019, 20:32 - Bee: Oh there
09/09/2019, 20:32 - Bee: Okay
09/09/2019, 20:33 - Bee: Now that your bags are packed and the waves are coming closer, is there anything you wish to do before you leave?
09/09/2019, 20:35 - Nischal Abraham: Not really... There's things for which I was staying longer, but nothing left undone as such
09/09/2019, 20:36 - Bee: Oh good. So no regrets
09/09/2019, 20:36 - Nischal Abraham: So I say while my to do list is less than 50% done
09/09/2019, 20:36 - Bee: 😂
09/09/2019, 20:37 - Bee: Did you write a song?
09/09/2019, 20:37 - Nischal Abraham: No song, no cake. And all of a sudden no time to do anything either
09/09/2019, 20:37 - Bee: Pull request?
09/09/2019, 20:37 - Bee: Whatever that is.
09/09/2019, 20:38 - Nischal Abraham: You know what... I think it's more towards 80% undone
09/09/2019, 20:38 - Bee: 😂
09/09/2019, 20:38 - Bee: Oh Nischal
09/09/2019, 20:39 - Bee: Do you remember that conversation from Cafe amigos in estate when Janice was there
09/09/2019, 20:39 - Nischal Abraham: I wish it were more... I'm terrible at completing stuff 😞
09/09/2019, 20:40 - Bee: Oh!!! Funny thing but I just remembered. I was a tiny bit uncomfortable when I realised Janice was staying at your place. Because isn't that how Josh and Janelle fell in love?!
09/09/2019, 20:41 - Bee: That wasn't what I wanted to mention though
09/09/2019, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: What!!?
09/09/2019, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
09/09/2019, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't know about Josh and Janelle(is that how it's spelt)
09/09/2019, 20:42 - Bee: About 1 Cor 13 and how we can substitute the world Love/charity with the name of our crush
09/09/2019, 20:42 - Bee: It is
09/09/2019, 20:42 - Bee: They first noticed and began liking each other when she came here for a couple days and stayed with them
09/09/2019, 20:43 - Bee: I had done that with your name just the night before. And I shared it with Reenee. And so it was on the top of our tongues
09/09/2019, 20:43 - Bee: 😶
09/09/2019, 20:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I remember. What about it?
09/09/2019, 20:43 - Bee: Word*.
09/09/2019, 20:43 - Bee: Tip*
09/09/2019, 20:43 - Bee: What is happening?!???
09/09/2019, 20:44 - Nischal Abraham: This is why messages are confusing 🤣
09/09/2019, 20:44 - Bee: Especially when you're messaging meeeee
09/09/2019, 20:44 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't read this. Okay that's a lot of pressure
09/09/2019, 20:45 - Bee: No. It fit. I'm not saying you're perfect or anything
09/09/2019, 20:45 - Bee: But it fit!!
09/09/2019, 20:46 - Nischal Abraham: I really feel blessed that you think so
09/09/2019, 20:47 - Bee: :)
09/09/2019, 20:47 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know if it's because it's so late... But you're tugging on heart strings right now
09/09/2019, 20:48 - Bee: I can tug on your heart strings all day
09/09/2019, 20:48 - Bee: No I think chatting becomes different after 1am
09/09/2019, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: According to HIMYM it's 2 am
09/09/2019, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: Though the quote in that was nothing good happens after 2am
09/09/2019, 20:52 - Bee: I finish my assignments after 2am
09/09/2019, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: Well they were talking about 2am US time
09/09/2019, 20:53 - Nischal Abraham: What do you do till 2am?
09/09/2019, 20:53 - Bee: I sleep until 12 and then waste time until 1 and then finally get to work
09/09/2019, 20:54 - Bee: But I'm trying to change my sleep habits...one of the main reasons I left the hostel was that I was missing the weekly meetings. But I'm still missing the weekly meetings
09/09/2019, 20:55 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Isn't hospital duty the reason you're missing the weekly meetings?
09/09/2019, 20:56 - Bee: Kinda... because I'm too tired and I go to sleep
09/09/2019, 20:56 - Bee: But I can make it if I really want to and ask God to help me
09/09/2019, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I understand the struggle... I guess I failed for the longest time because I wanted to
09/09/2019, 20:57 - Bee: Which I'm trying to do now.
09/09/2019, 20:58 - Bee: Most of the meeting days I wouldn't even do anything productive until 9pm sitting at home
09/09/2019, 20:58 - Nischal Abraham: That's good! It's never too late to change things for the better
09/09/2019, 20:58 - Nischal Abraham: Debby
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm falling asleep now
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Bee: Are you going to sleep?
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: 😊
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Bee: Okay
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: I wish I could talk to you forever
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Bee: Thank you for staying up so long
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Bee: ☺🤗
09/09/2019, 20:59 - Bee: Go sleep
09/09/2019, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: I enjoyed this... My heart feels full y'know
09/09/2019, 21:00 - Bee: My heart feels full too. And my eyes as well.
09/09/2019, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: Eyes full of sleep?
09/09/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Nope.
09/09/2019, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: Aww
09/09/2019, 21:01 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
09/09/2019, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I'll be praying for your day. Change some lives :)
09/09/2019, 21:02 - Bee: I'll try.
09/09/2019, 21:02 - Bee: Praying for and about you. Bye!
10/09/2019, 02:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/09/2019, 04:37 - Nischal Abraham: On Samuel's shoulder?
10/09/2019, 05:24 - Bee: The other one yaaa
10/09/2019, 06:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry if you took offence to that. I assure you it was entirely platonic
10/09/2019, 06:02 - Nischal Abraham: (not really... I always hesitate for a second whenever I made a choice to do an action
10/09/2019, 06:04 - Bee: No no why are you apologising
10/09/2019, 06:04 - Bee: I didn't take offence
10/09/2019, 06:04 - Bee: I was going through old photos and noticed this
10/09/2019, 06:10 - Nischal Abraham: You seem to have a lot of time at hand... Today is clearing out day at home. My cupboard is being emptied out
10/09/2019, 06:20 - Bee: Yes I'm running out of things to do in the train
10/09/2019, 06:25 - Nischal Abraham: Going so late?
10/09/2019, 06:26 - Bee: No?
10/09/2019, 06:27 - Bee: Oh that was in the morning
10/09/2019, 06:27 - Bee: On my way to the hospital
10/09/2019, 06:27 - Bee: How are you feeling?
10/09/2019, 06:29 - Nischal Abraham: Don't you usually start much earlier in the hospital?
10/09/2019, 06:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'm feeling conflicted. There's so many memories to my clothes and it seems like such a big decision to throw them away 😭
10/09/2019, 06:59 - Bee: My duty begins at 8. I'm usually here by 7:40
10/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: Aww Nischal
10/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: :(
10/09/2019, 07:08 - Bee: Do they still fit you? Or are they very old?
10/09/2019, 07:09 - Bee: You're gonna make new memories
10/09/2019, 07:09 - Bee: In a new country!!
10/09/2019, 07:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yep new memories is what I told myself as I dumped them. Don't worry one t-shirt is kept aside for you... I highly doubt you could ever wear it though... Nidhi hates that my size is smaller than hers
10/09/2019, 07:34 - Bee: I was going to remind you but then I thought no, Nischal would remember
10/09/2019, 07:34 - Bee: Haven't you left for lunch yet?
10/09/2019, 07:34 - Bee: Why can't I wear it?
10/09/2019, 07:35 - Bee: I hope and pray you have a memorable time at Siby Aunty's :)
10/09/2019, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: Just came back from there... Didn't do much... Just had lunch and talked a bit but lunch was nice 😋
10/09/2019, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: You might not be able to wear it cause it might be small for you? I don't know maybe you'll fit into it. It's a men's medium
10/09/2019, 12:19 - Bee: Yup it'll fit
10/09/2019, 12:19 - Bee: Foooooooooooood!! 😋
10/09/2019, 12:20 - Bee: I'm posted in the operation theatre this week
10/09/2019, 12:21 - Bee: After the baby is born, we clean them up a bit and show the baby to the husband and relatives outside
10/09/2019, 12:21 - Bee: I got to do that today. And their faces just lit up looking at the baby!! I almost cried
10/09/2019, 12:21 - Bee: It was beautiful
10/09/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Wow. Just reading it sounds beautiful. It's amazing you get to see that experience so often!
10/09/2019, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: How involved are you allowed to be in the theatre as a nursing student?
10/09/2019, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Give me a call when and if you're free after reading this
10/09/2019, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: I did say if you're free :P
10/09/2019, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: We got busy with packing stuff and I couldn't make it for the prayer meeting
10/09/2019, 16:20 - Bee: Hi
10/09/2019, 16:21 - Bee: Reenee and I made plans with Sujata di
10/09/2019, 16:21 - Bee: I didn't think you would be free
10/09/2019, 16:21 - Bee: It will be too late after right?
10/09/2019, 16:21 - Bee: :P
10/09/2019, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: Not too late. Never too late... You guys have fun! We'll chat after you're done :)
10/09/2019, 16:30 - Bee: Okay. :)
10/09/2019, 17:54 - Bee: HI!!
10/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: We're allowed to assist in surgeries. Just like the staff nurses. That was a requirement in second year when I had my OT posting for the first time
10/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Is there a lot remaining?
10/09/2019, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: It's almost done. Just the odd box and charger to be pushed in last minute left. Everything's gone
10/09/2019, 18:23 - Bee: :'(
10/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... The mood of the house be slowly shifting... Nidhi's already gotten quieter. And it's not just her submissions that caused it
10/09/2019, 18:24 - Bee: She's had to say goodbye to so many brothers already
10/09/2019, 18:25 - Bee: I think you're her favorite one though
10/09/2019, 18:25 - Bee: The way she talks about you
10/09/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Is it possible to talk on a call? If not that's fine too
11/09/2019, 04:13 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! I hope I didn't leave you sleepy in the hospital today. I realised I wasn't sleepy at night because I'd slept in the afternoon
11/09/2019, 04:58 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
11/09/2019, 04:59 - Bee: I drank coffee so I'm fine
11/09/2019, 05:00 - Bee: I'm craving sadhya
11/09/2019, 05:32 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... If you find a mallu restaurant somewhere you might just get it
11/09/2019, 05:48 - Bee: Yes we'll try to arrange something for lunch 😋
11/09/2019, 06:15 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds nice... I should head out too and finish up all my work for today
11/09/2019, 08:50 - Bee: Sadhya is on its way. :D 😋
11/09/2019, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: My mouth is watering just thinking about it 😌. Or maybe I'm just hungry in general...
11/09/2019, 10:56 - Bee: Did you have lunch?
11/09/2019, 10:56 - Bee: Outside?
11/09/2019, 10:56 - Bee: It was yum! 😌
11/09/2019, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: No I haven't had lunch. I thought about eating out but I didn't want to risk it so close to leaving
11/09/2019, 10:57 - Bee: You must be famished then
11/09/2019, 10:57 - Bee: How long until you reach home?
11/09/2019, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: Should be another 30-40 min. I reached Thane
11/09/2019, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: It's fine. I've had late lunches before. I've been overeating these last 2 days anyway so a bit of fasting will do me good 😁
11/09/2019, 11:00 - Bee: 😂
11/09/2019, 11:00 - Bee: But you don't have any weight to lose
11/09/2019, 11:00 - Bee: I lost weight. I checked today morning
11/09/2019, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly... So I won't lose them
11/09/2019, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! You should be eating less popcorn and more food Debby 😑
11/09/2019, 11:03 - Bee: 😂
11/09/2019, 11:03 - Bee: I'll try
11/09/2019, 11:03 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm sure the sadhya helped balance things out now 😂
11/09/2019, 11:04 - Nischal Abraham: Did you go out somewhere or ordered it?
11/09/2019, 11:04 - Bee: 😂 it did. I feel like I've gained weight with just one meal
11/09/2019, 11:04 - Bee: We ordered. Not allowed to leave the hospital while on duty
11/09/2019, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Like people always tell me... Eat what you can while you don't have to worry about your weight
11/09/2019, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: I've already braced myself for my metabolism to slow down
11/09/2019, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: But I haven't really done anything about it yet
11/09/2019, 11:07 - Bee: That's correct
11/09/2019, 11:07 - Bee: I know mine has slowed down
11/09/2019, 11:07 - Bee: Ditto. I will though. Once it's too late.
11/09/2019, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: Is that why you're still losing weight instead of gaining it? 😂
11/09/2019, 11:09 - Bee: Heyyyyy
11/09/2019, 11:09 - Bee: That was the popcorn
11/09/2019, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: So popcorn makes you lose weight?
11/09/2019, 11:11 - Bee: If that's what's for dinner then yes
11/09/2019, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: HOLD UP. Is that ALL you had for dinner!?
11/09/2019, 11:13 - Bee: No. Don't be silly. I had pani Puri as well
11/09/2019, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!! 🤣
11/09/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Just once in a while
11/09/2019, 11:13 - Bee: I don't do this all the time!!
11/09/2019, 11:14 - Bee: Why am I feeling guilty
11/09/2019, 11:14 - Bee: 😒
11/09/2019, 11:14 - Bee: Nischal!!!
11/09/2019, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay. I know you'll make the right decisions when you need to
11/09/2019, 11:14 - Bee: No no you're making it worse. :P
11/09/2019, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
11/09/2019, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just shut up about it then. I'm sorry for making you feel bad
11/09/2019, 11:15 - Bee: What?! No!!!
11/09/2019, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: It's like you said... It's only once in a while right. That's fine... It's a lot better than skipping meals
11/09/2019, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: I used to skip dinners and that made me lose weight
11/09/2019, 11:17 - Bee: Believe me, it is.
11/09/2019, 11:17 - Bee: I did that a lot in the third year because I would be exhausted and wake up only the next morning
11/09/2019, 11:18 - Bee: I'm praying hard for a holiday tomorrow
11/09/2019, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: Same! Except I did it while I was working. And I'd rather just sleep than eat
11/09/2019, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: And it got to a point where I knew I was weaker because of it... But I had no inclination to eat at night... And I had to eventually force myself to slowly get back into the habit of dinner
11/09/2019, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying you get a holiday too
11/09/2019, 11:37 - Bee: Please do
11/09/2019, 11:38 - Bee: There's an important person I want to meet
11/09/2019, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'm home!
11/09/2019, 12:02 - Bee: I think that was the time you got to travel in a local
11/09/2019, 12:02 - Bee: Last*
11/09/2019, 12:03 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you get to meet your important person
11/09/2019, 12:03 - Nischal Abraham: Good riddance 😂. Some things I can do without
11/09/2019, 12:03 - Bee: Yes. My dentist's appointment will go waste otherwise
11/09/2019, 12:03 - Bee: Jk.
11/09/2019, 12:03 - Bee: You'll miss it one day
11/09/2019, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Why would you take an appointment when you don't know if you have a holiday?
11/09/2019, 12:04 - Bee: Clearly I didn't think this through.
11/09/2019, 12:04 - Bee: Nischal-1, Debby-
11/09/2019, 12:04 - Bee: -0*
11/09/2019, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: I don't keep score even for football... And you'd clearly be winning for all the dumb things I haven't thought through 😅
11/09/2019, 12:11 - Bee: 😂.
Well...
11/09/2019, 12:11 - Bee: You get another point
11/09/2019, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: When do you find out tomorrow is not a holiday?
11/09/2019, 13:43 - Bee: I don't have a holiday. I'm hoping for a notif which says otherwise.
11/09/2019, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: And when's the latest that'll be known?
11/09/2019, 14:13 - Bee: I should know by 10pm
11/09/2019, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: So how was your day today? I managed to finish all the items on my shopping list :)
11/09/2019, 14:32 - Bee: That's good!! So nothing else to be bought before you leave right?
11/09/2019, 14:33 - Bee: My day was uneventful...
11/09/2019, 14:33 - Bee: The same old routine
11/09/2019, 14:50 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing else to be bought. Only things to be given
11/09/2019, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Your routine includes birthing mothers and babies! To me that's an event no matter how many times you see it
11/09/2019, 14:58 - Bee: Yeah. I guess I'm losing the wonder if it all. :(
11/09/2019, 14:58 - Bee: Of*
11/09/2019, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have Alfred aunty's number?
11/09/2019, 14:59 - Bee: Patti Home.vcf (file attached)
11/09/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debs.
11/09/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: It's looking like there's a possibility we might not come for the Bible study
11/09/2019, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: Because of the visarjan. There may be too much traffic to come
11/09/2019, 15:03 - Bee: Oh
11/09/2019, 15:03 - Bee: So I can't come there either
11/09/2019, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: I mean we'll finally see tomorrow how the situation is
11/09/2019, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Just a possibility
11/09/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm planning on taking a Auto and just leaving early so I can reach on time? But then there's dinner after @Linnet's
11/09/2019, 15:08 - Bee: It's okay. You must be feeling and thinking a lot of things... Please don't let this be another worry
11/09/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: But I want to meet you... And I thought if nothing else at least Thursday Bible Study is there
11/09/2019, 15:09 - Bee: If you're coming for the Bible study alone, will you come a few minutes early?
11/09/2019, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll try to come waaay earlier. If delays are happening then better early than late
11/09/2019, 15:10 - Bee: Okay. :)
I hope I'll see you tomorrow then
11/09/2019, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Debby... I'm low-key freaking out. And we're heading for dinner to Juliet aunty's place now
11/09/2019, 15:11 - Bee: Freaking out about what? Leaving in two days?
11/09/2019, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Freaking out about the possibility that I won't see you at least once before I go 😖
11/09/2019, 15:12 - Bee: We'll meet. Promise. If not tomorrow, I'll come say goodbye on Friday. I'll drag Ashley Reenee and Arpitha so it's not weird.
11/09/2019, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: There's you guys can barge in. I think Joji uncle and Ranjit uncle family will be coming home to pray in the evening
11/09/2019, 15:13 - Bee: Please don't freak out
11/09/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Yes you'll see be before you go.
11/09/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Me*
11/09/2019, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'll try not to. It's a lowkey freakout so no one will notice... Just me slightly distracted in conversation
11/09/2019, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Which is what I am all the time so no difference there
11/09/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Oh Nischal
11/09/2019, 15:16 - Bee: Go be in the moment. Eat some extra food for me. Since I had just popcorn for dinner. I'll be here after you're done. :).
11/09/2019, 15:16 - Bee: Popcorn for dinner last night. Proper dinner tonight. Bye.
11/09/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad it's proper dinner tonight 😊. That calms me down a bit
11/09/2019, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: I ate plenty... So full ☺
11/09/2019, 18:25 - Bee: Hey. :)
11/09/2019, 18:25 - Bee: I did too!
11/09/2019, 18:25 - Bee: https://youtu.be/ubjNcxyAxjA
11/09/2019, 18:26 - Bee: The families in the video are real
11/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: The mum in the second family recently passed away because of cancer
11/09/2019, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'll check it out. Just heading out running an errand now
11/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Take your time
11/09/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Finally home. Have you watched a movie called "Dirty Dancing"?
11/09/2019, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: That was beautiful. I didn't realise it was part of a music video till it ended. And since you mentioned it was real families I was expecting a documentary. But this is just as precious
11/09/2019, 18:57 - Bee: I have. What about it?
11/09/2019, 18:57 - Bee: Yeah :). The song is pretty good too
11/09/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/_9Kpte-GTVU
11/09/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Ignore the movie... My mind shifted to this artist now. The lyrics are amazing
11/09/2019, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: How long have you been hearing her songs?
11/09/2019, 19:01 - Bee: It's been more than a year
11/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Reminds me of Josh Wilson... In a different way
11/09/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Well I've only heard two songs so far so who am I to make the comparison
11/09/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: How come you're still awake tho?
11/09/2019, 19:06 - Bee: Listening to this for the first time
11/09/2019, 19:06 - Bee: I love the lyrics
11/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: You are the reason
11/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: Have you heard that one btw?
11/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: That reminds me
11/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/09/2019, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣
11/09/2019, 19:08 - Bee: I'm gonna use that
11/09/2019, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Which one?
11/09/2019, 19:09 - Bee: .
11/09/2019, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's the song!? I thought you were mentioning the because
11/09/2019, 19:10 - Bee: No they are all different things. Sorry if you're confused
11/09/2019, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Not confused... Just clarifying. I'm already listening to it
11/09/2019, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think I've heard it before
11/09/2019, 19:10 - Bee: Oh
11/09/2019, 19:11 - Bee: The one by Callum Scott
11/09/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Hearing it for the first time... Reminds me of All of Me
11/09/2019, 19:12 - Bee: Oh that's a good one too. But too many people made too many covers of that one
11/09/2019, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Mainstream songs have that dilemma. It's a sweet love song btw. You is the because
11/09/2019, 19:14 - Bee: 😂
11/09/2019, 19:14 - Bee: It is
11/09/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Don't
11/09/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Stop
11/09/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Believing
11/09/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Hold on
11/09/2019, 19:16 - Bee: That's what I'll saying as you leave
11/09/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Sing* oh no
11/09/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
11/09/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I appreciate the sentiment
11/09/2019, 19:17 - Bee: 😂. Thanks
11/09/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: You have to go tomorrow?
11/09/2019, 19:17 - Bee: Yes.
11/09/2019, 19:17 - Bee: :(
11/09/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay. Make the most of it. God needs you in the hospital more than at home
11/09/2019, 19:18 - Bee: I thought of taking leave. But that didn't feel right
11/09/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: What're your reasons?
11/09/2019, 19:18 - Bee: For taking leave?
11/09/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
11/09/2019, 19:19 - Bee: So that I can spend time with you
11/09/2019, 19:19 - Bee: I'm not saying this didn't feel right
11/09/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: I understand. I wouldn't want you to take a leave just for me
11/09/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Even though I'd love for it to happen
11/09/2019, 19:20 - Bee: Yeah?
11/09/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Of course... Why the question?
11/09/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: But don't. If you don't feel right with it then you shouldn't
11/09/2019, 19:22 - Bee: Yeah... Thank you. Because I will stay off you ask me to.
11/09/2019, 19:22 - Bee: If* sorry
11/09/2019, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Then I'm not asking you to. In fact I'll ask that you go. If we're faithful in the little things, God is faithful in all the bigger things
11/09/2019, 19:24 - Bee: Can I call you?
12/09/2019, 03:14 - Bee: Hey. I hope you have a great day today. And that you get to finish the ICICI work
12/09/2019, 03:14 - Bee: Praying for you.
12/09/2019, 04:11 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby. I've been praying for you too! Remember there are no accidents or coincidences when we have an Almighty God lighting our ways for us
12/09/2019, 04:12 - Nischal Abraham: This was what I was lead to meditate on today

Ecc 5:4-7 NET 4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay in paying it. For God takes no pleasure in fools: Pay what you vow! 5 It is better for you not to vow than to vow and not pay it. 6 Do not let your mouth cause you to sin, and do not tell the priest, “It was a mistake!” Why make God angry at you so that he would destroy the work of your hands?” 7 Just as there is futility in many dreams, so also in many words. Therefore, fear God!
12/09/2019, 04:14 - Nischal Abraham: The whole book of Ecclesiastes feels like a reality check 😶. Have a wonderful day ahead!! I pray you find something delightful and wonderful at work today too 😊
12/09/2019, 04:43 - Bee: Thank you for this passage. I've been oddly peaceful since morning. I know it's all God. I know we made the right decision...even though it may seem insignificant
12/09/2019, 04:45 - Bee: I had a wonderful time of worship in the train this morning...it was refreshing
12/09/2019, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like I'll be able to cross off another item on my list. Gospel songs will officially be someone else's privilege to bear
12/09/2019, 11:52 - Bee: What was the item? Finding someone to hand it over?
12/09/2019, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: No it was compiling the gospel slides into one ppt so that it's easier to use
12/09/2019, 12:27 - Bee: :)
12/09/2019, 12:28 - Bee: It's encouraging to see how God used you for everything music and gospel related.
12/09/2019, 12:28 - Bee: I'm thankful to God for that.
12/09/2019, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: I'm thankful to God for that too 😌. Using my weaknesses for His glory
12/09/2019, 12:39 - Bee: :)
12/09/2019, 12:39 - Bee: I should reach vasant vihar by 6
12/09/2019, 12:40 - Bee: No not 6
12/09/2019, 12:40 - Bee: 6:10-15ish.
12/09/2019, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I'll see you then
12/09/2019, 12:43 - Bee: Okay
12/09/2019, 13:21 - Bee: Hey
12/09/2019, 13:21 - Bee: Is the park near Bethany okay?
12/09/2019, 13:21 - Bee: I'll get down there
12/09/2019, 13:22 - Bee: Or Meadows?
12/09/2019, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: Meadows
12/09/2019, 13:30 - Bee: Okay
12/09/2019, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: You'll have to walk to the park near Bethany anyway... But primarily because I already reached Meadows 😅
12/09/2019, 13:31 - Bee: Oh you've reached
12/09/2019, 13:31 - Bee: I'll take 12 minutes. According to Maps.
12/09/2019, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. I always end up overestimating my travel time
12/09/2019, 13:34 - Bee: And now you'll have to wait
12/09/2019, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. I have the rains to keep me company
12/09/2019, 13:35 - Bee: 😂
12/09/2019, 13:35 - Bee: But it's not raining
12/09/2019, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: It's drizzling here
12/09/2019, 13:35 - Bee: Oh
12/09/2019, 13:36 - Bee: I'm near 1441 and there's nothing
12/09/2019, 13:36 - Bee: 😶
12/09/2019, 13:36 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. Small clouds
12/09/2019, 13:36 - Bee: Very small
12/09/2019, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it's gone
12/09/2019, 16:48 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/09/2019, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: We look exhausted 😮
12/09/2019, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it's the lighting
12/09/2019, 18:02 - Bee: Must be the lighting
12/09/2019, 18:02 - Bee: But I am exhausted. Off to bed
12/09/2019, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! Thank you for meeting up today
12/09/2019, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be meeting Ankush after dinner
12/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Thank you for taking some time out
12/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Yes!! Have fun! :)
12/09/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
13/09/2019, 03:44 - Bee: Good morning. :)
13/09/2019, 03:45 - Bee: I started reading the book of Esther...
13/09/2019, 03:45 - Bee: And I didn't cover much because the first few verses stood out to me
13/09/2019, 03:46 - Bee: About how King Ahasuerus showed off his riches and glory for 180 days (isn't that a lot?!?!). God pointed out my sin and pride and how I'm like Ahasuerus in many ways
13/09/2019, 03:47 - Bee: Trying to show off my talents or skills in the most inconspicuous ways possible
13/09/2019, 03:50 - Bee: "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,  but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
Matthew 6:19‭-‬21 ESV
https://bible.com/bible/59/mat.6.19-21.ESV
13/09/2019, 03:50 - Bee: Then I read this passage
13/09/2019, 04:10 - Bee: I hope you have a wonderful day. :)
13/09/2019, 05:00 - Nischal Abraham: 180 days is a lot... Imagine partying for 6 months. It's a conscious decision to acknowledge God's hand working in our successes and talents. And such an easy place to take pride in our own efforts and abilities
13/09/2019, 05:02 - Nischal Abraham: I love this verse. Makes me feel guilty for some reason every time I read it 😅
13/09/2019, 05:02 - Nischal Abraham: I pray you enjoy your day as well ☺
13/09/2019, 06:37 - Bee: Where are your treasures 🤔
13/09/2019, 06:37 - Bee: Btw, I wore my boyfriend's t-shirt today
13/09/2019, 07:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'm learning to lay up treasures in heaven. It used to be my guitar to a large extent... Now it happens to be the person I'm talking to
13/09/2019, 07:08 - Nischal Abraham: Aww you're making me blush. But how can you miss me already, we just met yesterday
13/09/2019, 07:36 - Bee: Could you explain, please?
13/09/2019, 07:36 - Bee: I didn't want yesterday to get over. One way was to wear your t-shirt. So that's what I did
13/09/2019, 07:48 - Nischal Abraham: I mean there was a time I was overly concerned about who handled my guitar. And I'd get really upset if anything happened to it. I'd get upset at the people who mishandled it
13/09/2019, 07:50 - Bee: Oh
13/09/2019, 07:50 - Nischal Abraham: Well over time I've withdrawn that attachment. It is an instrument and it's meant to be used... But if I'm honest the things I spend waay too much time doing is wasting time
13/09/2019, 07:50 - Bee: Is that why you never let me carry your guitar?
13/09/2019, 07:50 - Bee: Jk.
13/09/2019, 07:51 - Nischal Abraham: Did I prevent you from carrying it? I'm sorry. These days I let everyone carry it
13/09/2019, 07:51 - Bee: I used to be very protective of the gifts I've received. I never let anyone touch them
13/09/2019, 07:52 - Bee: I realized I was wrong to do that
13/09/2019, 07:52 - Bee: Once or twice maybe. No big deal
13/09/2019, 07:53 - Bee: Also, before I forget
Is it okay if Ashley, Reenee, Arpitha, and I drop by in the evening for a few minutes? Just to say bye. I'm not sure about Ashley yet because he may come home late from work
13/09/2019, 07:53 - Bee: You were typing
13/09/2019, 07:53 - Bee: Will you be getting a few hours of sleep before you leave?
13/09/2019, 07:53 - Nischal Abraham: Oh the treks!! I didn't let you carry it cause I didn't want to burden you with the weight...
13/09/2019, 07:54 - Bee: But you had to carry it on your own!!! I just wanted to make it a little easier.
13/09/2019, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to have you guys over 😊. Probable won't be sleeping till I'm on the plane... Or maybe I'll take a nap in the afternoon so I don't feel sleepy at night
13/09/2019, 07:55 - Bee: :). I'll see you in the evening then
13/09/2019, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: Don't mind me if I cry
13/09/2019, 07:56 - Bee: I may not be able to see you cry because of the tears in my eyes
13/09/2019, 07:56 - Bee: So we're cool.
13/09/2019, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: There's others who are coming as well to pray. Don't worry about it, you can drop by whenever you're free. I'm just letting you know
13/09/2019, 07:57 - Bee: Thanks for the heads up. I'll let you know when we're coming
13/09/2019, 13:50 - Bee: Hey. I'm praying for you. You don't have to reply. I'll see you in a couple of hours.
13/09/2019, 14:54 - Bee: Rolf is joining as well. And he'll be a little late. So we'll all be there around 8:50
13/09/2019, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. No problem about the time. I'll be awake 😋
13/09/2019, 15:23 - Bee: Okay. Did you get any sleep?
13/09/2019, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: No... I was still sorting out packing stuff
13/09/2019, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: It's fine... I'll have plenty of time to sleep later
13/09/2019, 15:56 - Bee: So Rolf still hasn't reached. We're waiting for him
13/09/2019, 15:56 - Bee: And Ravi uncle and papa want to join as well
13/09/2019, 15:56 - Bee: All done?
13/09/2019, 15:57 - Bee: Trimmer? Charger?
13/09/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Phone charger is last item on the packing list
13/09/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Everything else is done... I was kicking out all the non-essentials
13/09/2019, 15:58 - Bee: Crossed 30 kilos?
13/09/2019, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Crossed 40 kilos
13/09/2019, 16:01 - Bee: Ouch
13/09/2019, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: I can carry 40 btw. So it's just a little adjustment
13/09/2019, 16:05 - Bee: Oh. I thought it's 30
13/09/2019, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Student privileges 😁
13/09/2019, 16:06 - Bee: Ahh
13/09/2019, 16:06 - Bee: You're a good boy
13/09/2019, 16:08 - Bee: A really really really really good boy.
13/09/2019, 16:08 - Bee: I might be biased though. Or maybe not.
13/09/2019, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: You're biased
13/09/2019, 16:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/09/2019, 17:00 - Bee: We left. Will be there in 15
13/09/2019, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! See you here
13/09/2019, 20:45 - Bee: Nischal
13/09/2019, 21:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's happening
13/09/2019, 21:57 - Nischal Abraham: I'm at check-in now and the line is sooooo long. Well I expect you'll see all this in the morning :)
13/09/2019, 23:05 - Bee: Hey
13/09/2019, 23:05 - Bee: It's happening. Too bittersweet
13/09/2019, 23:09 - Bee: Deuteronomy 31:8 English Standard Version (ESV)
8 It is the Lord who goes before you. He will be with you; he will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”
13/09/2019, 23:10 - Bee: Praying for you continually.
13/09/2019, 23:12 - Bee: If you have time to kill and want to talk then call me. I'll be asleep and you may have to call more than once (I'm a deep sleeper) but do not hesitate. I have a holiday tomorrow.
13/09/2019, 23:19 - Bee: I'm deeply saddened that you're leaving. But there's no unrest. I'm feeling so peaceful. It's definitely the peace that passes all understanding.
13/09/2019, 23:19 - Bee: Keep praying, okay?
13/09/2019, 23:20 - Bee: There's no time difference when it comes to God!
13/09/2019, 23:20 - Bee: That was my attempt at being funny.
13/09/2019, 23:22 - Bee: ‼:)
14/09/2019, 00:24 - Nischal Abraham: Quick update. I'm on the plane! God is working miracles every step of the way... I'll give you details when I'm waiting at Abu Dhabi. 
(You're successful at being funny, but maybe I'm being biased)
Well I'll be offline now! Your prayers keep me going ☺
14/09/2019, 04:27 - Nischal Abraham: The plane has landed in Abu Dhabi
14/09/2019, 04:29 - Nischal Abraham: Next flight is at 9:45. Boarding is an hour earlier. I just spent the whole flight sleeping 😂
14/09/2019, 04:33 - Bee: Hi Nischal!!! ☺
14/09/2019, 04:34 - Bee: You're biased. How was the plane ride? Good you got to sleep. :) Tell be about the miracles when you get time
14/09/2019, 04:35 - Bee: Yesterday evening we were told we have a holiday today. But I'll be working tomorrow... We have to participate in a pulse polio campaign which is always on Sundays
14/09/2019, 05:07 - Nischal Abraham: Plane ride went by without any issues... They had onboard entertainment movies... But I was so sleepy I just kept going in and out of deep sleep
14/09/2019, 05:07 - Nischal Abraham: I remember eating some breakfast... And when I snoozed and got up the plate was gone and I didn't even notice 🙈
14/09/2019, 05:10 - Nischal Abraham: So is holiday today compensation for having to go tomorrow? What is pulse polio btw?
14/09/2019, 05:26 - Bee: 😂 you're well rested. Hope your neck is alright.
14/09/2019, 05:28 - Bee: It's a vaccination campaign.. for polio. It's usually in a public place so I think it'll be somewhere near sanpada station
14/09/2019, 05:31 - Bee: Is anyone picking you up from the airport?
14/09/2019, 05:36 - Nischal Abraham: Mr. Cherian Varkey will be meeting me at the airport. He knows the address of my residence so he'll be taking me straight there
14/09/2019, 05:36 - Bee: Oh! The uncle who was in Fort?
14/09/2019, 05:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep that guy
14/09/2019, 05:38 - Nischal Abraham: I remember polio vaccination centres... It's a place that makes babies cry 😶. I know it's for their own good but I still remember how that medicine smells and stings
14/09/2019, 05:38 - Bee: What?! Polio vaccines are oral drops. Not injections...
14/09/2019, 05:38 - Bee: I don't remember crying
14/09/2019, 05:39 - Bee: And it's sweet! I remember wanting to take the vaccine even when I didn't need it anymore
14/09/2019, 05:39 - Nischal Abraham: I know!! And they still sting... It's like having alcohol... Only you're a baby
14/09/2019, 05:39 - Bee: :P
14/09/2019, 05:39 - Bee: 😶
14/09/2019, 05:39 - Bee: 😂
14/09/2019, 05:39 - Nischal Abraham: I don't remember it being sweet at all :/
14/09/2019, 05:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not particularly fond of any hospital smell for that matter so maybe I'm just making up bad memories 😂
14/09/2019, 05:42 - Nischal Abraham: Well anyway go on and live your day! I'll try and call later. 
Today's quiet time led me to Colossians 2. I'm concerned about choosing a church to fellowship with and this really comforted me
14/09/2019, 05:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be boarding now. Talk to you in 8 hoursish :)
14/09/2019, 05:47 - Bee: Okay. I'll be here.
14/09/2019, 05:47 - Bee: Praying for your flight.
14/09/2019, 05:47 - Bee: :)
14/09/2019, 06:47 - Bee: I'm making a list of all the things I need to do today. And I'll tell you after you land whether I completed anything or not. I don't want this holiday to go waste
14/09/2019, 06:48 - Bee: 😂. I love the sterile smell of hospitals. 🙈
14/09/2019, 06:50 - Bee: God will honor you because of this desire and burden you have to find fellowship.
14/09/2019, 11:10 - Bee: I cooked!! 😭
14/09/2019, 11:31 - Bee: 2 hours until you set your foot in the place you're gonna call home
14/09/2019, 11:31 - Bee: 2 hours!!!!!!!!!
14/09/2019, 11:31 - Bee: I'm so so excited for you, Nischal!! 🤗☺
14/09/2019, 11:36 - Bee: NEW COUNTRY!!!!!!!!!!
14/09/2019, 11:36 - Bee: A beautiful one!!!!!!!
14/09/2019, 11:36 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!!
14/09/2019, 11:40 - Bee: God is so good. So so good.
14/09/2019, 11:43 - Bee: Sorry for blowing up your phone but I can't stop!!!
14/09/2019, 11:43 - Bee: NISCHAL!!
14/09/2019, 11:43 - Bee: I don't think I'll get tired of this
14/09/2019, 11:44 - Bee: Praying for Mr. Varkey. Thanking God for him and every stranger who's been kind to you
14/09/2019, 11:44 - Bee: Ireland!!!!!!
14/09/2019, 11:44 - Bee: Hahaha. Done. For a while though.
14/09/2019, 12:05 - Bee: 3 hours right?
14/09/2019, 12:05 - Bee: But now 2 and a half.
14/09/2019, 12:06 - Bee: YAY!
14/09/2019, 12:28 - Bee: IT IS TIME
(The next country part of it) not really 'next' country now though
14/09/2019, 12:48 - Bee: 2 hours!!!
14/09/2019, 13:43 - Bee: 1 hour. ☺
14/09/2019, 13:43 - Bee: You're a wonderful person.
14/09/2019, 14:48 - Bee: Dearest Nischal, it begins!!
14/09/2019, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: I'm here
14/09/2019, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: But that's a lot of messages. In line for immigration check I'll message proper once I'm settled in
14/09/2019, 15:44 - Bee: No hurry.
14/09/2019, 22:22 - Nischal Abraham: So it took a while to settle in. I don't think I'm still settled in really. And now the tiredness of travelling is hitting me. Details will follow soon... I didn't realise there's so many things to be set up
14/09/2019, 22:25 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
15/09/2019, 02:37 - Bee: I imagine 'Mr. Cherian Varkey' to be an old man. My bad
15/09/2019, 02:37 - Bee: Imagined*
15/09/2019, 02:38 - Bee: They are really cute!
15/09/2019, 02:40 - Bee: Are you at their place? Or your residence?
15/09/2019, 07:30 - Nischal Abraham: My residence in Kilcock. They stay 40-45 min away from here
15/09/2019, 07:30 - Nischal Abraham: But they've offered to take me along for worship this morning. So we'll be leaving by 9 am local time
15/09/2019, 07:31 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done with meeting?
15/09/2019, 07:31 - Bee: I couldn't going today because of the polio campaign. I'm bummed that I missed worship. :(
I hope I'm back in time for the gospel meeting
15/09/2019, 07:31 - Bee: Go* 🤦🏻‍♀
15/09/2019, 07:32 - Bee: That's kind of them
15/09/2019, 07:33 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea! I prayed about your polio campaign yesterday. Is it still going on?
15/09/2019, 07:35 - Bee: Yes! Thank you. I'm tired already. We have to go to every house and ask if there are little kids. I'll be here until 5
15/09/2019, 07:42 - Bee: How are you managing breakfast?
15/09/2019, 07:43 - Nischal Abraham: Bread jam butter mayo eggs
15/09/2019, 08:09 - Bee: Ashley's birthday today
15/09/2019, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for letting me know. My goodness am I busy like crazy. But I'm home now... Need to tidy up my room. Let me know if you're free for a call anytime
15/09/2019, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Did you manage to go for the gospel meeting? Btw it's fine if we can't talk... I just hope you had a good day today :)
15/09/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Hey. :) I reached home at 6:30 so couldn't make it for the gospel meeting. No I can talk... If you're not too tired. In 30 minutes? Will that be okay?
15/09/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: That'll be fine :). I should be asking if you're not too tired! You must've been walking all day!
15/09/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Nischal!
15/09/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Hey buddy
15/09/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Why buddy
15/09/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Just cause :P
15/09/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Can I call you?
15/09/2019, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yes you can
15/09/2019, 20:29 - Bee: It was really nice talking to you Nischal. Goodnight :).
15/09/2019, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: It was nice 😌. Sleep well! I'll be praying that you complete your assignments and get good sleep
15/09/2019, 20:32 - Bee: Please pray that I wake up and not just turn the alarm off and go back to sleep
15/09/2019, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
15/09/2019, 20:32 - Bee: :P
15/09/2019, 20:32 - Bee: No but really
15/09/2019, 20:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'll do just that. Now sleep or you won't even get that much time
15/09/2019, 20:33 - Bee: Yes.
16/09/2019, 04:13 - Bee: Morning, Nischal. :)
16/09/2019, 04:31 - Bee: I hope you have a wonderful day and that God's presence is known by you as you do your stuff
16/09/2019, 06:43 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! That's a nice hope to have. The cold is making me lethargic in the morning :/. I slept for 8 and a half hours
16/09/2019, 13:06 - Bee: Maybe you were tired from the journey?
16/09/2019, 13:06 - Bee: It'll be difficult once your classes are in full swing
16/09/2019, 13:07 - Bee: Here. What did you learn a little too late?
16/09/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: There's no point in trying to bring sweaters from India
16/09/2019, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and also more full sleeve shirts the better
16/09/2019, 13:42 - Bee: So you going to Matunga was in vain?!
16/09/2019, 13:42 - Bee: At least you learnt it just two days after you arrived
16/09/2019, 13:42 - Bee: Isn't there a thermostat?
16/09/2019, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: I meant in general even outdoors. Full sleeve > half sleeves
16/09/2019, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Matunga wasn't in vain though. I did get useful stuff... Just underestimated the cold a lot 😅
16/09/2019, 14:06 - Bee: And you don't even have any fat to protect you! It must be gloomy there. Is it?
16/09/2019, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. Afternoon feels like morning. And morning feels like morning
16/09/2019, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Really good weather for walks
16/09/2019, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: It hasn't rained much today either
16/09/2019, 14:20 - Nischal Abraham: I've been lazing around at home most of the day. College only had IKEA trip today and the mail orientation meet is tomorrow. I did go check out the stores in the town though. Really pretty town
16/09/2019, 14:42 - Bee: You must be loving it then! Except for the cold
16/09/2019, 14:42 - Bee: And it's not even evening! Did you click any photos?
16/09/2019, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/09/2019, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/09/2019, 14:50 - Bee: This place is stunning
16/09/2019, 14:50 - Bee: Rn?
16/09/2019, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's my neighbourhood area... It was an hour back
16/09/2019, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Backyard pic was in the morning 😋
16/09/2019, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: The town looks a bit different. Full of shops... I'll take proper pics tomorrow when I head to the university
16/09/2019, 14:54 - Bee: I cannot stop looking at this
16/09/2019, 14:54 - Bee: So beautiful!!
16/09/2019, 14:54 - Bee: Yes please
16/09/2019, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: I think the photo makes it look duller than it actually was. But yea everything really pretty here. So organized
16/09/2019, 14:55 - Bee: So it looks even better?!
16/09/2019, 14:57 - Nischal Abraham: It does. This town is more of a residential area... Since it's away from Dublin. Dublin is proper city so a lot more people there. For the first 5 min of my walk I didn't see anyone 😂
16/09/2019, 15:02 - Bee: That's even better 😂
16/09/2019, 15:02 - Bee: How far is Dublin from where you live?
16/09/2019, 15:02 - Bee: What about today's lunch?
16/09/2019, 15:02 - Bee: Also, did you read the messages I sent while you were on the plane?
16/09/2019, 15:02 - Bee: I cooked on Saturday!!!
16/09/2019, 15:02 - Bee: And it wasn't bad
16/09/2019, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: By train I'd say 20 min
16/09/2019, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: By car 30
16/09/2019, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: Omigoodness that's awesome!! What'd you make?
16/09/2019, 15:03 - Bee: Jeera rice, dal, and lady finger sabji. It turned out to be good!n
16/09/2019, 15:04 - Bee: Poor Ruth was on video call the whole time guiding me through the process
16/09/2019, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
16/09/2019, 15:04 - Bee: And the train station from your place?
16/09/2019, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: 10 min walk
16/09/2019, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Mom wasn't around?
16/09/2019, 15:05 - Bee: No she wasn't and I wanted to learn Ruth's recipe
16/09/2019, 15:05 - Bee: Oh that's good. Not far
16/09/2019, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: Ruth has a secret jeera rice recipe?
16/09/2019, 15:06 - Bee: No she has a secret dal tadka recipe 😉
16/09/2019, 15:07 - Bee: I was thinking why I didn't try cooking before. I thought I'd suck at it even before I started
16/09/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: I went grocery shopping today but I didn't feel like I was ready for vegetable cooking so didn't buy any. I should probably start with rice since mom keeps saying it's the easiest thing
16/09/2019, 15:08 - Bee: It is. Especially in a pressure cooker
16/09/2019, 15:08 - Bee: That's one thing I don't mess up
16/09/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: I do have a pressure cooker
16/09/2019, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Instead I just bought carrots and capsicum to add to my Maggi for lunch 😅
16/09/2019, 15:09 - Bee: You have Maggi with you?! Nice
16/09/2019, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yea my mom packed a lot of stuff with me. I even have ready to make Chole something but that's for another day
16/09/2019, 15:13 - Bee: Chole something sounds good 😋
16/09/2019, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure it is ...  Until I try to make it 😂
16/09/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Nooo that's why I thought too but nooo
16/09/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Favorite food?
16/09/2019, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: Soon to be mom's cooking
16/09/2019, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: But if it's just one dish, idk... I was thinking about it... And I've grown out of liking outside food much. The best, most satisfying food I've eaten is Juliet aunty's cooking
16/09/2019, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: But I can't pin it down to one dish. I like a lot of food
16/09/2019, 15:19 - Bee: Nawwwww
16/09/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Staying away from home does that to you
16/09/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Oh yes!! I enjoyed the days I spent there before and during my exams
16/09/2019, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: You don't go there anymore?
16/09/2019, 15:27 - Bee: I did once. It was an impromptu thing...I keep meaning to drop by but it doesn't happen
16/09/2019, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Maybe during your next exam then
16/09/2019, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Btw my number in Ireland is +353 894858775
16/09/2019, 15:30 - Bee: No there's almost a year for that
16/09/2019, 15:30 - Bee: Are you changing your WhatsApp to this number?
16/09/2019, 15:30 - Bee: I shall save it
16/09/2019, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Not that you'll need to call on it but keep it... Just incase
16/09/2019, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: No... I'm planning on leaving it as is
16/09/2019, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: But if university communications are happening through WhatsApp then I may change it to the Irish number
16/09/2019, 15:32 - Bee: Saved it
16/09/2019, 15:33 - Bee: What did you read in your quiet time?
16/09/2019, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: I was reading through Isaiah 41
16/09/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Oh
16/09/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Do you follow a plan or a devotional?
16/09/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Or anything you're led to mediate on
16/09/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: Reenee messaged this morning with Isaiah 41:10. So I just went through the whole chapter
16/09/2019, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Well today morning there was some unlikely development in the house. It's difficult to explain over text
16/09/2019, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: But all messages I'm being led to always seems to be the one I need
16/09/2019, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: I don't follow a devotional though I probably should
16/09/2019, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: I generally choose a book and try to study it for a couple of weeks.. that leads me to refer other verses
16/09/2019, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: How about you?
16/09/2019, 15:37 - Bee: I started the book of Esther last week. I'm on chapter 2
16/09/2019, 15:38 - Bee: I followed devotionals for a long time but I found myself relying on them too much
16/09/2019, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Relying on then how?
16/09/2019, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: Like you couldn't spend quiet time without the devotional reading for the day?
16/09/2019, 15:45 - Bee: I focused more on what the devotional said instead of the Bible.. and I didn't dig in the word. I was satisfied that I've finished the devotional and had my quiet time.. I'm not saying one shouldn't read them...a devotional called Streams in the desert helped me a lot in Kerala
16/09/2019, 15:45 - Bee: But since a few months I've been trying to focus on just the Bible
16/09/2019, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. Yea I mean every discussion on quiet time always had the disclaimer of "use devotionals as reference only". I really want to do in depth study of books. But I feel my attention span doesn't allow me to do a lot at a time
16/09/2019, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: And also I need to take time out other than mornings to be doing studies. Mornings are for listening
16/09/2019, 15:52 - Bee: Mornings are for listening... I like that
16/09/2019, 15:54 - Bee: Reminds me of this statement today Johnny's father said when he gave preached
That quiet times and studies are different... I had forgotten about that. I've been trying to do the study in my quiet time
16/09/2019, 15:54 - Bee: Ignore the today
16/09/2019, 15:54 - Bee: Ignore the gave too
16/09/2019, 15:54 - Bee: Sorry
16/09/2019, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: You don't need to apologize. I'm sure I'm making plenty of grammar errors and don't even notice it 😶
16/09/2019, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: I remember that... Ooh maybe that's where I started thinking that way. It's true though... Studying the Bible is good but I feel it's essential to listen to what God has to say to us
16/09/2019, 16:01 - Bee: I don't either 🤷🏻‍♀
16/09/2019, 16:01 - Bee: Yeah. I've been doing it wrong
16/09/2019, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: There's always room to grow 😁
16/09/2019, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: So what're you up to? I just remembered!! Did you manage to finish your assignment stuff?
16/09/2019, 16:04 - Bee: There is :)
16/09/2019, 16:05 - Bee: Almost. Just a little bit here and there which I could've finished in college but the teacher didn't ask for it and nobody submitted so I didn't either
16/09/2019, 16:06 - Bee: I'm waiting for papa to come home. We're visiting one aunty who lives in Eden woods... Her foot got amputated. She's an unbeliever... Papa knows her from the hospital
16/09/2019, 16:08 - Bee: But I have another assignment so I'll probably be up tonight as well
16/09/2019, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's nice that you're visiting her. Your dad visits a lot of people doesn't he?
16/09/2019, 16:09 - Bee: He does... I try to join him when I can. Another reason why I'm grateful to be traveling to college instead of staying in the hostel
16/09/2019, 16:10 - Bee: Otherwise I would be missing out on this and a hundred other activities
16/09/2019, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! So no sleeping tonight either? You're just like Nidhi 😅
16/09/2019, 16:13 - Bee: Nidhi is on another level!! I wish I was
16/09/2019, 16:13 - Bee: I will sleep for a few hours. Can't go without sleep
16/09/2019, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Sleep is such a blessing... You should know better. Don't they talk about sleep in college?
16/09/2019, 16:14 - Bee: They did. I must've slept through it. :P
16/09/2019, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. Good one
16/09/2019, 16:15 - Bee: No I remember. I was awake. I had a whole unit in my first year
16/09/2019, 16:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Well I only have my experience to go by... And I'd rather sleep than not sleep nowadays. Though honestly I still don't sleep as much as I could (wasting my time on my phone)
16/09/2019, 16:18 - Bee: Same. It's become a habit for me. One I'm trying to break but terribly failing to do so
16/09/2019, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: I feel you. I think it's something EVERYBODY struggles with now. I'll let you know if I find a remedy :P
16/09/2019, 16:21 - Bee: PLEASE DO. I'll let you know if I find one. But I probably won't. Because of this other habit that I have. Procrastinating.
16/09/2019, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... I guess we'll never find a solution then. Cause I have the same habits 🤣
16/09/2019, 16:22 - Bee: What are we gonna do, Nischal!! First, we fail at social sciences and now this!!
16/09/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Eventually learn from our failure?
16/09/2019, 16:24 - Bee: You don't sound convinced?
16/09/2019, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: That's cause I'm not. But if we're in it together I'm fine with it 😌
16/09/2019, 16:25 - Bee: That we are.
16/09/2019, 16:26 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Hand to Hold by JJ Heller
https://open.spotify.com/track/7bpR5j22mNID1pXwgRcZP1?si=SZWqRPOiSSej6eeMMdJadw
16/09/2019, 16:26 - Bee: Have you heard this one?
16/09/2019, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't heard it before. Listening to it now
16/09/2019, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Did you share this for "sleep is made for dreaming"?
16/09/2019, 16:31 - Bee: 😂
16/09/2019, 16:31 - Bee: Nope. For "puddles are for jumping" 😌
16/09/2019, 16:33 - Bee: Papa has come. I'll go now
16/09/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's a nice song :)
16/09/2019, 16:33 - Bee: Yeah :)
16/09/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Okay cool! Have a blessed time
16/09/2019, 18:30 - Bee: That aunty said I remind her of her daughter. Who's in the US. Her eyes teared up 🥺
16/09/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Aww! Heart strings
16/09/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: So why did she have to get amputated?
16/09/2019, 18:37 - Bee: She is diabetic. So her foot started rotting from the bottom up... It happens when the blood sugar is out of control
16/09/2019, 18:37 - Bee: Not a pretty sight
16/09/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wow. I did not know that happens with diabetes
16/09/2019, 19:02 - Bee: Yep. One can go completely blind too
16/09/2019, 19:02 - Bee: Because of diabetes
16/09/2019, 19:03 - Bee: How has your day been so far? You okay?
16/09/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: I'm okay... Just feel like I'm wasting most of the day. I should've slept in the afternoon but didn't. I just lazed around
16/09/2019, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm hoping tomorrow turns out better. It's 7pm here and still bright out
16/09/2019, 19:05 - Bee: What's your schedule for tomorrow like? When do classes begin?
16/09/2019, 19:06 - Bee: Also, you don't have to keep replying to my messages. I'll understand if you can't
16/09/2019, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I can... I'm literally not doing anything right now. I'm in an empty house and I was lazing around in bed till I had to force myself to get up and come downstairs
16/09/2019, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: So now I've opened my laptop in hopes that I'll do more than browse YouTube videos all day
16/09/2019, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: So tomorrow there's a meet and greet at 3pm
16/09/2019, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing before that. I'm just confirming if I can get my Student ID made before that so I'll be able to travel cheaper
16/09/2019, 19:22 - Bee: Are you excited?
16/09/2019, 19:22 - Bee: Because I am!!
16/09/2019, 19:23 - Bee: And what are you doing?
16/09/2019, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Still looking up the student ID thing. I'll probably just send them a mail
16/09/2019, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: My forex card hasn't been activated either :(. I'm scared Debs... I don't know why sometimes I feel like everything will work out just fine and then at other times I completely forget that feeling
16/09/2019, 19:56 - Bee: Nischal
16/09/2019, 19:57 - Bee: Hasn't everything worked out until now?
16/09/2019, 19:57 - Bee: Do you want to talk?
16/09/2019, 19:58 - Bee: God has already gone before you
16/09/2019, 19:59 - Bee: I know it's easy for me say... But hasn't He shown Himself to be faithful before
16/09/2019, 20:01 - Bee: You're in a new country. Away from home. You'll feel that way. But pray whenever you do. Consciously try to not dwell on it
16/09/2019, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yea you're right. I know all of it too. Well I just spoke to my parents and Cherian called up to check on me
16/09/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: It's alright. I'm just slightly venting. And you've got assignment stuff to do!
17/09/2019, 01:08 - Bee: Hey. I fell asleep. :(
17/09/2019, 01:09 - Bee: I hope you're feeling better after a good night's rest
17/09/2019, 01:13 - Bee: Praying for you.
17/09/2019, 02:35 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… You Were There by Avalon
https://open.spotify.com/track/2pP7drbybtX017isAKkcLm?si=-wLv2BReS4Cq1BGZiGyxkA
17/09/2019, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: I do feel better now... Thanks for praying. Hope you have an amazing day ahead(although your day's already started)
17/09/2019, 09:09 - Bee: I've had a great day so far. I'll tell you about it tonight
17/09/2019, 09:19 - Bee: Can I call you tonight? Nothing specific... Just to talk
17/09/2019, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to talk to you. But do you mean your night or my night?
17/09/2019, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: Well either way just send me a message beforehand. Glad to hear you're having a good day! I'll be starting mine 😁
17/09/2019, 11:05 - Bee: My night. I'll message you before
17/09/2019, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I finally arrived college today!!
17/09/2019, 14:47 - Nischal Abraham: At* sorry
17/09/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Noooooo
17/09/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Is it gorgeous?!
17/09/2019, 17:36 - Bee: How did the meet and greet go?
17/09/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Are you back home?
17/09/2019, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: It was good! I only met one other person who's in the course with me
17/09/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: But I met 2 of my professors
17/09/2019, 17:37 - Bee: Were they friendly?
17/09/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2019, 17:37 - Bee: Is this one your way to college?
17/09/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea they're all friendly. I'm on the cycleway home. But I'm walking 😂
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Bee: On*
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: That's what's immediately in front of mr
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Me* really sorry
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Bee: You could just keep walking and not get tired it's so pretty
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Bee: Noooo
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Bee: No apologizing for typos.
17/09/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Well I did it one way. And now I'm really tired but no choice but move forward
17/09/2019, 17:39 - Bee: 6 kilometers is a lot
17/09/2019, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's actually 7 from exactly where I stay
17/09/2019, 17:39 - Bee: Isn't it 6km far?
17/09/2019, 17:39 - Bee: Oh
17/09/2019, 17:39 - Bee: How much more to go?
17/09/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm 3/4th of the way back
17/09/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Ahh
17/09/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Did you get your student ID?
17/09/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Nope... My registration date is on the 24th now. I'll need to get a bus card soon though. Today is closed early unfortunately
17/09/2019, 17:43 - Bee: There are buses to college?
17/09/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Bus and train. So Ireland has these things called a leap card which is like a prepaid card for all public transport
17/09/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: And if I have my student ID I can get a student one which is discounted rates
17/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Oh like Singapore
17/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: So you'll have to wait for a week
17/09/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'm gonna try applying online and see if I can do it without a physical student id card. I have my student ID number already
17/09/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Have you reached home?
17/09/2019, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: We can talk if you want. I'm almost home
17/09/2019, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Now I've reached home
17/09/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Can I call?
18/09/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I hope your presentation went well. I've been praying this morning as well.
I was led to John 7 today... "My time has not yet come". Not sure how to read that but it's what stood out to me
18/09/2019, 14:13 - Bee: Hey :)
18/09/2019, 14:13 - Bee: I think it went well...better than I thought
18/09/2019, 14:15 - Bee: Thank you for praying, Nischal :)
18/09/2019, 14:22 - Bee: I'm still here. I'll reply in some time
18/09/2019, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear! I had a fun day today :). Found a playground in Maynooth but I only see kids playing so I'm not going there
18/09/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: And I got my leapcard done too!! Travel won't be a problem anymore 😁
18/09/2019, 18:53 - Bee: HEY
18/09/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Woohoooo!
18/09/2019, 18:54 - Bee: You should join them. And find out if you'll be yelled at.
18/09/2019, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Decided to go for the prayer meeting in Dublin. Travelling in the train and it's so empty. The seats are like a private bus and they all have tray tables 😅
18/09/2019, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Also both buses and trains have their own WiFi
18/09/2019, 18:57 - Bee: Wow. Missing the local train? 😛
18/09/2019, 19:00 - Bee: How did the meeting go?
18/09/2019, 19:00 - Bee: Also, you went to college as well right?
18/09/2019, 19:00 - Bee: What about breakfast and lunch and dinner?
18/09/2019, 19:00 - Bee: Too many questions.
18/09/2019, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... I did go to college. Today was fun... Had a treasure hunt kinda game but I met some new people I may never meet again in my duration of the course
18/09/2019, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Dinner was served by college for international students... Which consisted of free burger and fries and cold drinks
18/09/2019, 19:01 - Bee: Not too early for dinner?
18/09/2019, 19:02 - Bee: You'll be hungry!!
18/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Probably is... But I'm full now. I think I overate
18/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: OH! And there was ice-cream too!
18/09/2019, 19:02 - Bee: You could take as many as you wanted?
18/09/2019, 19:02 - Bee: Oh!! Which flavor?
18/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep all you can eat. Ice-cream was vanilla
18/09/2019, 19:03 - Bee: Ahh. Was it Amul vanilla?
18/09/2019, 19:03 - Bee: :P
18/09/2019, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
18/09/2019, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>

18/09/2019, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Na never as good as amul :P
18/09/2019, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: And the meeting is in an hour. I'm on my way there now
18/09/2019, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: You must be tired from the presentation right? Sleep early today
18/09/2019, 19:10 - Bee: Did you make friends?
18/09/2019, 19:10 - Bee: OH. I forgot about the time difference for a moment.
18/09/2019, 19:11 - Bee: I am. Going to sleep now
18/09/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: I think Juan is a friend now. Met him again today :). He's a nice guy.
18/09/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Goodnight! I'm reaching my destination too. Talk tomorrow!
18/09/2019, 19:13 - Bee: Good to hear that. Same course? (I think you mentioned but I can't remember)
18/09/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))))))))))) 🤗
19/09/2019, 08:37 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! He's not in the same course sadly. But I'll keep meeting him during orientation week at least
19/09/2019, 08:38 - Nischal Abraham: I had quiet a lot of new experiences yesterday... Very interesting day
19/09/2019, 11:30 - Bee: Hey :)
19/09/2019, 11:30 - Bee: Tell me about them tonight!!
19/09/2019, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'll try and free up time tonight. I'll probably be in college till 8pm local time for events today though
19/09/2019, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: But we'll work something out. How's your day going?
19/09/2019, 11:41 - Bee: It's going well. I came to college after lunch for research. Still here
19/09/2019, 11:42 - Bee: Sounds exciting!!
19/09/2019, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yea there's some Irish dancing stuff 😅
19/09/2019, 11:51 - Bee: 🤩 I hope you dance. :P
19/09/2019, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so too 😂. I'll try and get pics as well. But yea that means it'll be after 12:30am there
19/09/2019, 11:59 - Bee: Yes please!!
19/09/2019, 12:00 - Bee: I think I'll be up. I'll message if I'm going to sleep before your events get over
19/09/2019, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'll message after the events are up. It's an empty bus ride back and a lonely walk home from the bus stop anyway :P
19/09/2019, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Btw if you're sleepy please go to sleep. Don't stay up on my account. I'll just have more stories to share tomorrow :D
19/09/2019, 12:53 - Bee: If I'm sleepy I'll go to sleep
19/09/2019, 12:53 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
19/09/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: A bit worse then planned but it's alright. There was an optional meet today which I couldn't attend because I got up late, and then the bus ended up being full, and at that point I just decided I'd not go
19/09/2019, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: So instead I went and shopped for oranges and bananas since I get hungry between meals and needed something to munch on
19/09/2019, 13:16 - Bee: Are they tastier? Orange-er? Juicier?
19/09/2019, 13:17 - Bee: It's been a week
19/09/2019, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: What's been a week?
19/09/2019, 13:24 - Bee: Since I last met you. I'm not counting Friday
19/09/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: Well it could just be a week since we went for a walk... And then you can count Friday 😁
19/09/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Oh yes.
19/09/2019, 13:26 - Bee: I'll say this again tomorrow. :P
19/09/2019, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to it :). Are you on your way back?
19/09/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Yes. Waiting for the bus
19/09/2019, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: You take the bus? From Thane station?
19/09/2019, 13:27 - Bee: Yeah. That way I don't have to walk for the share auto and then walk again from meadows
19/09/2019, 13:28 - Bee: The bus stops right outside the gate
19/09/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's nice. The bus seems like the better option all the time then
19/09/2019, 13:29 - Bee: Yeah... Sometimes the queue is too long so I take the auto. But I'd rather wait
19/09/2019, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: Is it raining today as well?
19/09/2019, 13:30 - Bee: It was raining until 2ish
19/09/2019, 13:30 - Bee: Many schools and colleges got a holiday today
19/09/2019, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: Whaaat!! Is it still raining so heavily 😮. I thought it'd end by now
19/09/2019, 13:33 - Bee: Ikr?! It should've stopped by now
19/09/2019, 13:34 - Bee: How's the weather there?
19/09/2019, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: And it hasn't rained for 2 days here... Today is sunny too... Looks like Mumbai's taken all the rain clouds
19/09/2019, 13:35 - Bee: Sunny!! Must be beautiful outside
19/09/2019, 13:36 - Nischal Abraham: Very bright. I mean it's afternoon now and clear skies. Too warm for a jacket but too cold without it 😅. The temperature is much higher today though. It's at 20C now and it was 8C when I left in the morning
19/09/2019, 13:45 - Bee: So are you wearing a jacket?
19/09/2019, 13:45 - Bee: What time do you have to leave for college?
19/09/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: In 15 min. Buses are every half hour so there's no point leaving early and standing at the bus stand
19/09/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Also I only need to reach by 3:45
19/09/2019, 13:46 - Bee: And how long does it take?
19/09/2019, 13:46 - Bee: You told me once.
19/09/2019, 13:46 - Bee: I don't remember. Sorry.
19/09/2019, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: 10 min bus ride once it starts. So even though the distance might be a lot since the roads are so we'll organized and the speed limit is like 70kmph it's really quick getting around places
19/09/2019, 13:47 - Bee: Whooaa
19/09/2019, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Even I don't remember telling you so I'm sorry 😅
19/09/2019, 13:47 - Bee: That's good!! You're not spending a lot of time traveling
19/09/2019, 13:47 - Bee: Unless you take the bicycle
19/09/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: If I plan it right then yea... Otherwise I just miss my event if I'm late and don't have a cycle :(
19/09/2019, 13:50 - Bee: Oh
19/09/2019, 13:50 - Bee: I checked and it's almost the same distance from Thane station to Meadows. But it takes so long! I still haven't reached Majiwada
19/09/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Haha yea distances are different here... Especially between Kilcock and Maynooth because there's no stops in between... Like it's a direct bus
19/09/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Oh wow. Not even one?
19/09/2019, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: There's nothing but fields between the two places 😂. That's why the cycle path also just goes all the way
19/09/2019, 13:58 - Bee: Oh
19/09/2019, 13:59 - Bee: Hyderabadi biryani is no longer in Meadows
19/09/2019, 13:59 - Bee: Just so you know
19/09/2019, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. They moved base? Or did they just close down
19/09/2019, 14:01 - Bee: They moved base. It's a few doors down from Swamy
19/09/2019, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Well hope we get to talk tonight. Travel safe!
19/09/2019, 14:31 - Bee: I reached home. Trying to get stuff done before the Bible study. Have fun, Nischal!! Dance, okay?
19/09/2019, 14:32 - Bee: I'll talk to you later.
19/09/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'll dance. Only cause you asked me to. Have fun at Bible study!
19/09/2019, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'm done
19/09/2019, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: And it was SO FUN!! Oh my goodness I won't remember any of the dances but I had an amazing time
19/09/2019, 20:26 - Bee: Nischal!!
19/09/2019, 20:29 - Bee: Wru
19/09/2019, 20:29 - Bee: Nischal
19/09/2019, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hi. Sleep?
19/09/2019, 20:35 - Bee: I'm awake. Call? If your aren't tired
19/09/2019, 20:35 - Bee: You*
19/09/2019, 23:26 - Bee: I have a feeling Jason knows
19/09/2019, 23:27 - Bee: He was asking me what time it was in the country where the person I was talking to was
19/09/2019, 23:27 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
19/09/2019, 23:28 - Nischal Abraham: Why aren't you asleep!?
19/09/2019, 23:28 - Bee: Thankfully the lights were off
19/09/2019, 23:28 - Bee: Because Jason is trying to get info out of me
19/09/2019, 23:28 - Nischal Abraham: Tell him it's late and you need to sleep 😂
19/09/2019, 23:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well now it'll sound like you're hiding something
19/09/2019, 23:29 - Bee: I'm ignoring him
19/09/2019, 23:29 - Nischal Abraham: Good luck! If he forbids you from talking to me again then I'm glad we got to spend so long today
19/09/2019, 23:29 - Bee: Too late
19/09/2019, 23:29 - Bee: He won't do that
19/09/2019, 23:30 - Bee: He'll just keep teasing me
19/09/2019, 23:30 - Nischal Abraham: I guess you'll have to stop teasing him for his long convos now
19/09/2019, 23:30 - Bee: I will. I'll just use it against him if he teases me.
19/09/2019, 23:30 - Bee: Going to sleep.
19/09/2019, 23:30 - Bee: Bye, Nischal. :)
19/09/2019, 23:31 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Goodnight! ☺😌
19/09/2019, 23:31 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you don't feel too tired and sleepy later today
19/09/2019, 23:31 - Bee: I may not. I'll be thinking of the conversation.
19/09/2019, 23:32 - Nischal Abraham: Is there so much to think about? 😮
19/09/2019, 23:32 - Nischal Abraham: Okay sorry... No more talk. Go to sleep. We'll talk later
19/09/2019, 23:32 - Bee: No no. Not like that. Just that I wish we could've talked longer
19/09/2019, 23:33 - Bee: Yep.
19/09/2019, 23:33 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay
19/09/2019, 23:33 - Nischal Abraham: Byeeeeee
20/09/2019, 06:29 - Bee: Hey :)
20/09/2019, 06:30 - Bee: I'm not sleepy. In case you were wondering
20/09/2019, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: Morning! Well I guess it's already afternoon
20/09/2019, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear 😌. Have a wonderful day!
20/09/2019, 09:27 - Bee: You too. :)
20/09/2019, 11:50 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Tu Hai Wajah by Piyush Bhisekar

20/09/2019, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
20/09/2019, 12:57 - Bee: Is there a name for this dance? Or is it called just Irish dance?
20/09/2019, 12:57 - Bee: It looks fun!! And easy!
20/09/2019, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: It's called Ceili dancing. Each dance has a name but I couldn't make out what it was called. I think they're named after the song it's for?
20/09/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: It is easy!! That's why I managed to do it. It's a lot of hop skip and claps
20/09/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: https://culturenight.ie/events/dublin

21/09/2019, 10:10 - Bee: Sounds like you had a great time 😃
21/09/2019, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: Let's talk today. I'm home all day
21/09/2019, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Only if you're free to.
21/09/2019, 11:00 - Bee: I would love to. I'm at home today. Got a holiday. Trying to complete an assignment rn. I'll message later? In an hour or so
21/09/2019, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Finish up your work and let me know
21/09/2019, 12:00 - Bee: Nischal

21/09/2019, 12:01 - Bee: 😒
21/09/2019, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: What 😂
21/09/2019, 17:13 - Bee: I made dal again 🥺
21/09/2019, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! Did you do it without any instruction this time?
21/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Yessss
21/09/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! I'm off to buy pulao ingredients. I already have the rice so just a bunch of vegetables. And on that excuse I'll get today's exercise walking as well 😂
21/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: And masalas? Sorry I keep mentioning them but I think they're really important
21/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Have fun!
21/09/2019, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea masala... I'll see what's available. Might just have to make do with ginger, garlic and chillies
21/09/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I guess it won't really be a pulao without the spices. Ah well. I'll eat whatever it ends up becoming :P
21/09/2019, 19:15 - Bee: You don't have the spices?
21/09/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Have you made it yet?
21/09/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Goodnight, boyfriend. :P :)
21/09/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I found cumin powder. And ginger and garlic. So that's it
21/09/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know how it ends up. Just starting now
21/09/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee!
21/09/2019, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
21/09/2019, 21:18 - Nischal Abraham: It looks a lot better than it tastes. It tastes like nothing 😂. But I'm so glad I made it. Only room for improvement now
22/09/2019, 07:15 - Bee: It does look good 😋
22/09/2019, 07:15 - Bee: Not bad for your first try! :)
22/09/2019, 07:32 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. Mom's already given tips on improving it so hopefully tonight will be tastier
22/09/2019, 14:56 - Bee: Hey

23/09/2019, 05:48 - Bee: Do you have college today?
23/09/2019, 05:48 - Bee: Have a great day! :)
23/09/2019, 08:52 - Nischal Abraham: All part of things I need to explain 😶. Well I do have a college thing but I've decided against going. Let's talk today I'll let you know
23/09/2019, 12:30 - Bee: Oh...okay? I should reach home in 2 hours
23/09/2019, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. I'm planning on calling home too. Been a while since I've spoken to my parents
23/09/2019, 13:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be changing my WhatsApp number to my Ireland number as it'll be easier to network with people here.
My number in Ireland is +353 894858775
23/09/2019, 13:26 - Bee: This makes sense
23/09/2019, 14:22 - Bee: This message was deleted
23/09/2019, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Debby

23/09/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Our shortest conversation
23/09/2019, 17:59 - Bee: 😂
23/09/2019, 17:59 - Bee: 55 seconds
23/09/2019, 17:59 - Bee: That is a deep cut. :(
23/09/2019, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it is. But I really didn't feel any pain till he jabbed me with a syringe
23/09/2019, 18:00 - Bee: Is it paining now?
23/09/2019, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. No pain. Just restricted movement due to the wrapping
23/09/2019, 18:02 - Bee: Oh... Could've been worse. That's what I've been telling myself
23/09/2019, 18:02 - Bee: Bye. :)
23/09/2019, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: I've been telling myself that too ☺. Goodnight!
24/09/2019, 00:28 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. I know it's early morning for you. Well just let me know when you're up. Thanks
24/09/2019, 01:41 - Bee: Hey

24/09/2019, 01:41 - Nischal Abraham: Hey :)
24/09/2019, 01:42 - Bee: Hey :)

24/09/2019, 01:42 - Bee: Today I'll leave at 7:10
24/09/2019, 01:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I was just feeling a bit low earlier
24/09/2019, 01:44 - Nischal Abraham: Fixed myself some dinner so I feel better now... I ended up falling asleep after I said goodnight to you
24/09/2019, 01:44 - Nischal Abraham: I guess the tiredness of last night was still there
24/09/2019, 01:45 - Nischal Abraham: So when I get up at 12 am not having had dinner I felt like I messed up somehow. Well that was what I was feeling anyway... And clueless
24/09/2019, 01:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just venting btw... I'm not really looking for answers or anything
24/09/2019, 01:47 - Bee: Can I call you in 5?
24/09/2019, 01:47 - Bee: No reason
24/09/2019, 01:47 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
24/09/2019, 03:41 - Bee: Nischal

24/09/2019, 06:39 - Bee: I hope you're sleeping...
24/09/2019, 06:39 - Bee: Praying for you
24/09/2019, 06:48 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/09/2019, 06:59 - Bee: College!!!!!!!!!!
24/09/2019, 06:59 - Bee: I hope you haven't overslept
24/09/2019, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: I did sleep. I'm surprised I managed to but I'm up now. I'll be on time. I put an alarm before going to sleep
24/09/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Hey. You okay?
24/09/2019, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well. Much better than Jake anyway. He looks terribly depressed and there's nothing I can do about it 😞
24/09/2019, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: Got my registration done at the university. Turns out lectures are starting from next week so I'm mostly free this week too.
And I heard some other stuff about my course too
24/09/2019, 13:56 - Bee: Oh no. Have you spoken to him? More than a greeting?
24/09/2019, 13:57 - Bee: Is orientation over? What about the football tryouts you mentioned?
24/09/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: Orientation stuff is over. I'll be skipping football tryouts due to my hand. I think it's better if I take it slow for now. This week is Freshers week so a lot of parties but they're all in the night. I'll probably only go for one
24/09/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. I'm giving him his space... He said he's getting better so I'll just be praying about it
24/09/2019, 16:24 - Bee: Brb
24/09/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you'll be at prayer meeting today
24/09/2019, 17:12 - Bee: I was at the prayer meeting
24/09/2019, 17:12 - Bee: We're out for dinner
24/09/2019, 17:12 - Bee: Lakshmi's birthday
24/09/2019, 17:12 - Bee: Plus Ben's here!
24/09/2019, 17:12 - Bee: I'll probably take longer
24/09/2019, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh enjoy yourself Debby!! Plus Ben's there! You know it takes longer for it to be night here than there right?
24/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Why just one?
24/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Oh... I'll pray for him too
24/09/2019, 17:46 - Bee: I keep forgetting.
24/09/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Cause I don't like partying
24/09/2019, 17:47 - Bee: There should be another acronym because I sent brb and o thought Oh no I'll take longer to reply
24/09/2019, 17:47 - Bee: I*
24/09/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Why are you messaging me instead of partying longer!?
24/09/2019, 17:48 - Bee: .
24/09/2019, 17:48 - Bee: :P
24/09/2019, 17:48 - Bee: I'm back home
24/09/2019, 17:48 - Bee: How's your hand?
24/09/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: The hand's doing alright. Cold climate means I don't sweat much so it's not itchy
24/09/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: I managed to cycle to and from college too since the weather was dry
24/09/2019, 17:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/09/2019, 17:49 - Bee: 14 kilometers?!?!
24/09/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Wow.
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: I'm impressed
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Why tongue? I don't get it
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Oh
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: I was referring to an old conversation
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: It's okay
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: It wasn't easy 😅. I'm terribly out of shape. I was leisure cycling
24/09/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Is it one with gears?
24/09/2019, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I don't understand how they work so I just keep it on 3 or 4
24/09/2019, 17:52 - Bee: I don't understand either
24/09/2019, 17:53 - Bee: I once went for a long ride in Papa's cycle and I had a terrible time
24/09/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: There's only gear cycles here. In fact cycles are super fancy here since their more common then motor bikes
24/09/2019, 17:53 - Bee: That was after he explained how they work for around 15 minutes
24/09/2019, 17:54 - Bee: Oh
24/09/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Terrible as in you fell?
24/09/2019, 17:56 - Bee: No I was out of breath after the first 10 minutes... I've been told that using the right gears make the rides easier
24/09/2019, 17:56 - Bee: It's different having Ben here...not bad, just different
24/09/2019, 17:57 - Bee: He wants to make plans but I'm swamped with college/posting stuff and I'm usually tired
24/09/2019, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like the time Sahil visited. No one's ever free all the time
24/09/2019, 17:57 - Bee: And I don't want him to be upset because of me
24/09/2019, 17:57 - Bee: 😶
24/09/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Yeah
24/09/2019, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Why not just make a weekend plan or something
24/09/2019, 17:58 - Bee: He has a family thing this weekend.. he said he'll let me know later
24/09/2019, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: How long is he there for?
24/09/2019, 17:58 - Bee: I think 3 weeks
24/09/2019, 17:59 - Bee: 5 weeks
24/09/2019, 17:59 - Bee: So there's time
24/09/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: That's a lot of time... I'm sure you'll sync up someday
24/09/2019, 18:01 - Bee: Yeah
24/09/2019, 18:01 - Bee: I have holidays for Diwali as well
24/09/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea!!! You'll definitely get time then 😁. Don't be so worried about upsetting Ben Debs. I'm sure he understands
24/09/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Yeah
24/09/2019, 18:04 - Bee: I should stop thinking about it
24/09/2019, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Oh aren't you going with Amaresh uncle and family during Diwali?
24/09/2019, 18:24 - Bee: Yes 🤦🏻‍♀ I forgot about that
24/09/2019, 18:25 - Bee: I'll make time before that
24/09/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure you will :)
24/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: What's up?
24/09/2019, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'm forcing myself to do something productive and not fall asleep in bed again today :P
24/09/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Like what?
24/09/2019, 18:28 - Bee: Are you tired? :O
24/09/2019, 18:28 - Bee: 14 kilometers!! You must be tired
24/09/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: I am a bit tired. But its only 6:30 in the evening. Its more the cold that's making me lazy
24/09/2019, 18:30 - Bee: Write a song!!
24/09/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Without my guitar!?
24/09/2019, 18:30 - Bee: That probably doesn't happen on demand
24/09/2019, 18:31 - Bee: No? Okay
24/09/2019, 18:31 - Bee: Make a playlist on Spotify
24/09/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe I could... I didn't even think about it. Well I'm just making sure I don't open YouTube and watch random videos
24/09/2019, 18:31 - Bee: Meal prep!
24/09/2019, 18:32 - Bee: You can nana
24/09/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Wow you've got amazing suggestions 😮. Well I do have important stuff I should be doing so I'll just do that first
24/09/2019, 18:33 - Bee: You're too kind nana
24/09/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not really :P
24/09/2019, 18:36 - Bee: Thats what kind people say
24/09/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: You're too kind nana
24/09/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Thanks. 😂
24/09/2019, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Not sleeping?
24/09/2019, 19:05 - Bee: I'll sleep in 15
24/09/2019, 19:05 - Bee: I have to thing tomorrow
24/09/2019, 19:05 - Bee: A health talk
24/09/2019, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! You're giving the talk or attending it?
24/09/2019, 19:05 - Bee: I have to teach a few pregnant women how to take care of themselves during pregnancy... What to eat and stuff like that
24/09/2019, 19:06 - Bee: I'm giving it
24/09/2019, 19:06 - Bee: It is an evaluatory assignment
24/09/2019, 19:06 - Bee: The best part is... I have to do it in Marathi because that's what most women there understand :P
24/09/2019, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome... You're fluent in Marathi? I didn't know that
24/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: Not fluent but I can manage
24/09/2019, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Enough to teach about pregnancy is fluent in my books :P
24/09/2019, 19:07 - Bee: I learnt to speak after MGM because most of the patients who come here are from villages around Panvel and they understand only Marathi
24/09/2019, 19:09 - Bee: No I sat with a friend of mine and she translated every word!! I hope I remember
24/09/2019, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Well all the best for tomorrow. I'll be praying that all goes well 😁
24/09/2019, 19:11 - Bee: Thank you :)
24/09/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: How was the party?
24/09/2019, 19:18 - Bee: It was alright. The food was good. We went to the Momos place near Lok 😋
24/09/2019, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... I missed it 😭
24/09/2019, 19:20 - Bee: For the prayer meeting Lakshmi and I were in the same group. I'm encouraged by her prayer... The way she prayed. I'm not talking about the words she used but just that I could make out she talks to her Father quite often
24/09/2019, 19:20 - Bee: Few more days
24/09/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Few...
24/09/2019, 19:21 - Bee: Yes.
24/09/2019, 19:21 - Bee: 356 is few compared to a thousand right
24/09/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: That's lovely!
24/09/2019, 19:22 - Bee: Yeah :)
24/09/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Idk why for me I naturally tend to pray differently alone compared to publicly
24/09/2019, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure they're both genuine... Just something I've noticed. Slightly influenced by how I've heard others pray
24/09/2019, 19:25 - Bee: Same! I become conscious and then I have to mentally smack myself on the head
24/09/2019, 19:25 - Bee: Because then focus more on the words I'm using
24/09/2019, 19:25 - Bee: I focus*
24/09/2019, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Well that's time up for you. You should be sleeping if you have to do stuff tomorrow
24/09/2019, 19:26 - Bee: Yep
24/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: I'll go to sleep now
24/09/2019, 19:27 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
24/09/2019, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight :)
24/09/2019, 19:29 - Bee: I miss you. Thinking of you very often.
24/09/2019, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Me too Debby :(
24/09/2019, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: I try not to say it so I don't feel bad
24/09/2019, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Alright Cherian calling... I'll talk tomorrow
24/09/2019, 19:32 - Bee: Alright. Bye
25/09/2019, 05:13 - Bee: No health talk today. It was gonna be outdoors because the houses are too small and it was sunny the last two days. But it's raining heavily today
25/09/2019, 05:14 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
25/09/2019, 05:14 - Bee: How's your hand?
25/09/2019, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Today is a stay at home day. Will go to Fairview Hall in the evening.
My hand is doing fine. I can move my fingers fine and hold light objects. Still can't hold any weight with it
25/09/2019, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no. So it's postponed for later then? It's been sunny for the last two days here too... But looks like it'll rain today
25/09/2019, 10:52 - Bee: Prayer meeting?
25/09/2019, 10:52 - Bee: Have they told you anything about changing the dressing?
25/09/2019, 10:52 - Bee: I think it'll be tomorrow
25/09/2019, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/09/2019, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
25/09/2019, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool
25/09/2019, 10:54 - Bee: What's up?
25/09/2019, 10:58 - Bee: https://youtu.be/fQhj_aKQkBY
25/09/2019, 11:04 - Nischal Abraham: I had bacon for breakfast today. It's more like a snack than a meal though
25/09/2019, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: Wow!! That's amazing coordination! And for so many people too 😱
25/09/2019, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'm wondering how they managed to record the audio for it
25/09/2019, 11:52 - Bee: Yeeaaaahh!! 🤩
25/09/2019, 11:52 - Bee: Being a part of something like that is on my bucket list
25/09/2019, 11:53 - Bee: Hidden microphones maybe?
25/09/2019, 11:53 - Bee: No?
25/09/2019, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: So you do believe you sing well!
25/09/2019, 11:54 - Bee: 😂 no no
25/09/2019, 11:54 - Nischal Abraham: Really good audio editor. They would've recorded the instruments later and added it in
25/09/2019, 11:54 - Bee: This will he a huuuuuge group so I won't be heard
25/09/2019, 11:54 - Bee: Oh. Yes the music sounds very clear
25/09/2019, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: Of course you'll be heard! Isn't that the whole point of singing
25/09/2019, 11:58 - Nischal Abraham: This reminds me of another video... I'll share it with you when I find it. How's your day been?
25/09/2019, 12:07 - Bee: I could keep debating about this :P
25/09/2019, 12:08 - Bee: My day was goood! Since the health talk was cancelled a few of us went up this hill nearby.. slightly steeper than the Sanjay Gandhi one here but then view from the top was quite similar
25/09/2019, 12:08 - Bee: The*
25/09/2019, 12:08 - Bee: And it had just rained so the clouds were low and it was beautiful
25/09/2019, 12:10 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
25/09/2019, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that sounds wonderful. So you had a day off from college?
25/09/2019, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: I ate breakfast. Now I'm wrapped up in my blanket.
25/09/2019, 12:10 - Bee: No. The hill is a few minutes away from the slums where I'm posted for community postings
25/09/2019, 12:12 - Bee: Too cold?
25/09/2019, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Its chilly. And the blanket is cozy :P
25/09/2019, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/xh6QX39vsIg
25/09/2019, 12:13 - Bee: I'll have to wait until I get home to listen to it
25/09/2019, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. Its called Apartment sessions. It just blows my mind that people can coordinate so well
25/09/2019, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: So you went trekking!! Didn't the rain make it difficult?
25/09/2019, 12:19 - Bee: It did. I didn't wear my Crocs today because it was sunny the last two days and I thought it wouldn't rain today. I wore my walking shoes and they're all muddy now. I think it was worth the trouble though. The rain made it prettier
25/09/2019, 12:21 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. You have Crocs too!?
25/09/2019, 12:23 - Bee: Yes. I mentioned it on one of our walks :P
25/09/2019, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Did you now... I guess I didn't notice. Well my Crocs are just homewear now. I'd be insane to leave my feet bare to the cold here 😅
25/09/2019, 12:27 - Bee: 😂 you hardly got to wear them
25/09/2019, 12:29 - Nischal Abraham: I wear them all the time. Just indoors... It's my slippers at home :P
But yea I wish I had them earlier when I was there. I didn't realise how easy they are to wear. I was struggling with my Bata sandals 😂
25/09/2019, 12:39 - Bee: 😂
25/09/2019, 12:39 - Bee: Crocs are convenient and comfortable. I've been wearing crocs for the last 6 years or so
25/09/2019, 12:39 - Bee: I sound like a salesman
25/09/2019, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Woah... I thought they were overrated for so long
25/09/2019, 12:41 - Bee: Ahh
25/09/2019, 12:41 - Bee: But now you're wearing them
25/09/2019, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yea but I don't think I'd have bought a pair if I wasn't coming to Ireland. Like I shopped for a lot of things I normally wouldn't buy... Really went out of my comfort zone
25/09/2019, 12:54 - Bee: Like a pressure cooker
25/09/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Well didn't really but that. It was given to me by my mom
25/09/2019, 13:21 - Bee: Clothes?
25/09/2019, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yea mostly the clothes
25/09/2019, 13:23 - Bee: What did you read in your quiet time today?
25/09/2019, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Hebrews 12. I was drawn to God dealing with us as a father deals with his son
25/09/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: But today felt like one of those days where I had to push myself for quiet time. It's like the more free time I have the less I feel like spending with God.
I know that's a terrible thing to say... It's just the feeling that I get from time to time. It's especially then that I push myself to take more time out for the Bible
25/09/2019, 13:45 - Bee: No I get it. I haven't had my quiet time yet. Didn't 'feel' like it in the morning...one of those days. I will have it as soon is I'm done with my snack
25/09/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Thank you for sharing this
25/09/2019, 13:46 - Bee: Sometimes I don't even push myself
25/09/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: If I wasn't home all day I'd probably just use that as an excuse to skip. I get the feeling
25/09/2019, 14:35 - Bee: I had my quiet time :) prayed more than I read
25/09/2019, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome 😌. Idk why I feel sooo lazy today
25/09/2019, 18:11 - Bee: I fell asleep Nischal
25/09/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Just woke up
25/09/2019, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Staying up tonight?
25/09/2019, 18:23 - Bee: Yes. No assignment but I'll study for a while
25/09/2019, 18:24 - Bee: What time will you leave for the meeting?
25/09/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'm waiting at the bus stop now. Just so I don't miss it 😅. It'll probably take another 10 min to be here
25/09/2019, 18:30 - Bee: What time will you be back?
25/09/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Well it ends around 9-9:30 Irish time. Probably like last time I'll take the 10:30 bus from Dublin. Reach home by 11:30
25/09/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: It'll probably be time for you to get ready for college by then
25/09/2019, 18:35 - Bee: Oh
25/09/2019, 18:35 - Bee: I didn't talk to you in two days :(
25/09/2019, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: We'll talk. I'm home tomorrow... And don't keep counting the days you'll only make yourself feel bad :(
25/09/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Once my lectures start who knows how often we'll get to speak and for how long. And the you'll have exams and days you're busy...
25/09/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: But that's all in the future. Today take it as a blessing you get study time 😊
25/09/2019, 18:44 - Bee: Tomorrow.
25/09/2019, 18:44 - Bee: Yeah :(
25/09/2019, 18:44 - Bee: You're in a melon. 🍉 😭🤗
25/09/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: What? 😂
25/09/2019, 18:45 - Bee: Sorry I forgot to add One.
You're one in a melon. 🍉 😭🤗
25/09/2019, 18:45 - Bee: 😂
25/09/2019, 18:46 - Bee: My failed attempts at being cheesy
25/09/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha 🤣🤣
25/09/2019, 18:46 - Bee: I always thought I'd be the cheesy one in my relationship. Apparently not
25/09/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: I love it!
25/09/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: I still think you're cheesy... I'm just trying to keep up most of the time
25/09/2019, 18:47 - Bee: Nooo you are cheesy and you don't even try
25/09/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay... I hope it isn't too much then cause I don't think I notice it every time
25/09/2019, 18:52 - Bee: It'll never be too much. I love it
25/09/2019, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: I think I'm blushing in the bus 😶
25/09/2019, 18:57 - Bee: Aww Nischal. I wish I could see
25/09/2019, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Noooo... That'd just make me blush more 🙈
25/09/2019, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
25/09/2019, 18:59 - Bee: Now I'm wishing even more Nischallllll
25/09/2019, 18:59 - Bee: Maa made biryani today. 😋 There's nothing special... She just felt like it
25/09/2019, 18:59 - Bee: I'm not complaining
25/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... I think I'm going to set my cooking goal as Biryani. I know it's not supposed to be the most difficult dish to make...
25/09/2019, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: OH! I just had an idea!!
25/09/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: I should make a cooking bucket list. Just things that I can't make now but eventually want to build up to
25/09/2019, 19:08 - Bee: That's a great idea!! You can do this, Nischal!! Make biryani, I mean. Someday
25/09/2019, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Someday. Probably... Well first I need to make a decent batch of rice
25/09/2019, 19:18 - Bee: I'm sure you will. After a few tries at least
25/09/2019, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's starting. Talk later Bee! Have a good study session
25/09/2019, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: Hey.
25/09/2019, 22:15 - Nischal Abraham: The meeting today was really good... There's a mission group called London City Mission and a member was sharing their testimony of sharing the gospel among Muslims in London
25/09/2019, 22:16 - Nischal Abraham: I realised I don't really know about gospel work happening anywhere other than India. And God is working so amazingly in so many places!! Really encouraged and challenged today
26/09/2019, 04:06 - Bee: That's so encouraging!
26/09/2019, 04:06 - Bee: Especially in a place like London
26/09/2019, 04:06 - Bee: I just looked them up and they're doing a lot of work
26/09/2019, 07:51 - Bee: My health talk went well :)
26/09/2019, 07:51 - Bee: Thank you for praying, Nischal :)

26/09/2019, 14:02 - Bee: Okay :)

27/09/2019, 11:53 - Bee: Good so far
27/09/2019, 11:53 - Bee: Good doesn't cover it
27/09/2019, 11:54 - Bee: The best day this week I think

27/09/2019, 11:55 - Bee: Did you go out yesterday?
27/09/2019, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: Well it is just starting. I tried to get up at 7 but switched off my alarm and got up at 9:30 instead. Now I'm done with oats for breakfast and going to watch a movie
27/09/2019, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: I did go out. Bought all the stuff I need for refilling kitchen supplies
27/09/2019, 11:56 - Bee: No college today?
27/09/2019, 11:57 - Bee: When's the party you'll be going to?
27/09/2019, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: No college this week. Next week lectures start. I'm skipping the party
27/09/2019, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: Instead I'll be enjoying dinner with Daniel
27/09/2019, 11:58 - Bee: Oh lectures!!
27/09/2019, 11:59 - Bee: Nice choice. Good food. Full tummy. Very important.
27/09/2019, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: And hopefully another person in Ireland I can be in touch with 😁
27/09/2019, 12:47 - Bee: Have you started watching the movie?
27/09/2019, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Na... I decided to do it after lunch otherwise I'll end up eating lunch late again
27/09/2019, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: But today is turning out to be productive too 😁. Registered for my immigration check, recharged my Forex card, found an easy recipe rice dish I could make for lunch if I manage to find soy sauce in some shop
27/09/2019, 13:44 - Bee: Did you get the soy sauce?
27/09/2019, 13:44 - Bee: That's gooooooood! I'm glad to hear that
27/09/2019, 13:44 - Bee: You got so many things done

27/09/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
27/09/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: Today's disaster
27/09/2019, 13:46 - Bee: Disaster? It looks yum
27/09/2019, 13:46 - Bee: How does it taste?
27/09/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: I call everything I make a disaster 😂
27/09/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: It's bacon egg and fried rice in soy sauce. I think I over fried my rice a bit
27/09/2019, 14:43 - Bee: I'm curious
27/09/2019, 14:47 - Bee: Also, mailing address please
27/09/2019, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: It tasted alright... The bacon was good... The egg was good. I think I forgot salt
27/09/2019, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: 72 Chambers Park, 
Kilcock, Co. Kildare
Ireland
27/09/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: It was a lovely movie. Can't really call it a romance movie... Really liked the message of it too. Just a great movie overall 😊
27/09/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Thank you
27/09/2019, 18:53 - Bee: 😃 did you listen to the song?
27/09/2019, 19:20 - Bee: I slept in the evening today as well. I'm down with fever. I'll take medicine and go back to sleep now

27/09/2019, 22:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm home now. But you're sick! Go to sleep!!
27/09/2019, 22:01 - Bee: I slept but woke yo because of a nightmare. I'm hesitant to go to sleep now
27/09/2019, 22:02 - Bee: Up*
27/09/2019, 22:02 - Nischal Abraham: Want to talk?
27/09/2019, 22:02 - Bee: Yes
27/09/2019, 22:02 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 2 min
27/09/2019, 22:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call
27/09/2019, 22:02 - Bee: Okay. Take your time
27/09/2019, 23:10 - Nischal Abraham: It was still 1 hour!?
27/09/2019, 23:10 - Bee: 😂
27/09/2019, 23:10 - Nischal Abraham: I thought this was a short conversation
27/09/2019, 23:10 - Bee: Better than 3 hours though
27/09/2019, 23:11 - Bee: It was short!!
27/09/2019, 23:11 - Nischal Abraham: It felt short :(
27/09/2019, 23:11 - Bee: Yes it did
27/09/2019, 23:11 - Bee: Because it was
27/09/2019, 23:11 - Nischal Abraham: Well anywho. Go sleep!
27/09/2019, 23:11 - Bee: I don't think I'll have nightmares tonight
27/09/2019, 23:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'd rather have 3
27/09/2019, 23:12 - Bee: Going. Bye. ☺
27/09/2019, 23:12 - Bee: ☺🤗
27/09/2019, 23:12 - Nischal Abraham: Byeeeeee ☺
28/09/2019, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I hope you're feeling better. Prayed for you this morning too. Did you go today?
28/09/2019, 11:03 - Bee: Hey! I am feeling better
28/09/2019, 11:03 - Bee: Yes I'm in college
28/09/2019, 11:04 - Bee: If I had postings I wouldn't have come
28/09/2019, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. So no walking today 😊
28/09/2019, 11:35 - Bee: Nope 😌
28/09/2019, 12:57 - Bee: What's the best gift anyone's ever given to you?
28/09/2019, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Best is a very subjective word...
28/09/2019, 12:59 - Bee: Yes. Best for you
28/09/2019, 13:00 - Nischal Abraham: But best as in the gift was most useful, or that it was the most meaningful, or it may just be because of the person who gave it to me... There's so many factors
28/09/2019, 13:00 - Nischal Abraham: And I've already told you about all my best gifts before :)
28/09/2019, 13:00 - Bee: Tell me all of them! :P
28/09/2019, 13:01 - Bee: The ukulele?
28/09/2019, 13:02 - Nischal Abraham: All of them. The ukulele, my hoody, the capo, the secret santa from Reenee
28/09/2019, 13:02 - Bee: The capo?
28/09/2019, 13:02 - Bee: I don't know about the capo
28/09/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: The first thing Nikhil ever gifted me was a guitar capo
28/09/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: And it's the one I use till today. He got it for me around the time I got my new guitar
28/09/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: So when I was in the 9th
28/09/2019, 13:04 - Bee: Oh! Nikhil?!
28/09/2019, 13:04 - Bee: I don't know Nikhil at all
28/09/2019, 13:05 - Bee: That's so sweet
28/09/2019, 13:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'd been going on and on about a capo to my mom for a while. He didn't even know if he got the right thing 😂
28/09/2019, 13:06 - Bee: Hahaha
28/09/2019, 13:06 - Bee: That's the Nikhil I know :P
28/09/2019, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: But it was sweet. I don't have one best gift that was better than the rest... To have someone who actually thought of getting me something... anything, that's enough to be a good gift for me
28/09/2019, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: You home yet?
28/09/2019, 13:15 - Bee: Nischal. I wish I could give you a hug rn.
28/09/2019, 13:15 - Bee: I got down at Lok puram. Waiting for papa. He wants to buy groceries and I thought I'd join
28/09/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... I wish I could receive said hug 😅
28/09/2019, 13:17 - Bee: I'll keep a count. And give you all of them the next time we meet
28/09/2019, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Well how are you going to give me a year of hugs in one meeting? And the moment would be gone by then
28/09/2019, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Oh Debby. Do me favour. Tell me to stop being lazy and get off my bed
28/09/2019, 13:19 - Bee: You'll see. Also, there'll be many more moments
28/09/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Get off your bed, Nischal!!!!!!
28/09/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Did you have lunch?
28/09/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. That's what I need to get out of bed for😂
28/09/2019, 13:20 - Bee: Did you out the photos up? Do that!! If you don't have any other important thing to do
28/09/2019, 13:20 - Bee: Then go!!!

28/09/2019, 13:36 - Nischal Abraham: I'll try something fancy for tonight
28/09/2019, 14:11 - Bee: How did it not get spoiled?!
28/09/2019, 14:11 - Bee: I'm leaving to meet reens and Nidhi
28/09/2019, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: It's the packed and sealed one. Expiry on it was 2022
28/09/2019, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: Oh say hi to Reen for me! Have fun!!
28/09/2019, 15:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/09/2019, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice dog
28/09/2019, 16:29 - Bee: Thanks
28/09/2019, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Parents just called... Was Nidhi surprised?
28/09/2019, 16:30 - Bee: Why would Nidhi be surprised?
28/09/2019, 16:30 - Bee: OH! I asked her what time she would be free
28/09/2019, 16:30 - Bee: Didn't want to wake her up if she was sleeping
28/09/2019, 16:31 - Bee: We went to the park near Bethany
28/09/2019, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: No I meant with Ben 😶
28/09/2019, 16:31 - Bee: Biju uncle called and told us that she doesn't know yet... nothing else
28/09/2019, 16:31 - Bee: We were supposed to meet Ben?!
28/09/2019, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool... Then I guess she's just meeting him tomorrow
28/09/2019, 16:32 - Bee: Yep
28/09/2019, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: Idk... I'm in a very far far away land
28/09/2019, 16:33 - Bee: But there's internet and whatsapp
28/09/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: All recipes for miscommunication :P
28/09/2019, 16:35 - Bee: Very very true
28/09/2019, 16:42 - Nischal Abraham: Well have fun on your walk :). I'll be going for one as well
28/09/2019, 16:42 - Bee: Reenee said 'hiiiiiii'
28/09/2019, 16:42 - Bee: I'm back home

29/09/2019, 21:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just concerned you aren't going to sleep
29/09/2019, 21:21 - Bee: I spoke to Reenee and Ruth for a while and then sat down to do my assignment
29/09/2019, 21:21 - Bee: I'll sleep now
29/09/2019, 21:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'll answer all your questions all night if I could
29/09/2019, 21:21 - Bee: I'll save those for tomorrow
29/09/2019, 21:22 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! I should talk to them soon too
29/09/2019, 21:22 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee! Missing you more everyday
29/09/2019, 21:22 - Bee: Yeah they'll love that! They always ask about you
29/09/2019, 21:23 - Bee: I miss you too, Nischal. It was very different going to your house/the youth hanging out and you not being there. I missed you a lot.
29/09/2019, 21:23 - Bee: We'll talk tomorrow hopefully
29/09/2019, 21:23 - Bee: Goodnight :)
29/09/2019, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: I hope we get to talk! Goodnight again 😅
29/09/2019, 21:24 - Bee: Yep. Going. Bye.
29/09/2019, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: Byeeeee
30/09/2019, 06:18 - Bee: Hey! Praying for you as you start classes today
30/09/2019, 06:18 - Bee: :)
30/09/2019, 07:50 - Bee: I hope you have a great day!
30/09/2019, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby! I'm getting nervous 😅. I pray you have an amazing day too!
30/09/2019, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Though by the time I send you this the day's already half done
30/09/2019, 10:25 - Bee: Still makes a difference
30/09/2019, 10:25 - Bee: How is it going so far?
30/09/2019, 10:25 - Bee: You're back to studying!! Im excited for you 😭
30/09/2019, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Late for my first lecture 😂. Well it's just the intro class so didn't really miss anything
30/09/2019, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'll have to get back into study mood. No more wasting time I could avoid wasting
30/09/2019, 14:56 - Bee: Howwwwwwww
30/09/2019, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: I was cycling. Though I chose the worst day to. Temperature dropped below 10, and it's raining
30/09/2019, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
30/09/2019, 21:05 - Bee: Hey
30/09/2019, 21:05 - Nischal Abraham: Evening nap?
30/09/2019, 21:06 - Bee: Slept for an hour and then was doing an assignment
30/09/2019, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. You're up pretty late then! Done with the assignment?
30/09/2019, 21:07 - Bee: Yes. But I don't know if I can go tomorrow... The fever is back
30/09/2019, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Did you take any medicine?
30/09/2019, 21:08 - Bee: Yes yes I did
30/09/2019, 21:09 - Nischal Abraham: You should rest. Sleep it off... You'll probably feel better in the morning
30/09/2019, 21:11 - Bee: Yes I'll do that
30/09/2019, 21:11 - Bee: Did you have dinner?
30/09/2019, 21:11 - Bee: How did your day go?
30/09/2019, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I did. My day was good... First day of lectures and it seems alright
30/09/2019, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: Need to buy some cycle maintenance stuff so tomorrow is a bus day
30/09/2019, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: Also I'll hopefully get my stitches out tomorrow
30/09/2019, 21:19 - Bee: Oh! Is it itchy?
30/09/2019, 21:20 - Bee: That's awesome!! Same timings the whole week?
30/09/2019, 21:20 - Nischal Abraham: It was a bit yesterday. It's better today... Yep same timings the whole week. You should really go to sleep though Debby. Especially since you're not well :(
30/09/2019, 21:24 - Bee: I really want to talk to you though :(. But yes I should sleep
30/09/2019, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: We'll talk... In time. When you're better :). I'm not going anywhere
30/09/2019, 21:26 - Bee: But what if it's like this the whole year?! 😔
30/09/2019, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: I hope not. Something will seriously be wrong if you have fever the whole year
30/09/2019, 21:27 - Bee: Nischal
30/09/2019, 21:27 - Bee: I'll go sleep
30/09/2019, 21:27 - Bee: Praying for you.
30/09/2019, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be fine Deb 😌. We knew how it would be
30/09/2019, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep well. I'm praying for you too!
30/09/2019, 21:28 - Bee: Doesn't make it any easier though
30/09/2019, 21:29 - Bee: Goodnight :)
30/09/2019, 21:29 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee :)
01/10/2019, 03:28 - Bee: Hey :)
01/10/2019, 03:28 - Bee: I'm all better. I'm going for the posting because I have a holiday tomorrow anyway
01/10/2019, 08:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Glad to hear it!! Don't exert yourself if you feel weak... Worst way to spend a holiday is involuntarily in bed
01/10/2019, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: Been praying for you this morning as well. I'm sure you'll be fine :). Have a great day... Whatevers left of it
01/10/2019, 13:33 - Bee: I'll try not to. I think Ben's making plans though
01/10/2019, 13:33 - Bee: Thank you ☺
01/10/2019, 13:33 - Bee: How's your day going?
01/10/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good so far. Heading to the medical centre in a while to get the stitches removed
01/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: Oh. So you're missing classes?
01/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: Are you anxious?
01/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: About the stitch removal
01/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Just hoping it's all fine. Yea I'll be missing 1lab session. But since it's the first class I'm hoping I won't miss a lot
01/10/2019, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like more fun in missing :P
01/10/2019, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'm *
01/10/2019, 14:03 - Bee: But you're getting the stitches removed! I'm sure that's more fun :P
01/10/2019, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: Of course! Can't wait to do it again 😒
01/10/2019, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: How are you feeling? Still got fever?
01/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: 😂
01/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: I'm okay. No fever since early morning
01/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: I still haven't reached home 😓 I don't think I'll make it in time for the prayer meeting
01/10/2019, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Got late today?
01/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: Also, no sleepover with the kids. I don't want them to fall sick. Anjali has exams next week
01/10/2019, 14:35 - Bee: Yes. And there's this special Navratri thing near the station so there was a lot of traffic
01/10/2019, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's sad :(. But I guess it's for the best... You can hang out with Ben now maybe!
01/10/2019, 14:36 - Bee: Yes! And there's a holiday next week as well
01/10/2019, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: I FOUND SOY SAUCE!! Today dinner will be a bit tastier 😁
01/10/2019, 14:37 - Bee: OH!!! What are you making?
01/10/2019, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Still haven't been able to find mustard seeds though... Quiet unfortunate this country doesn't have a lot of it
01/10/2019, 14:37 - Bee: Is it the mushroom and chicken dish but with soy sauce?
01/10/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yes how did you know? 😅
01/10/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's still some chicken that hasn't been cooked yet... So I'll just use that today. And it makes enough for 2-3 servings so I can store it and keep
01/10/2019, 14:38 - Bee: You told me 🙄
01/10/2019, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: But I didn't tell you I'm making it today...
01/10/2019, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sitting in a mall in Maynooth right now. Nothing as good as Thane malls though
01/10/2019, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: Also everything's so pricey... Well I'ma start walking to the medical centre. Hoping we can talk tonight!
01/10/2019, 15:21 - Bee: I had a feeling :P really.
01/10/2019, 15:22 - Bee: There's something good in thane then 😂
01/10/2019, 15:22 - Bee: We will.
01/10/2019, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: Ngl stitches look really cool
01/10/2019, 15:33 - Bee: What's ngl?
01/10/2019, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: Turns out it might be too early to remove them so the doc said to come back on Friday to get them off
01/10/2019, 15:33 - Bee: Did you take a photo?
01/10/2019, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: Not gonna lie
01/10/2019, 15:33 - Bee: Oh
01/10/2019, 15:33 - Bee: 😶
Didn't know that
01/10/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: I wanted to but I thought about a photo only after she bandaged it again
01/10/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Oh
01/10/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Does it hurt? Or just itchy?
01/10/2019, 15:35 - Bee: We aren't going out. Just meeting at Reenee's
01/10/2019, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Neither actually... It feels fine. Just the bandage pulling on the hair on my hand is annoying :P
01/10/2019, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Tomorrow?
01/10/2019, 15:35 - Bee: Oh it's an adhesive?
01/10/2019, 15:35 - Bee: No tonight
01/10/2019, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Sorry I don't know the accurate term for it 😂. I'll take a pic when I'm home
01/10/2019, 15:36 - Bee: What did she say? Is it healing well?
01/10/2019, 15:36 - Bee: 😂
01/10/2019, 15:36 - Bee: No problem
01/10/2019, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it looks fine. Must've been a deep cut. She just said for the hand it's better to wait 10-14 days and it's only been 9
01/10/2019, 15:39 - Bee: Oh good
01/10/2019, 15:39 - Bee: On your way home?
01/10/2019, 15:39 - Bee: I try not to ask too many questions but I end up asking too many questions
01/10/2019, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: I don't mind answering questions... One of us needs to carry the conversation
01/10/2019, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Waiting for the bus
01/10/2019, 17:07 - Bee: I'll do that
01/10/2019, 17:08 - Bee: I'm here
01/10/2019, 17:08 - Bee: We got excited and bought alcohol 😶
01/10/2019, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm here too. Except my here is home
01/10/2019, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: And I got excited and bought muffins
01/10/2019, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Worth every penny 😋
01/10/2019, 17:10 - Bee: 🤩
01/10/2019, 17:10 - Bee: You should learn how to bake!
01/10/2019, 17:10 - Bee: It'll be good for me. I always burn brownies.
01/10/2019, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... Many days down the line. Cooking is essential, baking is just a want
01/10/2019, 17:27 - Bee: You can make meals right
01/10/2019, 17:28 - Bee: Ben knows so many good combos Nischal
01/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: I do aight. Don't know a lot still.
01/10/2019, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe I should ask him for tips someday
01/10/2019, 18:01 - Bee: Cocktails yes
01/10/2019, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: OH! You meant drink combos!! I thought you meant food combos
01/10/2019, 18:36 - Bee: Food combos work too
01/10/2019, 18:36 - Bee: What's for dinner tonight?
01/10/2019, 18:36 - Bee: ?
01/10/2019, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it's still that for dinner... I've got carrots to add in there too
01/10/2019, 19:10 - Bee: Ahh
01/10/2019, 19:10 - Bee: Reenee made noodles
01/10/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Maggi?
01/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: No no
01/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: The fancy ones
01/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: With soy sauce and veggies
01/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh... Nice! I'm getting tired of Maggi already and I've only had it like twice 😂
01/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
01/10/2019, 20:24 - Bee: It looks good!
01/10/2019, 20:24 - Bee: I mean the bandage isn't as bad as the earlier one. Less intimidating
01/10/2019, 20:25 - Bee: Dinner done?
01/10/2019, 20:25 - Nischal Abraham: Yes, yes and yes
01/10/2019, 20:25 - Bee: :)
01/10/2019, 20:25 - Bee: How was your day?
01/10/2019, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: Not too bad if I should say so myself... Second attempt at cooking the same dish turned out to be a success too. Doesn't taste any better but it isn't worse :P
01/10/2019, 20:27 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day? Are you back home? Or staying over?
01/10/2019, 20:27 - Bee: You added soy sauce? I'm sure it tastes better!
01/10/2019, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: I did add soy sauce. But I minused the garlic bread seasoning since I wanted it to have more of its own flavour
01/10/2019, 20:29 - Nischal Abraham: And I discovered my favourite part about cooking 😁... It's the smell of the food just as it's getting done... Oh heavenly
01/10/2019, 20:40 - Bee: It was good 😌 I'm glad I went to work. I had a fun time in the evening. Danced my heart out with Ben and reens. Drank! Ben really knows his drinks
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Bee: I'll be staying over. Ben too
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Bee: Arpitha has gone home
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Bee: I'll be up for a while
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Bee: When are you going to sleep?
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Bee: Are you sleepy?
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: It's only 8:40 here :P
01/10/2019, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably be up till 11
01/10/2019, 20:46 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you had fun! ☺️ . Is Rolf with you guys or did he enjoy solitude?
01/10/2019, 20:47 - Bee: I'll be up
01/10/2019, 20:48 - Bee: We did 😌
01/10/2019, 20:48 - Bee: We're doing questions now
01/10/2019, 20:48 - Bee: Rolf is in his room. He just said hi and went
01/10/2019, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy yourselves! Predicted temperature for tonight is 2 degrees so I'm wrapped up in two layers and socks
01/10/2019, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'm guessing Arpitha is working tomorrow too
01/10/2019, 20:49 - Bee: WHAT!!! That's baaadddd
01/10/2019, 20:50 - Bee: No she has a holiday
01/10/2019, 20:50 - Bee: She wanted to sleep early and sleep in
01/10/2019, 20:50 - Bee: 2 degrees!!
01/10/2019, 20:50 - Bee: 😭
01/10/2019, 20:50 - Bee: Are you using your thick jacket? The one you didn't have to use at all?
01/10/2019, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's bound to happen eventually. The sooner it does the earlier I'll get used to it
01/10/2019, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: While going to college I have to. These last two days have been really chilly. I'll explain my clothing decisions when we talk :P
01/10/2019, 20:53 - Bee: 😂 alright.
01/10/2019, 20:54 - Bee: We're eating Maggi now 😌
I'm going to go back to this night very often
01/10/2019, 20:54 - Bee: Missing you, Nischal.
01/10/2019, 20:55 - Nischal Abraham: You'll miss out on your night if you spend it all missing me :P. Live in the moment!
01/10/2019, 20:55 - Nischal Abraham: P.s. I'm missing you too
01/10/2019, 21:16 - Bee: I can multitask :P
01/10/2019, 21:18 - Nischal Abraham: I know you can. Like I said, I'm not going anywhere
01/10/2019, 21:43 - Bee: And I thank God for that.
01/10/2019, 22:13 - Bee: Hey
01/10/2019, 22:13 - Nischal Abraham: Sup
01/10/2019, 22:13 - Bee: What time are you going to sleep?
01/10/2019, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: Soon... Why what up?
01/10/2019, 22:14 - Bee: Oh
01/10/2019, 22:14 - Bee: Call I call? Just for a few minutes
01/10/2019, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'm surprised you aren't asleep! Isn't it pretty late?
01/10/2019, 22:14 - Bee: It is
01/10/2019, 22:14 - Bee: We were talking
01/10/2019, 22:15 - Nischal Abraham: Yes please
01/10/2019, 23:55 - Nischal Abraham: I enjoyed our "few" minutes of talk :). I completely forgot to say goodnight. So whenever you see this... Goodnight bee
02/10/2019, 07:59 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope you slept in and only read this message hours later. Have a wonderful holiday!!
02/10/2019, 08:04 - Bee: Nischal!! :)
02/10/2019, 08:05 - Bee: Good morning!
02/10/2019, 08:05 - Bee: I slept in
02/10/2019, 08:05 - Bee: 🤗
02/10/2019, 08:06 - Bee: Rolf Reenee arpitha and I are out for lunch
02/10/2019, 08:06 - Bee: We just left
02/10/2019, 08:06 - Bee: Reenee and I are making it awkward for them
02/10/2019, 08:06 - Bee: :P
02/10/2019, 08:06 - Bee: I hope you have a great day, Nischal! :)
02/10/2019, 08:06 - Bee: After you were going to finish what you were telling me, I was going to say goodnight just in case the phone went off. But then the phone went off.
02/10/2019, 08:16 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Lunch... Where are you going? Ben didn't tag along?
02/10/2019, 08:38 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like your phone decided there was enough talking :P
02/10/2019, 08:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm waiting for the bus to college... It is so cold I can see my every breath. Also can't keep my hands out of my pocket longer than a few seconds 😂
02/10/2019, 08:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
02/10/2019, 09:19 - Bee: No he had plans. We're in this place near Siby Aunty's place. It's called Vanilla and Co
02/10/2019, 09:37 - Bee: 😂. Somebody has to keep a track of time
02/10/2019, 09:38 - Bee: This looks so comfy!!
02/10/2019, 09:38 - Bee: And you took a selfie!
02/10/2019, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: Never heard of the place. Thane is changing 😭. And despite how comfy it looks it felt like it wasn't enough. My face was frozen :P
02/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: That eatery has been there for a year. Didn't you carry that scarf?
02/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: I had my afternoon nap. I'm no longer sleep deprived
02/10/2019, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Well clearly I haven't explored Thane then. It's good you're rested and well. Will you be going to Amaresh uncle's place?
02/10/2019, 14:30 - Bee: Yes I'm on my way. Prachi didi said 7 works for them
02/10/2019, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Don't get her sick :P. Good day today. On my way home now... I love postgraduate lab sessions 😂
02/10/2019, 16:53 - Bee: Just came back home. Didn't realise how quickly time passed!
02/10/2019, 16:53 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: I'm refreshed... spending time with them 😌
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Just came back home too! Is that Ashish?
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: They play so well!
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: Yes
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: Anjali played too
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: And then there were many riddles an rounds of I spy
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: And*
02/10/2019, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... Sounds like an amazing time 😊
02/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: Hide and seek also
02/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: I had an amazing time!!
02/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: Yeah :)
02/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: Is that the geek in you
02/10/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: No it's more of being allowed to leave an hour and a half early because there's no fixed lecture end time as such
02/10/2019, 17:13 - Bee: Whoa that's good!! What time did you reach home then?
02/10/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: .
02/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: Oh
02/10/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: Took the bus right? So easy travels. Then I shopped a bit and came back
02/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: Oh. Groceries? Or the spoon kug stuff
02/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: Mug*
02/10/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: Groceries... Still need to buy the other stuff. The problem is groceries are so heavy that I can't really carry anything else
02/10/2019, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: And I'm one handed on top of that so that limits my capacity
02/10/2019, 17:16 - Bee: Backpack?
02/10/2019, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Groceries will get squashed in the bag 😮. I have a cloth bag
02/10/2019, 17:18 - Bee: 😶 yep. Silly question
02/10/2019, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Na... I usually do just stuff everything into my bag. But since this was in town and walking distance I just put things in the cloth bag
02/10/2019, 17:27 - Bee: One awful thing happened today. Arpitha had a breakdown because of something that I said.
02/10/2019, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: No way!... I thought she was doing fine for so long
02/10/2019, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Was everyone alright after? How bad was it?
02/10/2019, 17:30 - Bee: Yeah. She apologized later. We were eating while it happened. Rolf took her out until she calmed down. But I was just joking Nischal. Like I do with everyone else
02/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: It's not your fault Debby! Don't worry about it :)
02/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure there's a lot going on behind the scenes that we don't know about.
02/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: If only it was that easy
02/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: Yes she said that as well
02/10/2019, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: It's never just one thing that affects her... It's usually a build up
02/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: She explained. It was because of all the things I did it didn't do since she came to Thane
02/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: Or*
02/10/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: She said it was your fault?
02/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: Directly no
02/10/2019, 17:35 - Bee: Please don't ask her about it
02/10/2019, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: I won't. She'll probably end up telling me if I talk to her though. Are you okay?
02/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: I'll be okay. Maybe not right now
02/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: She just sent a long message and apologized
02/10/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Hey... You had a good time with the kids. Don't put yourself down
02/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: I have forgiven her. But it's all very clear in my head. I keep replaying it. I'll need some time
02/10/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. But if you want to talk I'm always here for you
02/10/2019, 17:55 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. Pray for me, please.
02/10/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: I am
02/10/2019, 17:55 - Bee: :)
02/10/2019, 18:29 - Bee: One of the things she said after the whole thing was that she thinks I'm friends with her just because I like you. But it's not like that Nischal. I'm not like that. I don't have any ulterior motive
02/10/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: I know
02/10/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: If she said it during her breakdown then you have to understand she doesn't mean a lot of what she says
02/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby. Are you okay? I know I should give you time to deal with it in your own way but I'm worried :(. Just tell me you'll be fine
02/10/2019, 20:45 - Bee: She said it after her breakdown. And she has mentioned it to Reenee earlier
02/10/2019, 20:46 - Bee: Hey. I'm not okay. But I will be
02/10/2019, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry to hear that
02/10/2019, 20:57 - Bee: :(
02/10/2019, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad to hear this. Won't you be going tomorrow?
02/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: No... I don't have the strength
02/10/2019, 21:25 - Bee: Did you have dinner?
02/10/2019, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. A while back
02/10/2019, 21:27 - Bee: Oh
02/10/2019, 21:28 - Bee: Can I talk to you?
02/10/2019, 22:01 - Nischal Abraham: Sleeping?
02/10/2019, 23:11 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
02/10/2019, 23:13 - Bee: 🤦🏻‍♀
02/10/2019, 23:13 - Bee: At least one of us finds it funny
02/10/2019, 23:14 - Nischal Abraham: Who are you talking to so late on the phone 🤔
02/10/2019, 23:14 - Bee: Oh your heard that
02/10/2019, 23:14 - Bee: 😂
02/10/2019, 23:15 - Nischal Abraham: It's the same line from last time so easy to remember
02/10/2019, 23:15 - Bee: 😂
02/10/2019, 23:15 - Bee: I don't remember that
02/10/2019, 23:16 - Bee: I told him that there's a person
02/10/2019, 23:16 - Nischal Abraham: Well now you get to see Jason yayy! And you can get up at the same time he does:P
02/10/2019, 23:16 - Bee: And that I'll tell him when I want to
02/10/2019, 23:17 - Bee: He didn't expect me to admit it. He was shocked :P
02/10/2019, 23:17 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's a mature response... When my mom caught me on the phone late I'd just deny it so badly that even I wouldn't believe me
02/10/2019, 23:17 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly!!
02/10/2019, 23:17 - Bee: 😂
02/10/2019, 23:17 - Bee: Jason has been there so he'll know I'm lying
02/10/2019, 23:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yea everyone knew I was lying... Didn't stop me from trying though 😂
02/10/2019, 23:18 - Bee: Hahaha
02/10/2019, 23:18 - Bee: Oh Nischal
02/10/2019, 23:18 - Bee: You should sleep!
02/10/2019, 23:19 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm happy you're happy :). I'll be fine btw... 7 hours of sleep is plenty!
02/10/2019, 23:19 - Nischal Abraham: Also this week is the lightest of lectures... I was gonna talk to you about my lecs but the timing didn't seem right. Maybe next time
02/10/2019, 23:20 - Bee: I am. I feel much better now
02/10/2019, 23:20 - Nischal Abraham: Thank Jason for that
02/10/2019, 23:20 - Bee: Okay! Tomorrow
02/10/2019, 23:20 - Bee: 🔫
02/10/2019, 23:20 - Bee: Thank you for that
02/10/2019, 23:21 - Nischal Abraham: For what? I didn't do anything
02/10/2019, 23:21 - Bee: Oh but you did
02/10/2019, 23:22 - Nischal Abraham: Well whatever you're better and that's all that matters 😌. I'm not naive btw... I know it'll take longer. But try and get some sleep. Clear your head a bit
02/10/2019, 23:23 - Bee: I'm not hysterical anymore. I am much better. And you helped me take my mind off for a while
02/10/2019, 23:23 - Bee: Yes it'll take longer
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Bee: I'll be okay
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Bee: Praying about the Jake situation
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying!
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Bee: :)
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Nischal Abraham: :P
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Nischal Abraham: Night bee
02/10/2019, 23:24 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal. :) 🤗
02/10/2019, 23:31 - Bee: I thank God for you. Just reminding you.
03/10/2019, 06:36 - Bee: Hey you :)
03/10/2019, 06:36 - Bee: Good morning!
03/10/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hiii ☺. Good morning! Or afternoon!
03/10/2019, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: Everytime I think I understand the story of Job I end up rereading it and it's the most bizarre thing I've ever read. I'm amazed by God's word written so many thousands of years ago still holds relevant to life today...
03/10/2019, 07:57 - Nischal Abraham: Well I've found an answer to one prayer. I've got a fixed book set to study now. So Job, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes it is
03/10/2019, 09:16 - Bee: Maybe that's why it's called the Living word. It is always so apt
03/10/2019, 09:16 - Bee: Treasures! I'm sure you'll not be the same after you finish
03/10/2019, 09:16 - Bee: I'm having a good day so far
03/10/2019, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear :). My day hasn't started yet... Lectures have been pushed to 11 because the lab wasn't free so now I'm just waiting around for an hour
03/10/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Will you have to stay back?
03/10/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Since it's later than usual
03/10/2019, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: No no... In fact he said he'll let us off by 2. Did I tell you I love postgraduate labs?
03/10/2019, 12:25 - Bee: 😂
03/10/2019, 12:25 - Bee: I love postgraduate labs and I don't even attend them :P
03/10/2019, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: So he let us off by 1:30. I'm going to check out the clubs in college today
03/10/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
03/10/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
03/10/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
03/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: This looks exciting!!
03/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Anything that grabbed your attention?
03/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Did you join any club?
03/10/2019, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Well I was planning on joining the Christian Union anyway... Then I joined the rock climbing club and the gaming club
03/10/2019, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Turns out gaming includes board games and they play something every week!!
03/10/2019, 17:24 - Bee: Free pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!
03/10/2019, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Yea a lot of the orientations have free pizza 😂😂
03/10/2019, 17:25 - Bee: 😋
03/10/2019, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: They have their AGM meetings next week. I don't know why but I decided against football
03/10/2019, 17:26 - Bee: Can you join football later?
03/10/2019, 17:26 - Bee: Your injury will heal by then
03/10/2019, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... I can join later... It wasn't for the injury that I didn't join though. It's more the thought of I won't have time... Also I got really excited about rock climbing!
03/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Rock climbing sounds fun!!!
03/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: I hope it won't be too cold though
03/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Or will it be indoors?
03/10/2019, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: It's indoors
03/10/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: So what did you do all day?
03/10/2019, 18:52 - Bee: I slept in. Had my quiet time. Organized my clothes and books cupboards. Watched a movie. Fried fryums. Took a long long bath. Went for the Bible study. Hung out with reens for a while after the Bible study. And watched one episode of B-99. It was a good day. :)
03/10/2019, 18:53 - Bee: And I lit a scented candle the whole day! 😌
03/10/2019, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like an awesome day! I'm making a breakfast dish for dinner :P
03/10/2019, 18:56 - Bee: What are you making?
03/10/2019, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Fried rice eggs and bacon
03/10/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
03/10/2019, 19:18 - Bee: Looks like the rice is cooked perfectly
03/10/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
03/10/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: I used leftover rice to fry. Read that it fries better than freshly made rice
03/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: How does it taste?
03/10/2019, 21:04 - Bee: I was talking to Ruth and Reenee
03/10/2019, 21:33 - Nischal Abraham: Tasted good 😊
03/10/2019, 21:34 - Nischal Abraham: That's a long conversation 😮. I thought you went off to sleep already since you must be going tomorrow
03/10/2019, 21:36 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/vGZXl7GGjPA
03/10/2019, 21:36 - Bee: We were still talking :P
03/10/2019, 21:36 - Bee: Just cut the call
03/10/2019, 21:36 - Bee: Yes I'm going tomorrow
03/10/2019, 21:36 - Nischal Abraham: I don't understand a word but this put a smile on my face 😋
03/10/2019, 21:37 - Bee: Listening to it
03/10/2019, 21:37 - Nischal Abraham: Noo{
03/10/2019, 21:37 - Nischal Abraham: You should be sleeping 😂
03/10/2019, 21:38 - Bee: Yes. Didn't understand the first few seconds. I'll give it a listen tomorrow
03/10/2019, 21:38 - Nischal Abraham: Cause it's Korean
03/10/2019, 21:38 - Bee: Yes and the video also
03/10/2019, 21:38 - Bee: Maybe because I don't understand the lyrics
03/10/2019, 21:38 - Bee: Do you listen to Korean music?
03/10/2019, 21:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it's random. But the combination of their singing and the video and I guess mainly the guitar... Well anyway you can check it out in your time
03/10/2019, 21:39 - Bee: I will
03/10/2019, 21:39 - Bee: Going to sleep now
03/10/2019, 21:40 - Bee: Can't keep my eyes open
03/10/2019, 21:40 - Nischal Abraham: I've listened to a lot of regional music... There's a lot of emotion that can be put forth regardless of language
03/10/2019, 21:40 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep sleep
03/10/2019, 21:40 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby :). I'm glad you had a good day
03/10/2019, 21:41 - Bee: I know you've been praying. Thank you.
03/10/2019, 21:41 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal :)
03/10/2019, 21:42 - Bee: You're very special. Bye.
03/10/2019, 21:43 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. Thank you
04/10/2019, 07:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hey you. Good morning! For the next few minutes before it's Good noon!
04/10/2019, 07:19 - Nischal Abraham: I pray you had a good night's sleep and have an amazing day today 😊
04/10/2019, 07:21 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. ☺
04/10/2019, 07:22 - Bee: I did. And my day has been great so far
04/10/2019, 07:22 - Bee: I hope you have an amazing day as well...a productive day
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Bee: How's your hand?
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Bee: Did you sleep well?
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Bee: What's for breakfast?
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Nischal Abraham: Stitches come off today
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Nischal Abraham: I did sleep very very well actually. I dreamt nearly 3 dreams
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Bee: You remember?!
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Nischal Abraham: Though I only remember one moment from one of them now
04/10/2019, 07:23 - Bee: Ahh
04/10/2019, 07:24 - Nischal Abraham: I should write it down because in an hour or two I'll forget that too
04/10/2019, 07:24 - Bee: I never remember my dreams. Inles they're nightmares
04/10/2019, 07:24 - Bee: Unless* 🤦🏻‍♀
04/10/2019, 07:24 - Bee: Oh you write down your dreams as well?
04/10/2019, 07:24 - Nischal Abraham: That's usually the case. Sometimes I force myself to write down the good ones when I remember
04/10/2019, 07:25 - Nischal Abraham: Sometimes... If it's worth writing about
04/10/2019, 07:25 - Nischal Abraham: Bread mayonnaise and eggs
04/10/2019, 07:25 - Bee: I want to know about these dreams! The next time we talk
04/10/2019, 07:26 - Nischal Abraham: Next time we talk :). Well I'll be off to get ready. Enjoy your amazing day!
04/10/2019, 07:26 - Bee: You too, Nischal. :)
04/10/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going?
04/10/2019, 15:01 - Bee: It's been great so far :)
04/10/2019, 15:01 - Bee: Going for a walk now
04/10/2019, 15:01 - Bee: How's your day going?
04/10/2019, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: Not going for a walk now
04/10/2019, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: I think I found the toughest subject for my course
04/10/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: The stitches are out! But I've got an even bigger dressing for the next 4 days now 😂
04/10/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
04/10/2019, 17:23 - Bee: What is it called?
04/10/2019, 17:24 - Bee: Woohooo! Was the pain bearable?
04/10/2019, 17:24 - Bee: Why did they stop at this. They should've put a cast :P
04/10/2019, 17:36 - Bee: I'm going to take a nap.. I'll wake up and work on my assignment
04/10/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Can't keep my eyes open
04/10/2019, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Cryptography
04/10/2019, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... It was like pulling a scab off an unhealed wound
04/10/2019, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: He wanted me to keep the thumb straight as it hasn't healed fully. I'll explain when we talk next
04/10/2019, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: You've been sleeping late for two days it's no wonder. Goodnight!
04/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: 🙄
04/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: Okay :)
04/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: I plan on waking up before you fall asleep but in case I don't, goodnight. ☺
04/10/2019, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably sleep late today anyway since tomorrow is Saturday
04/10/2019, 21:47 - Bee: I'm awake! 😌
04/10/2019, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: Woah. I was just thinking about messaging you
04/10/2019, 21:48 - Bee: Are you going to sleep?
04/10/2019, 21:48 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. It's only 9:50
04/10/2019, 21:48 - Bee: Olay
04/10/2019, 21:48 - Bee: Okay*
04/10/2019, 21:48 - Bee: Can I call you in 10?
04/10/2019, 21:49 - Nischal Abraham: You call me whenever you can I'll be happy to pick up :)
04/10/2019, 21:49 - Bee: :)
04/10/2019, 23:15 - Nischal Abraham: Okay I did say whenever so my bad... But now I'm falling asleep so let's talk tomorrow :P
04/10/2019, 23:55 - Bee: My fault
04/10/2019, 23:57 - Bee: I'm very sorry you had to stay awake and I kept you waiting :(
05/10/2019, 00:03 - Bee: I'm sorry
05/10/2019, 02:20 - Bee: I wasted a perfect opportunity to talk
05/10/2019, 03:16 - Bee: I'm done with the self pity. :P
05/10/2019, 03:17 - Bee: But I really wanted to talk
05/10/2019, 03:17 - Bee: Okay now I'm done
05/10/2019, 03:17 - Bee: Good morning!! :)
05/10/2019, 03:17 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
05/10/2019, 08:01 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning!! 😊. Plans for today is to cook something new, finish up homework for the week, trim my beard, change my sheets,  fix up my cycle, and hopefully talk to you
05/10/2019, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: Did you even sleep after waking up in the middle of the night? 😮. How do you manage with so little sleep!!
05/10/2019, 08:19 - Bee: That's the thing. I fell asleep. I thought I would work on my assignment for a bit and then I decided to take a 'power nap' which has never worked for me before because I just sleep for hours and that's what happened
05/10/2019, 08:21 - Bee: Sounds like you have a busy day ahead
05/10/2019, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I think the talking part takes up a chunk of the time
05/10/2019, 09:16 - Bee: Oh that thought never crossed my mind. It was more of me wanting to be a little more responsible. Now that I think of it it sounds funny
05/10/2019, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: I was making a joke... So this is what happens right... I list all these things down in my todo but maybe get 40-50% of it done. I'm not always as productive as my list makes me out to be
05/10/2019, 09:25 - Bee: Oh. Sorry :P
05/10/2019, 09:25 - Bee: It will :P
05/10/2019, 09:26 - Bee: How many items have you finished?
05/10/2019, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: 0 so far. I'm eating breakfast. Everything starts after
05/10/2019, 10:51 - Bee: And now?
05/10/2019, 10:51 - Bee: Priya has come home!! I hope o reach in time. I really want to meet her
05/10/2019, 11:00 - Bee: I*
05/10/2019, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: I guess its at 1. I decided what to make for lunch. Need to go buy stuff for that. Who's Priya?
05/10/2019, 11:02 - Bee: Priya is Jason's girlfriend
05/10/2019, 11:04 - Nischal Abraham: OH! Of course! Sorry I'm bad with names :(. That's awesome!! But what time will you be reaching home?
05/10/2019, 11:56 - Bee: No big deal. I should reach by 6:15
05/10/2019, 11:56 - Bee: Unless there's traffic
05/10/2019, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you get to meet her. Is this the first time you're meeting her face to face?
05/10/2019, 12:18 - Bee: No we've hung out a few times. With Jason there of course
05/10/2019, 12:18 - Bee: I think I'll reach in time
05/10/2019, 12:18 - Bee: What's up?
05/10/2019, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: Just be being lazy... It is terribly cold and I can't stop shivering outside my duvet
05/10/2019, 13:04 - Bee: Oh no! Is it the coldest it has been so far?
05/10/2019, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Not really... I just think it's cause I'm indoors. And our home heating isn't working
05/10/2019, 13:32 - Bee: Exercise!!
05/10/2019, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: 😶
05/10/2019, 15:01 - Bee: Coming from someone who hasn't exercised in who knows how long
05/10/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: No that's not why I'm shocked
05/10/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: Debby
05/10/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: I wasted an hour doing nothing when I could've just eaten lunch
05/10/2019, 15:03 - Bee: You haven't eaten yet?
05/10/2019, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: Just eating now
05/10/2019, 15:57 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/10/2019, 15:57 - Bee: Prachi didi made pani puri and invited me over
05/10/2019, 15:57 - Bee: 😋
05/10/2019, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Woah!! Pani Puri!!! 😢. I miss Indian chaat
05/10/2019, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Even though I never really had it while I was there anyway
05/10/2019, 16:34 - Bee: Hey
05/10/2019, 16:35 - Bee: Are you occupied?
05/10/2019, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
05/10/2019, 16:35 - Bee: Can I call you?
05/10/2019, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: You may
05/10/2019, 16:35 - Bee: *May fiiiinnneee
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: Hey
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: I'll go upstairs
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: Maa called
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: You probably should. It is 10
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: I'll call you later?
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: Yep
05/10/2019, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing :)
05/10/2019, 17:35 - Bee: :)
05/10/2019, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: But tomorrow is Sunday so don't stay up late
05/10/2019, 18:30 - Bee: N
05/10/2019, 18:30 - Bee: ☺
05/10/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
05/10/2019, 18:31 - Bee: .
06/10/2019, 09:14 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :)
06/10/2019, 09:15 - Bee: Hope you have a fulfilling time of worship ☺
06/10/2019, 09:15 - Bee: The family hour activity today was so good! I'll tell you about it when we talk
06/10/2019, 09:19 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I hope so too
06/10/2019, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: I've been praying about it and I really hope I won't be judgemental of others regardless of how worship is
06/10/2019, 09:34 - Bee: I've been praying as well.
06/10/2019, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: I know :). Thanks Debs. It's a good thing worship time is so late cause the bus is never on time 😅
06/10/2019, 09:40 - Bee: :)
06/10/2019, 09:40 - Bee: So you won't be late how worship
06/10/2019, 09:40 - Bee: It's my Sunday afternoon nap time. 😌
06/10/2019, 09:41 - Bee: Sunday afternoons know that they are Sunday afternoons. It's so different than the rest of the week
06/10/2019, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha ... No Sunday school today?
06/10/2019, 09:52 - Nischal Abraham: Well either way enjoy your siesta. Hope to talk to you later
06/10/2019, 11:41 - Bee: There is Sunday school. Leaving now
06/10/2019, 18:25 - Bee: Hey you :)
06/10/2019, 18:25 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
06/10/2019, 18:25 - Bee: Missing you!
06/10/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!! My day's been good. Talking to my parents right now
06/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Okay!
06/10/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: How has your day been?
06/10/2019, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Done talking to my parents. What was for dinner?
06/10/2019, 19:11 - Bee: It was a good day. :)
06/10/2019, 19:12 - Bee: Dinner was at Twisties with Reenee and Ben some pasta, fries, and salad
06/10/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice! So I hear you've got a holiday on Tuesday?
06/10/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Yes. Concerning Nidhis project I'm guessing
06/10/2019, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Is the holiday granted for Nidhi's project? :P
06/10/2019, 19:14 - Bee: I think I made a mistake because it's too early and she's stressing about completing the design before that
06/10/2019, 19:15 - Bee: 😂 I'd love to spend it doing that though
06/10/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ah it's alright. If she can't complete it then at least she tried
06/10/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Yeah
06/10/2019, 19:15 - Bee: She said the same thing
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure she'd enjoy having you all  there regardless
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: But she won't get work done
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Are you back home?
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: What's for dinner?
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Too early for dinner?
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: I've been home for a long while now. Made lunch for myself
06/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Too early.
06/10/2019, 19:17 - Bee: Oh!!
06/10/2019, 19:17 - Bee: How did worship go?
06/10/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: There's still time for dinner. Jake said he wants to make me dinner again
06/10/2019, 19:17 - Bee: Oh! How was yesterday's dinner?
06/10/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: The meeting was alright... There wasn't really any worship though
06/10/2019, 19:18 - Bee: Oh. Dancing and stuff?
06/10/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: Not bad. He made noodles.... Tastes better than most things I make
06/10/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: No no 😂. I meant that the only worship was songs... Everything was on a time table and I guess the message was alright
06/10/2019, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: They only have breaking of bread once a month, which happened to be today
06/10/2019, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: I met some really lovely people but I won't be attending here on the regular. I've decided on joining Fairview
06/10/2019, 19:31 - Bee: :P like that. Okay
06/10/2019, 19:31 - Bee: That's good news! You found an assembly
06/10/2019, 19:31 - Bee: I'll cross it off my list
06/10/2019, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: 😊
06/10/2019, 19:32 - Bee: Did your speak to Cherian?
06/10/2019, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: No... I'll call him tomorrow. I had other things on my list today
06/10/2019, 19:32 - Bee: Like what?
06/10/2019, 19:32 - Bee: If you don't mind telling me
06/10/2019, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Burning rice
06/10/2019, 19:33 - Bee: Just one of those days where I have a lot of questions
06/10/2019, 19:33 - Bee: Lunch?
06/10/2019, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Well it wasn't there before but ended up that way
06/10/2019, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
06/10/2019, 19:34 - Bee: Did you make something else? Or you had the burnt rice
06/10/2019, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: I tried to fry potatoes as well but that turned out just okay. Fairly mediocre cooking day... And it took me so long too :/
06/10/2019, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up having lunch at 3:30
06/10/2019, 19:35 - Bee: Hey you're a beginner! Ofc you'll take time
06/10/2019, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: So I had enough rice that wasn't burnt... But I had to clean my pot that was burnt
06/10/2019, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: Oh definitely... I'm happy with today! I'm glad I didn't end up making ready made pasta
06/10/2019, 19:36 - Bee: Good! You can meal prep your lunches
06/10/2019, 19:37 - Bee: Ahh. I hate it when that happens
06/10/2019, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Every time I talk to my parents I get new recipes for quick meals 😅
06/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: If only you could make all of them
06/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Someday... Recipes online have waaay too many little ingredients in them
06/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: And I haven't figured out how to use the oven yet
06/10/2019, 19:40 - Bee: Writing them down may be helpful
06/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: So I can only make pan fried or cooker stuff
06/10/2019, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I thought about that... Was being really lazy about it though
06/10/2019, 19:41 - Bee: Use the brown notebook
06/10/2019, 19:42 - Bee: Oh!! That's this potato dish I had on Wednesday which I think was baked. It didn't have a lot of ingredients but tasted good! I'll check for a recipe
06/10/2019, 19:42 - Bee: There's*
06/10/2019, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Does it require an oven?
06/10/2019, 19:45 - Bee: Yes it looked like it was baked
06/10/2019, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Share away. Though I'll only be able to make it after unlocking use of oven as a skill :P
06/10/2019, 19:47 - Bee: 😂
06/10/2019, 19:47 - Bee: You'll get there
06/10/2019, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I know. How's your day planned tomorrow?
06/10/2019, 19:49 - Bee: Community postings tomorrow. And if Nidhi is done with the design then I'll go help. Otherwise there's nothing planned
06/10/2019, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no college?
06/10/2019, 19:55 - Bee: No college tomorrow
06/10/2019, 20:02 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice 😁. Not going to sleep?
06/10/2019, 20:08 - Bee: In a few
06/10/2019, 20:09 - Bee: Are you okay? Generally. Also with the whole Jake thing.
Just checking in
06/10/2019, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: For the most part everything's fine now
06/10/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: Would've want to give you more reason for worry 😁
06/10/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: Wouldn't*
06/10/2019, 20:14 - Nischal Abraham: Having German sausage for dinner. This thing is HUGE
06/10/2019, 20:15 - Bee: If you say so.
06/10/2019, 20:16 - Bee: I'm here if you want to talk or pray about it. Anytime. Please remember that
06/10/2019, 20:16 - Bee: Is it tasty?!
06/10/2019, 20:16 - Bee: Never heard of a German sausage before
06/10/2019, 20:17 - Bee: I googled. It is larger than the ones I've eaten!
06/10/2019, 20:17 - Nischal Abraham: It's called a Brockwurst
06/10/2019, 20:18 - Nischal Abraham: Spelling may be incorrect
06/10/2019, 20:19 - Nischal Abraham: It's very meaty. I'd recommend only one for a meal
06/10/2019, 20:24 - Bee: So you finished dinner?
06/10/2019, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Just came back to my room
06/10/2019, 20:26 - Bee: Oh. I should go to sleep
06/10/2019, 20:27 - Bee: I miss you :(. It's worse on Sundays. Because even though we didn't talk much I got to see you once a week and I can't now
06/10/2019, 20:27 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. I'm praying for you
06/10/2019, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: We met quiet often those last 2 weeks
06/10/2019, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby... I miss you too. More than you know
06/10/2019, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: Always thankful for your prayers :). I don't think I'd get through half my day without it
06/10/2019, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's all. Now you may go sleep. Goodnight!?
06/10/2019, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's a typo... I don't know why I try to use my left hand at all... I meant !!
06/10/2019, 20:32 - Bee: I wish it was more
06/10/2019, 20:33 - Bee: Counting down to the day when I get to meet you. Even though I don't know when it is. Trusting God to carry us through.
06/10/2019, 20:33 - Bee: Always praying for you.
06/10/2019, 20:33 - Bee: Goodnight :)
06/10/2019, 20:34 - Bee: Why are you moving you thumb
06/10/2019, 20:34 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I'm not. I was using my first and middle finger
06/10/2019, 20:34 - Bee: Oh
06/10/2019, 20:35 - Bee: I'll go sleep now
06/10/2019, 20:35 - Bee: Bye.
06/10/2019, 20:35 - Nischal Abraham: ❤
06/10/2019, 20:36 - Nischal Abraham: Hope I'm Instagramming correctly
06/10/2019, 20:36 - Nischal Abraham: Byeeeeee
06/10/2019, 20:36 - Bee: :)
07/10/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! I hope you're having a great day!!
07/10/2019, 08:38 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :)
07/10/2019, 08:38 - Bee: Good day so far
07/10/2019, 08:38 - Bee: I hope you have a great day as well
07/10/2019, 08:38 - Bee: Packing lunch?
07/10/2019, 08:49 - Nischal Abraham: Not today. Maybe tomorrow
07/10/2019, 11:25 - Bee: Oh!
07/10/2019, 11:25 - Bee: I'm looking forward to the holiday tomorrow
07/10/2019, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice... I miss holidays midweek
07/10/2019, 13:04 - Bee: Yes. Makes the week bearable
07/10/2019, 13:04 - Bee: How's your day going so far?
07/10/2019, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: You deleted this message
07/10/2019, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Not too great
07/10/2019, 16:15 - Bee: Are you back home?
07/10/2019, 16:15 - Bee: Want to talk about it?
07/10/2019, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Just left college actually. Waiting for my bus. I do want to talk about it but after I get home
07/10/2019, 16:28 - Bee: Okay. Let me know. I'll be here
07/10/2019, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
07/10/2019, 17:00 - Bee: Hey
07/10/2019, 17:00 - Bee: Give me 15 minutes
07/10/2019, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yea no problem. Take your time... I just reached home too
07/10/2019, 17:15 - Bee: Hey
07/10/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hi :)
07/10/2019, 17:17 - Bee: Call?
07/10/2019, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: Done changing my sheets. I'm really happy right now 😊.
Please pray as I go for my immigration formalities tomorrow. Nothing that could go wrong but it's a new place and anything could go wrong
07/10/2019, 20:29 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and I finished the Etihad thing too... And another todo item of checking my phone recharge date
08/10/2019, 06:09 - Bee: Hey!!! This was such a good message to wake up to
08/10/2019, 06:09 - Bee: Well done, Nischal!!
08/10/2019, 06:11 - Bee: Praying. God is in control. You have to go to the police station right?
08/10/2019, 06:12 - Bee: I'm happy you're happy!
08/10/2019, 06:12 - Bee: You must have had a gooooooood sleep
08/10/2019, 06:12 - Bee: I'm leaving to go to Nidhi's now
08/10/2019, 06:12 - Bee: Going to meet the girls in the evening because they're busy now
08/10/2019, 08:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Good afternoon 😊. I had a lovely sleep. It was a bit too nice and I overslept a bit :P. But today's lecture starts late anyway so it's okay
08/10/2019, 08:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'll be going to the Garda station
08/10/2019, 08:21 - Nischal Abraham: Did Nidhi manage to finish? 😮. Thanks for helping her out
08/10/2019, 08:40 - Bee: No she hasn't finished. I'm here for moral support. :P I didn't do much yet but I think she has some work for me after lunch
08/10/2019, 08:41 - Bee: I hope you have a great day, Nischal. :)
08/10/2019, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you slept in and enjoy your holiday too 😊. It's a cold day today. It's been a constant 10° all morning
08/10/2019, 11:16 - Bee: I did! I woke up at 6 and forced myself to go to sleep. I woke up at 9:30 after that

08/10/2019, 13:42 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Looks cute! For a second I thought that's what Nidhi's making you do 😂
08/10/2019, 14:40 - Bee: 😂
08/10/2019, 14:40 - Bee: If only her projects were this fun
08/10/2019, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Well I won't be able to talk today. My appointment with the Garda is for 7:45
08/10/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Hey
08/10/2019, 17:21 - Bee: I'm still here
08/10/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Won't be able to talk either
08/10/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Praying for you and the process
08/10/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... Stayed for dinner? My lecture's done so now I'm just whiling away two hours
08/10/2019, 18:01 - Bee: Yes! There was Chinese
08/10/2019, 18:01 - Bee: On our way home now. Ben is here as well
08/10/2019, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Oh amazing! Really wish I was there
08/10/2019, 19:29 - Bee: To help with the project?
08/10/2019, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely to do this
08/10/2019, 19:44 - Bee: Hahaha
08/10/2019, 19:45 - Bee: I enjoy listening to Soph talk. She always has a lot to say and is so animated while talking
08/10/2019, 19:46 - Bee: I had a great day. Would love to hear about yours
08/10/2019, 19:46 - Bee: The next time we talk. Hopefully tomorrow
08/10/2019, 19:46 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
08/10/2019, 20:29 - Nischal Abraham: I had an interesting day too... I'm officially allowed to stay in Ireland till next year now
08/10/2019, 20:29 - Nischal Abraham: I hope we get to talk tomorrow!
08/10/2019, 22:01 - Nischal Abraham: Waiting for the bus for a loooong cause the gap is 1 hour in the evenings 😶
08/10/2019, 22:01 - Nischal Abraham: Time*
09/10/2019, 03:26 - Bee: 😌 praise God!

09/10/2019, 03:27 - Bee: I hope you have a productive day today :)
09/10/2019, 03:27 - Bee: I have community postings today.
09/10/2019, 07:30 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debs! I hope you have a great day yourself 😊. I'm hoping to attend the Christian Union meet today
09/10/2019, 09:03 - Nischal Abraham: I'm surprised how much of a difference 2° makes. It's at 8 now and my hands have frozen over 😅. Today my bandage comes off
09/10/2019, 11:12 - Bee: Finally!! Are you excited?
09/10/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Came to college at noon to work in research
09/10/2019, 11:14 - Bee: Do you use woollen gloves?
09/10/2019, 11:15 - Bee: On*
09/10/2019, 11:15 - Bee: Did you pack lunch?
09/10/2019, 11:15 - Bee: What time is the meet?
09/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: A bit scared. I just want it to have healed enough to not require another stitch :(
09/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: I have gloves. Not woollen cause rains. I couldn't wear them because of my dressing
09/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: No :(. I need to prep for it the day before it seems otherwise I don't get time. Or I need to get up earlier
09/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: 6-7 pm
09/10/2019, 15:03 - Bee: It's unlikely that they'll use stitches again...
09/10/2019, 15:03 - Bee: I'm on my way to Nidhi's
09/10/2019, 15:03 - Bee: It rained today
09/10/2019, 15:04 - Bee: It is very pleasant outside 😌
09/10/2019, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: It hasn't rained here... It's very pleasant inside :P. Lectures done now
09/10/2019, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just finishing up submissions for the next two hours

09/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
09/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: 😂
09/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Christian union?
09/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: I'm on my way home
09/10/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'm here... It'll start soon
09/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Oh
09/10/2019, 18:23 - Bee: My day was good. I like being occupied. Otherwise I just spend time staring at my phone
09/10/2019, 18:24 - Bee: It was okay. I have some work to do for tomorrow's submission so I'll do that now
09/10/2019, 20:50 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal ;)
09/10/2019, 20:51 - Bee: :)*
09/10/2019, 20:51 - Bee: Can't my eyes open anymore
09/10/2019, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
09/10/2019, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry I'm still here
09/10/2019, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so glad you had a good day! The Christian Union was an amazing time. I can't really explain it in detail over text but I met such wonderful people! Really enjoyed it
10/10/2019, 03:47 - Bee: Nooo don't be sorry
10/10/2019, 03:47 - Bee: Good morning!
10/10/2019, 03:48 - Bee: I'm glad you had a good day too!
10/10/2019, 03:49 - Bee: Thanking God for His provision of Christian Union :)
10/10/2019, 03:49 - Bee: Community postings today as well
10/10/2019, 03:52 - Bee: We're doing a street play on TB today
10/10/2019, 07:17 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! Have fun with the street play! I didn't know nurses did that 😋. Is it part of your course or an extra activity you can do?
10/10/2019, 08:14 - Bee: I didn't know nurses did that either. :P
10/10/2019, 08:15 - Bee: It was fun! And tiring. It is so sunny.
10/10/2019, 08:15 - Bee: It is a part of my course
10/10/2019, 08:15 - Bee: Good morning. :)
10/10/2019, 08:16 - Bee: Oh I said that already
10/10/2019, 08:17 - Bee: Any update on the project/thesis front?
10/10/2019, 08:18 - Bee: No project work today evening. Hopefully we can talk tonight
10/10/2019, 08:18 - Bee: My tonight
10/10/2019, 08:48 - Nischal Abraham: It's been cloudy today here. I just hope it doesn't rain while I'm traveling since I've started carrying my laptop with me
10/10/2019, 08:50 - Nischal Abraham: So I gave in my preferences as a list. Now they'll just assign an available project based on that. Maybe it's better this way. I wasn't too sure what project or field I was interested in anyway
10/10/2019, 08:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just have to do my best with whatever I get 😁
10/10/2019, 08:51 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so too! I have my rock climbing AGM today... Starts at your 10:30pm so I don't think I'll be free to talk anytime soon after that
10/10/2019, 08:52 - Nischal Abraham: But my lectures end early today! By 2pm Irish time... That's like 6:30 there
10/10/2019, 09:40 - Bee: I know you will.
10/10/2019, 09:41 - Bee: Sounds exciting!!
10/10/2019, 09:41 - Bee: Will you wait back in college?
10/10/2019, 10:06 - Bee: I'll be free :) until that Bible study
10/10/2019, 10:06 - Bee: The*
10/10/2019, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
10/10/2019, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: Lecture is done. So now I'm free for a long
10/10/2019, 13:58 - Bee: I haven't reached home yet :(
10/10/2019, 13:58 - Bee: I should reach in 10
10/10/2019, 14:15 - Bee: Hey
10/10/2019, 14:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hii!
10/10/2019, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't it almost time for the meeting?
10/10/2019, 14:16 - Bee: It is 6:45
10/10/2019, 14:16 - Bee: I'll leave at 7:15
10/10/2019, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Call?
10/10/2019, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Just general Maggi?
10/10/2019, 14:28 - Bee: Yes. Just general Maggi
10/10/2019, 14:28 - Bee: Easy and filling
10/10/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: I'm down to my last packet now :P
10/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Whaaa?! What will you do for the rest of your time there?!
10/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Also, go talk about anime!!
10/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Stop texting
10/10/2019, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: Make healthier food I hope 😁
10/10/2019, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: You don't want to text? :(
10/10/2019, 14:40 - Bee: Is that even a question
10/10/2019, 14:40 - Bee: I want to.
10/10/2019, 14:41 - Bee: But you're occupied and that's okay
10/10/2019, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I was bracing myself for a no 😂
10/10/2019, 14:41 - Bee: 😂
10/10/2019, 14:41 - Bee: What yaa
10/10/2019, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'll go back and join a conversation. Missing you!
10/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: I miss you too, Nischal. So much.
10/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: Please remember
10/10/2019, 14:44 - Bee: 🤗
10/10/2019, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: I know yaa. I was kidding before
10/10/2019, 15:01 - Bee: Oh 🤦🏻‍♀ sorry
10/10/2019, 15:01 - Bee: I reached the hospital
10/10/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: Had an interesting time here. Now I've got two hours to study before the Rock climbing AGM
10/10/2019, 16:48 - Bee: How is the study session going? Are you in the library?
10/10/2019, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: In a lab. It's going alright. Just an hour to go before the meet. How was Bible study?
10/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: It was good. Next Thursday will be the last for Jude
10/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: I was a little tired though. :(
10/10/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Oh Jude is still going on 😮. Feel asleep?
10/10/2019, 16:57 - Bee: No I didn't fall asleep :P
10/10/2019, 16:58 - Bee: I couldn't pay complete attention
10/10/2019, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: I know the feeling. This cold makes me feel the same way :P
10/10/2019, 17:10 - Bee: But you're indoors! :P
10/10/2019, 17:11 - Bee: How are you doing?
10/10/2019, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Indoors is warm and that makes me even more lethargic
10/10/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: Just spoke to Dad. Looks like family is doing well 😊. The weather has turned from nice and sunny to cloudy and rainy... Feels like it's 7 already 😂
10/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Oh you're allowed to talk
10/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: I forgot to ask you
10/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: How is your hand?
10/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Is it dressed?
10/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Will you be okay with the rock climbing?
10/10/2019, 17:25 - Bee: Also, can I call you for a minute or two? Just to say hi
10/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Sorry I kept my phone for charge and completely forgot. You still there?
10/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: My hands alright. There's no climbing today, just the meet... I'm praying it'll heal by the first climb cause I really want to go!
10/10/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'm not in the library so I just stepped outside for the call. I'm out now... If you want to talk I've still got 10 min
10/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Have fun, Nischal!! :)
10/10/2019, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Super short meeting is over :P
10/10/2019, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! It'll be good morning by the time you see this... Nothing at all happened today. They took our names for the group chat. But there's free pizza so dinner is sorted 😊
10/10/2019, 20:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
11/10/2019, 02:25 - Bee: Good morning!
11/10/2019, 02:26 - Bee: Alread!
11/10/2019, 02:26 - Bee: Already*
11/10/2019, 02:26 - Bee: Looks good! I mean not aesthetically. But it looked like it's healing well
11/10/2019, 02:27 - Bee: My last day of Urban community postings today
11/10/2019, 06:25 - Bee: Are you today's date?
11/10/2019, 06:26 - Bee: Cause you're an 11/10 :P
11/10/2019, 07:57 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
11/10/2019, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so glad you say that! I don't know what it's supposed to look like...
11/10/2019, 07:59 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. I'm really not
11/10/2019, 08:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'd be your date everyday if I could 😌
11/10/2019, 09:10 - Bee: Because today is October 11
11/10/2019, 09:11 - Bee: Did you get it?
11/10/2019, 09:11 - Bee: :P
11/10/2019, 09:11 - Bee: But then there'll be days when you'll be 1/11 also
11/10/2019, 09:12 - Bee: Now you know
11/10/2019, 09:12 - Bee: What's for breakfast?
11/10/2019, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: I got it
11/10/2019, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yes there will... But I'll still be me
11/10/2019, 10:02 - Bee: And you're 11/10
11/10/2019, 10:02 - Nischal Abraham: Still looks suspicious to me. Do you think I should cover it up and keep it leave it open? I'm home for the next two days so I can be careful about it
11/10/2019, 10:02 - Bee: You can keep it open
11/10/2019, 10:02 - Nischal Abraham: Oats and bacon
11/10/2019, 10:03 - Bee: There's no bleeding right?
11/10/2019, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. It's all clotted and dry
11/10/2019, 10:03 - Bee: Oh good
11/10/2019, 10:04 - Bee: You can leave it open
11/10/2019, 10:04 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you're talking about the wound and not the food 😅
11/10/2019, 10:04 - Bee: 😂
11/10/2019, 10:04 - Bee: You were talking about the wound?!
11/10/2019, 10:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
11/10/2019, 10:05 - Bee: Same
11/10/2019, 10:05 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
11/10/2019, 10:05 - Bee: Other than to study Cryptography
11/10/2019, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: Resolve my bank account in Ireland, call Joby about the heating problem, finally fix mudguards on the cycle and fill up the tyres
11/10/2019, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and most importantly find a recipe for dinner
11/10/2019, 10:15 - Bee: A recipe with rice?
11/10/2019, 10:15 - Bee: What movie was so sad that you'll never watch it again?
11/10/2019, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I haven't eaten a home meal in a while. Too much bread
11/10/2019, 10:38 - Nischal Abraham: I'll have to think about it... I definitely remember feeling that way but I don't remember which movie
11/10/2019, 11:06 - Bee: Oh
11/10/2019, 11:06 - Bee: Mine is Me before you
11/10/2019, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: Oh!! I thought of answering the same :P. I probably won't watch it again but not because it was too sad for me.
11/10/2019, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Though that movie did not have the regular happy ending and that did make me sad
11/10/2019, 11:23 - Bee: Why won't you watch it again?
11/10/2019, 11:23 - Bee: I was in this weird sad phase after watching it
11/10/2019, 11:23 - Bee: Never watching it again
11/10/2019, 11:26 - Nischal Abraham: It's one of those one time watch movies. There's nothing new to be added watching it again... Also I initially watched it just for Emilia Clarke(I hope that's her name)
11/10/2019, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: I think I've seen sadder and that's why this was alright. But a lot of my viewing experience was from TV shows as well, not just movies
11/10/2019, 11:38 - Bee: Oh like that
11/10/2019, 11:38 - Bee: That is her name
11/10/2019, 12:23 - Bee: This message was deleted
11/10/2019, 12:40 - Bee: Rolf's birthday today
11/10/2019, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I saw in the football group chat
11/10/2019, 13:11 - Bee: Okay
11/10/2019, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: But thanks for the reminder 😊. I would've left it as another undone item on my list otherwise
11/10/2019, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: Cycle fixing done too :). I think I used my left arm a bit too extensively on that one... It's starting to feel itchy
11/10/2019, 13:39 - Bee: No problem :)
11/10/2019, 13:39 - Bee: I think you'll be fine after some rest
11/10/2019, 13:43 - Nischal Abraham: Are you on your way back home?
11/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Yes
11/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Just crossed Majiwada
11/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... I should go have lunch
11/10/2019, 13:56 - Bee: Okay
11/10/2019, 13:56 - Bee: We could talk later if you're free...
11/10/2019, 13:56 - Bee: Whenever you are
11/10/2019, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love that. I'll message you as soon as I'm done eating
11/10/2019, 13:59 - Bee: Okay. :)
11/10/2019, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free from now on... Let me know when you are
11/10/2019, 16:02 - Bee: Hey
11/10/2019, 16:02 - Bee: I was taking a bath
11/10/2019, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
11/10/2019, 16:04 - Bee: It was alright
11/10/2019, 16:04 - Bee: Call?
11/10/2019, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: If you're free
11/10/2019, 18:15 - Bee: The fish fry was yum 😋
11/10/2019, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Ohh!! It was fish fry!
11/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Yes!!
11/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: And dal and rice
11/10/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: I figured out why I'm so hesitant to go out
11/10/2019, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: It's cause I have to change 😞
11/10/2019, 18:20 - Bee: Into thermals?
11/10/2019, 18:20 - Bee: Or because it's too cold?
11/10/2019, 18:21 - Bee: Heading out now?
11/10/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yes
11/10/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: To all of them 😂
11/10/2019, 18:27 - Bee: 😂
11/10/2019, 18:28 - Bee: I should go to sleep
11/10/2019, 18:28 - Bee: I have to wake up at 5. I'm not looking forward to the waking up part. Looking forward to NICU though

12/10/2019, 12:13 - Bee: How's your day going?
12/10/2019, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Eh it's been alright. Not so fulfilling cause I'm not doing anything productive 🙁
12/10/2019, 13:33 - Bee: What do you want to finish today?
12/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Well I was supposed to study in the morning... But I didn't. I'm making stuff for lunch at least. Hoping to make some soup for dinner

12/10/2019, 14:13 - Bee: You can still study. So many hours more
12/10/2019, 14:13 - Bee: :)
12/10/2019, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: I know... It's just when the day starts bad it tends to continue that way
12/10/2019, 15:15 - Bee: Oh I'm not alone then
But then I tell myself that I don't have to wait for a new day to make a change. And then I read motivating quotes in Pinterest :P

13/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Photos don't really do it justice
13/10/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Agreed
13/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: You need to feel the cold bite you to really enjoy it

13/10/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: It really is. I wish you could see what I see
13/10/2019, 17:45 - Bee: You could save a red/Orange leaf as a memento
13/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Wouldn't it crumble over time?
13/10/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Not if you keep it in a book
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: I can't store the way the sky looks in a book

13/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: How's your wound?
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: It's alright. I still think it's a bit misaligned but it's clotted now so I'm trusting my body to take care of the rest
13/10/2019, 18:01 - Bee: Oh. Staring at it too much?
13/10/2019, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: I probably am 😂
13/10/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Nischal noooooo

14/10/2019, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it's cause I don't really understand the project specifications myself
14/10/2019, 13:34 - Bee: Oh. You've heard too many things about the professor!
14/10/2019, 13:34 - Bee: Praying for you and for him and the meet

14/10/2019, 13:39 - Bee: Sorry I'm confused
14/10/2019, 13:40 - Bee: OH. Got it.

14/10/2019, 13:43 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe you have a headache cause you haven't slept enough 🙁
14/10/2019, 13:43 - Bee: Maybe
14/10/2019, 13:44 - Bee: I don't know if I should take a nap now
14/10/2019, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: I was planning on cycling today but it was raining in the morning so I decided against it. I'm glad I did cause I need to buy stuff as well
14/10/2019, 13:44 - Bee: Or go to sleep early
14/10/2019, 13:44 - Bee: Groceries?
14/10/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: It'd be better to just sleep properly later
14/10/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Instead of broken sleep
14/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Yes
14/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: I'll go to sleep early
14/10/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Now that I have a lunch meal to plan I want to change things up instead of the same filling in my sandwich
14/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Not sure if we'll get to talk then
14/10/2019, 13:46 - Bee: Oh!! Sounds exciting. I like planning. Sometime ms
14/10/2019, 13:46 - Bee: Sometimes*
14/10/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. Your health is more important 😊
14/10/2019, 13:46 - Bee: Oh Nischallllll
14/10/2019, 13:46 - Bee: Tomorrow then.
14/10/2019, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: We don't need to talk everyday Debby. There's going to be more and more of these days where it'll be difficult to talk
14/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: That is true
14/10/2019, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Especially since our conversations are always an hour long 😂
14/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: I don't like it that it's true though
14/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: One hour is less!! :P
14/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: The longer it is the less likely for it to happen. But it's okay. We'll definitely find time eventually
14/10/2019, 13:48 - Bee: Eventually. Yes. :)
14/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Struggles of long distance relationships :(
14/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: We have to prove you wrong okay
14/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: It's okay God will take care of that
14/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: He already knows
14/10/2019, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: Prove me wrong about what?
14/10/2019, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: Amen to that. It's my biggest assurance everyday :)
14/10/2019, 13:51 - Bee: You once said that you always believed long distance doesn't work
14/10/2019, 13:51 - Bee: Mine too ☺
14/10/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yea... Its what the movies and TV shows have made me believe. Though nothing between us has been like the movies so....
14/10/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Except for that silence when the phone call comes to an end :P
14/10/2019, 13:54 - Bee: Time for lab/meet?
14/10/2019, 13:54 - Bee: Praying. Bye! :)
14/10/2019, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: Bye. Thanks Deb :)
14/10/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Off to bed. Goodnight!
14/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Sleep well. Hope you had a nice walk
14/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: I did
14/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: How did the meet with your professor go?
14/10/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: It went well. I'm a bit overwhelmed by how much work I'm gonna have to put in. But I'm really glad God helped me get assigned to this project
14/10/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: It's actually something I like to do 😁
14/10/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'm waiting for my bus now. Took a while to finish with lab since I joined in late
14/10/2019, 17:56 - Bee: That's a relief!! I'm glad you got something you like
14/10/2019, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. Well goodnight Debby! I hope you feel better tomorrow :)
14/10/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
14/10/2019, 17:58 - Bee: I hope the rest of your day goes well
14/10/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be counting after the half an hour wait for my bus :,P
14/10/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: :P *
14/10/2019, 18:00 - Bee: 😂
14/10/2019, 18:00 - Bee: Fair enough
14/10/2019, 18:02 - Bee: I miss you. Goodnight.
14/10/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Missing you too Debby. Goodnight for the third time :)
15/10/2019, 03:19 - Bee: Good morning!!
15/10/2019, 03:20 - Bee: I had the luxury of sleeping for 7 hours :O
15/10/2019, 09:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh that's awesome! I overslept till 7am and got late for my bus 😅
15/10/2019, 09:34 - Bee: Oh no! I hope you weren't late for classes
15/10/2019, 09:44 - Nischal Abraham: I sure am. I'm still waiting for my bus. One missed bus ends up being a half hour wait
15/10/2019, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't miss much so it's all good 😌. How's your day going? Community posting today?
15/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: I had college today. My community postings in the slums are over. Postings in the village will be sometime in December
15/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: Postings at the hospital begin tomorrow
15/10/2019, 13:06 - Bee: My day was alright. Was working on research the whole day... Just left from college
15/10/2019, 13:06 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
15/10/2019, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! My day's been alright. Other than being late for the lecture nothing new has happened. It's lunch break for another hour now... I'm feeling really tired for some reason 😅
15/10/2019, 13:10 - Bee: Oh! What's for lunch?
15/10/2019, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Sandwich. I should start packing two or more... One isn't enough for lunch
15/10/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: I need to buy a bigger box to carry my lunch too :P. I'm using kitchen containers at the moment cause that's all I have
15/10/2019, 13:41 - Bee: One sandwich isn't much. Mayo salami?
15/10/2019, 13:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And mashed eggs
15/10/2019, 13:43 - Bee: Ahh. Sounds good. Now I'll be thinking of sandwiches until I reach home :P
15/10/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... I'm sure you'll be eating something much better than sandwiches :P
15/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: I don't know if it's better... I'll be eating Wai Wai. Have you eaten those? Instant noodles from the north east
15/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: Papa brought more than a dozen from siliguri
15/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't heard of them. But I've come to realise a lot of these instant noodles are the same and only the tastemaker tends to be different
15/10/2019, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Are they good?
15/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: Nooo these are different!! You can them raw. They have masala on the raw cakes as well. They are good!! And they have two masalas inside. And onion oil. It is good!
15/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: Eat them raw*
15/10/2019, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh now I'll be thinking of noodles all through my lab 🤤
15/10/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: I tried an instant noodle packet here but it was horrible 😂. Maybe the company I bought was bad
15/10/2019, 13:53 - Bee: You must try Wai wai. There's no guarantee that they'll last until you come though
15/10/2019, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'll have to head to Siliguri first then
15/10/2019, 13:54 - Bee: Make a 'Things to do when I go to India' list :P
15/10/2019, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Well... Unlike Ireland it's a lot more difficult to go to different places around India easily
15/10/2019, 13:59 - Bee: Yes. That's why a bucket list. Mine is full of unrealistic items
15/10/2019, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... I guess that is the point of a bucket list
15/10/2019, 14:00 - Bee: 🤷🏻‍♀
15/10/2019, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just add on to the list of things I was supposed to before I left
15/10/2019, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Okay my lab is starting. Talk later! Enjoy prayer meeting if you're going 😊
15/10/2019, 14:04 - Bee: Lab?
15/10/2019, 14:05 - Bee: Bye! :)
15/10/2019, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Lecs done for the day! So much studying to do this week 😶
15/10/2019, 17:15 - Bee: It begins!!
15/10/2019, 17:16 - Bee: The studying. Proper studying
15/10/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. Kind of excited for it
15/10/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Only kind of. I'm hoping to get up early tomorrow. Will really have to push myself off the bed
15/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Hey. I had to mail the research stuff to my guide by 11. So I was busy doing that. So frustrated because it's a group project and everyone doesn't do what they're supposed to 😔
15/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Couldn't go for the prayer meeting
15/10/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... Don't let me disturb you then
15/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Having dinner now
15/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: No I'm done
15/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: I just sent it
15/10/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool. Did you manage to finish it?
15/10/2019, 18:37 - Bee: Yes!!
15/10/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😊. Enjoy your dinner. I'm thinking up what to eat for dinner myself
15/10/2019, 18:44 - Bee: Did you make soup yet?
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Bee: Khichdi?
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Bee: That chicken dish with mushrooms?
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Bee: Oh wait you don't have dal
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Not my own. There is still soup in the packet
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'm trying to move away from that :P
15/10/2019, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Probably use up my beans today
15/10/2019, 18:46 - Bee: Oh!! Beans and rice? 🤔
15/10/2019, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
15/10/2019, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a plan
15/10/2019, 18:51 - Bee: Beans as in rajma?
15/10/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no... The green stalk ones
15/10/2019, 18:51 - Bee: OH
15/10/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm using that and potato and chili powder and frying I guess
15/10/2019, 19:02 - Bee: Sounds good. You're getting better at this cooking thing
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Na... It only sounds good :P. You're still awake? Got more assignments to do?
15/10/2019, 19:03 - Bee: No. Done for today. Getting ready for bed
15/10/2019, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. But no 7 hours of sleep today
15/10/2019, 19:04 - Bee: Nope. Hardly 5 hours. I don't mind. I'm well rested because I'd yesterday's sleep
15/10/2019, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: If only my sleep worked the same way 😂
15/10/2019, 19:06 - Bee: 😂
15/10/2019, 19:06 - Bee: I'm go sleep now
15/10/2019, 19:07 - Bee: I'll*
15/10/2019, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Goodnight Debby! Enjoy sleep 😌
15/10/2019, 19:08 - Bee: Goodnight! :) Enjoy your dinner. And sleep
15/10/2019, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: I will. Regardless of how bad it tastes 😁
15/10/2019, 19:09 - Bee: ☺  that's good.
16/10/2019, 02:43 - Bee: Hey you :)
16/10/2019, 02:43 - Bee: Good morning!
16/10/2019, 02:43 - Bee: I hope you have a great day today
16/10/2019, 02:44 - Bee: I'm posted in the ward. So there's a lot of holding and swaddling newborns in my schedule today 😌
16/10/2019, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Sounds like you're headed for a good day!! 😁
16/10/2019, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I hope you find joy through your day too ☺. I've got my Christian Union meetup today so excited to meet everyone again
16/10/2019, 13:20 - Bee: HI!!! Sorry I couldn't reply. Had to come to college after lunch for research stuff. Just left from college. There's college tomorrow as well
16/10/2019, 13:20 - Bee: How has your day been?
16/10/2019, 13:21 - Bee: I swaddled so many babies!! So adorable all of them. They look like little dolls. And they smell so good. I'm not weird I promise
16/10/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take your word for it. J
Sitting in the cafeteria for lunch
16/10/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'm*
16/10/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Found a nice group to chat with... But it's all in Hindi 😂
16/10/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Did I read that sentence right
16/10/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Hindi?! 😂
16/10/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Packed lunch?
16/10/2019, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'm full and satisfied 😌
16/10/2019, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: Table of Indians and Pakistanis
16/10/2019, 13:39 - Bee: Oh! Anyone from your course?
16/10/2019, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep all of them
16/10/2019, 14:06 - Bee: Oh wow
16/10/2019, 14:06 - Bee: Lab now?
16/10/2019, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Just starting
16/10/2019, 14:06 - Bee: I have another research submission tonight. But I really want to visit Patti with Reenee. I don't know what to do
16/10/2019, 14:06 - Bee: I'll try to finish as soon as I can
16/10/2019, 14:07 - Bee: Okay! Talk later
16/10/2019, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Try to finish it as soon as you can. But if you're not planning on going for too long then I think it would be nice to visit Patti
16/10/2019, 14:11 - Bee: Yes. I hope I don't feel too tired once I reach home
16/10/2019, 14:11 - Bee: This message was deleted
16/10/2019, 16:10 - Bee: Patti wasn't home 😂
16/10/2019, 16:11 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/10/2019, 16:11 - Bee: It was a very quick visit.
16/10/2019, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... She must've been called elsewhere for a birthday party 😊
16/10/2019, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: Well I guess this means you have more time for your assignment now
16/10/2019, 17:06 - Bee: Yes she was at Shiphrah akka's
16/10/2019, 17:06 - Bee: Yes! Came back in 20 minutes. Parents were shocked
16/10/2019, 17:07 - Bee: What's up?
16/10/2019, 17:07 - Bee: Back home?
16/10/2019, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Na... Got the CU today. So I'm just hanging out in the lab
16/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: Ahh. What's the topic for today
16/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: ?
16/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: Also, when will you be back home?
16/10/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: Topic is belonging. I'll probably be late for home if the trend of last week continues
16/10/2019, 17:27 - Bee: Oh! Have fun! You'll get to meet Paddy!! Isn't that how his name is spelt?
16/10/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Paddy might be there. And yes that is how it's spelt :P
16/10/2019, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: How's your assignment going?
16/10/2019, 17:56 - Bee: Almost done. 😌
16/10/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: I should be heading to the meet as well. All the best!
16/10/2019, 18:02 - Bee: :)
16/10/2019, 18:03 - Bee: Let me know when you reach home. We can talk if I'm up...
16/10/2019, 18:03 - Bee: Have fun :)
16/10/2019, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing!
16/10/2019, 19:43 - Bee: I'm off to bed. I hope you had a nice time at the CU meet. Can't wait to hear about it. :)
Goodnight!
16/10/2019, 21:37 - Nischal Abraham: I had a wonderful time at the CU. Oh I have so much to tell you!! I'm sorry we couldn't talk today :(
16/10/2019, 21:38 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have a good nights sleep!! And a wonderful day in the morning too 😊
17/10/2019, 06:19 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :) I did sleep well
17/10/2019, 06:20 - Bee: My day has been okay so far. I was in the hospital and now I'm going to college. My research guide is going on holiday and wants to give us some more corrections. I hope this will be the last of it
17/10/2019, 06:21 - Bee: We'll talk soon hopefully
17/10/2019, 06:21 - Bee: Have a productive day! :)
17/10/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: I need to meet with the professor for my project as well today 😅. I haven't done any of the things he assigned me to do. I'll have to squeeze those into the few hours before I have to meet him
17/10/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! You too 😊
17/10/2019, 09:10 - Bee: But whhyyy?!
17/10/2019, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: You don't want to have a productive day?
17/10/2019, 09:17 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/10/2019, 09:21 - Bee: The wound looks good!!!!
17/10/2019, 09:22 - Bee: Why didn't you do the things he assigned you to do
17/10/2019, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well I got it on Monday. And then I was either busy or lazy
17/10/2019, 10:25 - Bee: Oh
17/10/2019, 10:25 - Bee: I hope you find time to finish it
17/10/2019, 10:26 - Bee: Are you able to move your thumb without difficulty?
17/10/2019, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: My hand can move perfectly fine. It's interesting though. I think the skin over the cut is thin so it turns purple in the cold and red when it's warm
17/10/2019, 12:46 - Bee: That is interesting! How has your day been so far? Did you get time to work on your project thing?
17/10/2019, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: I have time now. My lecture is done for the day
17/10/2019, 14:10 - Bee: No lab?
17/10/2019, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Today's lecture is a lab+lecture session. Thursdays are nice days that end by 2 😌
17/10/2019, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: Well now with weekly meetup for project it'll end at 4 😂
17/10/2019, 14:12 - Bee: Oh yes you mentioned it once
17/10/2019, 14:12 - Bee: Sounds very exciting 😛
17/10/2019, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: Sure... I guess exciting is one word for it. Well it's good I'm meeting up with him cause I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to be doing yet anyway
17/10/2019, 14:13 - Bee: You're working on it the whole year right? Or just this semester
17/10/2019, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: The whole year. Just starting out now so it's more or research at this point
17/10/2019, 14:17 - Bee: What was the topic? (I can't remember)
17/10/2019, 14:17 - Bee: Also, lunch?
17/10/2019, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: Even I can't remember 😂. Jk it's retrieving a person's search history in detail
17/10/2019, 14:18 - Nischal Abraham: More sandwiches. Today's filling was hummus, butter and cheese
17/10/2019, 14:24 - Bee: Nischal that's sounds good! Are you full? Or still hungry?
17/10/2019, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'm plenty full. 2 sandwiches make a good lunch 😁
17/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: Also, I'm free after 9 today... Let me know if we can talk
17/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: I haven't reached home yet and I have a research thing to do so I don't think I can go for the meeting
17/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: But you have a test tomorrow
17/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: We can talk tomorrow then
17/10/2019, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I should be free by then too. Message me when you're free and I'll tell decide then

17/10/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: I do say so... And it feels like forever since we've talked
17/10/2019, 14:31 - Bee: 3 days... Almost forever
17/10/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. It still feels like forever
17/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: 5 days will be forever
17/10/2019, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: It won't be 5 days... I have a good feeling about tonight
17/10/2019, 14:35 - Bee: :)
17/10/2019, 14:35 - Bee: I hope so
17/10/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Also cause if not today I'm not sure about tomorrow cause I'll be going rock climbing
17/10/2019, 14:44 - Bee: Oh
17/10/2019, 14:44 - Bee: I'll be helping Nidhi with her model tomorrow
17/10/2019, 14:47 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice!! She has her submission on Saturday right? I was just thinking of messaging her today
17/10/2019, 14:50 - Bee: Yes Saturday

17/10/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: We can always talk another time :)
17/10/2019, 17:50 - Bee: No we're talking tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
17/10/2019, 17:50 - Bee: I'll be done in an hour
17/10/2019, 17:50 - Bee: We can always keep pushing it Nischal :(
17/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Okay okay 😂. I'll be here. Just message me when you're free
17/10/2019, 17:50 - Bee: And then really it will be forever
17/10/2019, 18:51 - Bee: I overestimated myself
I need 30 minutes more and then I'll be free.
17/10/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: .
17/10/2019, 18:52 - Bee: :)
17/10/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just using this time to study so the only negative here is that you'll be sleeping less
17/10/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Please don't worry about that. I'll be fine
17/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: Hey. I'm free whenever you are

17/10/2019, 21:30 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
17/10/2019, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Missing you so much
18/10/2019, 02:34 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 02:37 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
18/10/2019, 02:38 - Bee: Praying for you as you prepare to write your test.
18/10/2019, 07:33 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
18/10/2019, 07:33 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for praying Debby! I really need it, but really don't deserve it
18/10/2019, 07:34 - Nischal Abraham: I managed to get some more time this morning to study though. Woke up at 5:30. Which makes me believe I can get up early if I have reason enough to despite the cold
18/10/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: Or maybe the heater helped it be not so cold and I could get up. Either way I thank God for mercies 😊
18/10/2019, 09:17 - Bee: 5:30 is good!!! Proud of you!
18/10/2019, 09:18 - Bee: What time will your exam be?
18/10/2019, 09:18 - Bee: Continuing to pray
18/10/2019, 09:18 - Bee: Are you nervous/anxious?
18/10/2019, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: Test is in another hour. I am very nervous 😅. But a bit more confident with every new thing I can cover. And today's lecture was good. He's very helpful as a lecturer so good vibes 😁
18/10/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Oh!!
18/10/2019, 13:26 - Bee: That's good! You have prepared. You'll do fine! Praying.
18/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Let me know how it went.
18/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Also, rock climbing!!!!!!
18/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Have fun!
18/10/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Test went well. On my way to rock climbing now
18/10/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Praise God!!
18/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: I went to Nidhi's for the model... I couldn't do much though. Joji uncle and Julie aunty came over and they insisted on dropping my back home
18/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Me*
18/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: But I get to sleep early!
18/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: So I'll do that
18/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Goodnight, dearest Nischal.
18/10/2019, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I had loads of fun. I'll tell you all about it soon 😊

19/10/2019, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's a lovely song
19/10/2019, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby. Hope your day has been blessed so far! I really praise God for yesterday. The more I think about it the more clear it becomes that it wasn't me but God's grace
19/10/2019, 12:28 - Bee: Hey :)
19/10/2019, 12:29 - Bee: My day went well :) I'm excited for tomorrow. And Monday.
19/10/2019, 12:31 - Bee: Are you talking about the test in particular? Or your day in general? Either way God is good!
19/10/2019, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear! 😊. What's on Monday?
19/10/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: Both
19/10/2019, 12:36 - Bee: Rajya Sabha elections. So a holiday for me
19/10/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice. Holiday 😁
19/10/2019, 12:39 - Bee: Yes 😌
19/10/2019, 12:39 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
19/10/2019, 12:39 - Bee: For the second half of your day
19/10/2019, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Got some shopping, some studying, some cooking
19/10/2019, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Usual Saturday... Put the clothes out to dry as well
19/10/2019, 13:06 - Bee: Oh
19/10/2019, 13:06 - Bee: How are you?
19/10/2019, 13:11 - Bee: Random thought. You mean a lot to me. End of random thought.
19/10/2019, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: My body aches all over... But I'm really happy :)
19/10/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Doesn't seem random to me... Sounds like a very thought out thought. And I love it 😊
19/10/2019, 13:29 - Bee: I'm totally fine. Just that my heart is suddenly working faster. That's all.
19/10/2019, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Something scary happen at college?
19/10/2019, 13:48 - Bee: What noooooooooooo
19/10/2019, 13:48 - Bee: 😂
19/10/2019, 13:48 - Bee: .
19/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that! Aww... you're being silly
19/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Reached home yet?
19/10/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Nope. I'm waiting in Thane station for Jason
19/10/2019, 13:54 - Bee: Priya wants to surprise him and asked me if I could get him to come here
19/10/2019, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds exciting! Have fun Debs 😁. I just got done with lunch
19/10/2019, 14:32 - Bee: Yes. I'll have fun third wheeling
19/10/2019, 14:32 - Bee: What was for lunch?
19/10/2019, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Rice and fried vegetables
19/10/2019, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: Third wheeling can be fun if you're good friends 😊
19/10/2019, 14:40 - Bee: True. And these two try very hard to include me. It's always Priya and I talking and Jason sitting there looking bored
19/10/2019, 14:45 - Nischal Abraham: I can imagine 😂. Maybe for Jason's sake you should third wheel less often then. Today not included
19/10/2019, 15:06 - Bee: 😂
19/10/2019, 15:07 - Bee: I'm fifth wheeling 😶
19/10/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: What!? 😂. You've gone to the next level!!
19/10/2019, 15:08 - Bee: 😂
19/10/2019, 15:09 - Bee: I'm here for the momos
19/10/2019, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Momos sound like the right answer :P
19/10/2019, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your momos then! I'll be calling home. It's been a week since I've spoken to them
19/10/2019, 15:12 - Bee: Okay. :)
19/10/2019, 15:12 - Bee: Call me also once in a while :P
19/10/2019, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'll try
19/10/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Hey
19/10/2019, 18:16 - Bee: You must be occupied
19/10/2019, 18:16 - Bee: I hope you got to finish your to-do list for today
19/10/2019, 18:16 - Bee: I'm not feeling very well. The tiredness from the week is catching up.
19/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: So off to bed
19/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
19/10/2019, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy... I'm sorry I'm out buying stuff I need for the week
19/10/2019, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: I hope it's nothing major. Rest well
19/10/2019, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I have a feeling we'll get time to talk tomorrow :)
20/10/2019, 07:24 - Bee: Nothing major
20/10/2019, 07:25 - Bee: Good morning! :)
20/10/2019, 07:25 - Bee: I hope you have a spirit-led worship.
20/10/2019, 07:25 - Bee: I'm learning how to cook pork today.
20/10/2019, 07:25 - Bee: Do you eat pork?
20/10/2019, 07:25 - Bee: Ttyl!
20/10/2019, 07:39 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear it 😌
20/10/2019, 07:39 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
20/10/2019, 07:39 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you did too :)
20/10/2019, 07:40 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh cool! I wonder how different that is from beef
20/10/2019, 07:41 - Nischal Abraham: I have. Don't know how to cook it. Also bacon is a form of pork if I'm not mistaken
20/10/2019, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to 😊. I hope the rest of your day goes well too! Praying for the Sunday school and the gospel meeting and whatever fun activity you have lined up after that since Nidhi's submissions are done now 😂
20/10/2019, 08:14 - Bee: Yes! So you eat pork
20/10/2019, 08:15 - Bee: Thank you. :)
I think I'll have a quiet night tonight instead
20/10/2019, 14:20 - Nischal Abraham: I had a wonderful lunch! Potluck at the assembly with spare food to take home 😁
20/10/2019, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorted for the next 2 days
20/10/2019, 15:17 - Bee: Homemade food!!! 😋
20/10/2019, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Homemade lasagna and storebought pizza but close enough 😂
20/10/2019, 16:14 - Bee: 😂 no cooking for two days!
20/10/2019, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yess!!
20/10/2019, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: And today is a nice sunny day
20/10/2019, 16:43 - Bee: Not too cold?
20/10/2019, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: It's pretty cold outside. But we've got the room heater working now so indoors is just nice 😌
20/10/2019, 16:52 - Bee: That's nice 😊
20/10/2019, 16:52 - Bee: What's up?
20/10/2019, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Lazing around after a heavy Sunday lunch 😅
20/10/2019, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: I was sleeping on the bus ride. Buses are so comfortable sometimes
20/10/2019, 17:04 - Bee: I wish I could say that about the buses here
20/10/2019, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Well my hiranandani bus was good enough to sleep in
20/10/2019, 17:08 - Bee: Oh. Pawar Nagar buses aren't
20/10/2019, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: But at least they don't take an hour of travel right?
20/10/2019, 17:08 - Bee: Nope
20/10/2019, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Or cost 240 rupees one way 😂
20/10/2019, 17:11 - Bee: Whooaa one way!?! Must've been an AC bus
20/10/2019, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: They all are. They've got heaters and WiFi
20/10/2019, 17:13 - Bee: 😂
20/10/2019, 17:13 - Bee: No wonder
20/10/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well still. I don't really have the cheaper non AC option 🤣
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: Nooo there are
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Bee: Sometimes when I go to Joyce's straight from college I take a bus which charges 15 rupees upto Patlipada
20/10/2019, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: NO! A whole 15 rupees 😱. How could they charge you so much
20/10/2019, 17:22 - Bee: 😂
20/10/2019, 17:23 - Bee: What yaaaaaaa
20/10/2019, 17:23 - Bee: It was a low kinda day for me
20/10/2019, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Why what happened?
20/10/2019, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Or do you mean low as in chill
20/10/2019, 17:26 - Bee: I had a rough week...I was unprepared for worship today :(
20/10/2019, 17:26 - Bee: Didn't have much to offer
20/10/2019, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. How're you doing now? Want to talk about it?
20/10/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Yes
20/10/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Whenever
20/10/2019, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free whenever. You tell me
20/10/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Okay. Almost dinner with dinner. In a few minutes?
20/10/2019, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time :). Let me know when you're free
20/10/2019, 17:37 - Bee: I will. :)

20/10/2019, 22:13 - Bee: I miss you too, 'ma sweety' :P 😂
20/10/2019, 22:14 - Bee: Sorry this thing isn't for me either
20/10/2019, 22:14 - Bee: Bye!
20/10/2019, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂

21/10/2019, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: For Halloween?
21/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: No no
21/10/2019, 14:44 - Bee: Simply
21/10/2019, 14:44 - Bee: They are those LED strip lights which we can stick on walls
21/10/2019, 14:44 - Bee: It has a remote control and we can choose the colors!!
21/10/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: WOAH! Did you take pics?
21/10/2019, 16:30 - Bee: No
21/10/2019, 16:30 - Bee: I can ask Reenee for photos though
21/10/2019, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's alright. The way you described it sounded pretty ☺
21/10/2019, 16:32 - Bee: It is!! We switched off the lights and were looking at those for a while. Felt nice
21/10/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a fun time. So how was your day?
21/10/2019, 16:54 - Bee: It was a good day! I slept in. By slept in I mean I slept until 9. I tried to force myself to sleep longer but I was fully awake... Had breakfast with maa and the brothers. And then voted!! Then there was lunch with Nidhi, Arpitha, Reenee, Lakshmi, Holly, and Benna. After that Reenee and I went around looking for those LED lights and we found them in Lok puram... Then we walked to Happy Valley. Talked about anything and everything on our way
21/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: We put those up and just sat for a while... Then video called Ruth
21/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: And now I'm home
21/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: That's a long message
21/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: Sorry!
21/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: How was your day?
21/10/2019, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: I love long messages 😊
21/10/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know in half an hour how my day was. I'll be free then. Is that fine?
21/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: Yes yes
21/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: No hurry
21/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: I'll be here

21/10/2019, 17:34 - Bee: Just finished dinner
21/10/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: You end up having dinner pretty late don't you
21/10/2019, 17:41 - Bee: Yes... Most of the days. Because I usually eat a snack after college
21/10/2019, 17:41 - Bee: And then I'm not hungry for a while
21/10/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Wasn't feeling too great in the morning. I'm hopeful now. I was home today and got things done
21/10/2019, 17:41 - Bee: Oh no! No college?
21/10/2019, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: There was. I didn't go
21/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: Oh
21/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: Do you want to talk about it?
21/10/2019, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Can you talk?
21/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: Yes
21/10/2019, 20:07 - Bee: Continuing to pray for you.
21/10/2019, 20:07 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
21/10/2019, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: You're still awake!?
21/10/2019, 20:07 - Bee: 😶
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Yes
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you'd be asleep long ago :P
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Tomorrow I'll tell you why
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Bee: I thought so too!
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Goodnight :)
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Bee: :)
21/10/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debs. Really appreciate it
21/10/2019, 20:09 - Bee: Always praying. That's all I can do from 7966 kilometers away
21/10/2019, 20:09 - Bee: Yes, I googled
21/10/2019, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: 😂
21/10/2019, 20:10 - Bee: :P
21/10/2019, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: I'll remember that
21/10/2019, 20:10 - Bee: The distance?
21/10/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: That and the fact that you took the time to look it up :)
21/10/2019, 20:11 - Bee: 🤗
22/10/2019, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I hope you're having a good day!! Mine is already better than yesterday 😁
22/10/2019, 09:16 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :) I'm glad to hear that!!
22/10/2019, 09:16 - Bee: My day has been alright so far... I'm at home today. I didn't go
22/10/2019, 09:17 - Bee: Everything is okay if you're wondering
22/10/2019, 09:17 - Bee: Just stayed home
22/10/2019, 09:18 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear. I was wondering 😂. Enjoy your day at home then. I managed to cycle here today (finally)
22/10/2019, 09:19 - Bee: Whoa! Wasn't it too cold?
22/10/2019, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: It may have been but now I'm sweating
22/10/2019, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: I was covered when I started. Gloves, hat, sweater
22/10/2019, 09:28 - Bee: Oh!
22/10/2019, 09:28 - Bee: Proud of you, Nischal!! 🥳
22/10/2019, 09:28 - Bee: :P
22/10/2019, 14:57 - Bee: Hey you
22/10/2019, 14:57 - Bee: Hope you're having a good day so far
22/10/2019, 14:57 - Bee: ☺
22/10/2019, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: Boring lecture day today 😅
22/10/2019, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: So turns out I haven't attended a single day of games society meets which happens in Tuesdays
22/10/2019, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably wait back for that today
22/10/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: But it honestly isn't a bad day. Just bored out of my mind in this lecture. Everything is happening in slow motion. I would've left early if there was anywhere I needed to be
22/10/2019, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: How has your day been?
22/10/2019, 16:41 - Bee: So have you stayed back?
22/10/2019, 16:42 - Bee: My day went well 😊
22/10/2019, 16:42 - Bee: Jason and I cooked lunch today
22/10/2019, 16:42 - Bee: Guess what I made
22/10/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Got my cycle lights today so no problem cycling back at night
22/10/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Pork?
22/10/2019, 17:38 - Bee: No 😶
22/10/2019, 17:38 - Bee: Dal.
22/10/2019, 17:39 - Bee: I hope my answer changes one day
22/10/2019, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you're an expert at that now 😂. How long did you take?
22/10/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Hardly 20 minutes!! That's good compared to the 1.5 hours I took the first time
22/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! What did Jason make?
22/10/2019, 17:41 - Bee: Jason made ridge gourd with beans
22/10/2019, 17:41 - Bee: And we fried fish
22/10/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lovely lunch. Speaking of I just remembered I need to go buy stuff from Aldi
22/10/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'll go do that now. Will you be going tomorrow?
22/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: Yes yes
22/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: Going tomorrow
22/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: Four more days until two weeks of holiday
22/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: 🤩
22/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Wooo!! 4 more days until 1 week of holiday 😂
22/10/2019, 18:05 - Bee: You mean study week :P
22/10/2019, 18:05 - Bee: What about games society meet?
22/10/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it's at 6:30. Done with my shopping
22/10/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh man showing up 2 weeks late just means I know nobody 😂
22/10/2019, 18:36 - Bee: You'll make friends
22/10/2019, 18:36 - Bee: Many more weeks to go
22/10/2019, 19:04 - Bee: Beloved
22/10/2019, 19:06 - Bee: Hope you're having fun and making new memories
22/10/2019, 19:06 - Bee: Goodnight :)

22/10/2019, 20:53 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee :). I hope you have a great day tomorrow
23/10/2019, 07:07 - Bee: ☺
23/10/2019, 07:08 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about it
23/10/2019, 07:08 - Bee: You're awake?!
23/10/2019, 07:08 - Bee: Good morning!
23/10/2019, 07:08 - Bee: My day has been alright so far. I had a submission today and I thought I kept it in my bag but I didn't. 🤦🏻‍♀
23/10/2019, 07:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! So what now?
23/10/2019, 07:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it's 7 already. I need to leave by 8:15 if I want to reach on time
23/10/2019, 07:20 - Nischal Abraham: I mean there's not a lot to talk about. I was playing YuGiOh! (It's a fantasy card game based on the cartoon)
23/10/2019, 07:21 - Nischal Abraham: They had a video game section too... But there was a smash tournament and I've only played the game once in my life so didn't go for that
23/10/2019, 08:30 - Bee: I'll submit it tomorrow. The teacher was fine with it
23/10/2019, 08:30 - Bee: Oh I forgot that you're cycling to college
23/10/2019, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: I got late anyway so I'll be taking the bus. I guess it's all for the better since the CU will go on late today
23/10/2019, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: I cycled back home at night yesterday 😂. Terrifying experience. 10/10 would not like to do it again... But it gave me the confidence to if I needed to
23/10/2019, 12:09 - Bee: Why terrifying?! 😶
23/10/2019, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: There's no street lights on the road from Maynooth to Kilcock. Also the cycle path is locked off so I have to travel by the main road
23/10/2019, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: And I'm passing by just empty fields on both sides... Dotted by 1 or 2 houses...
23/10/2019, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and a cemetery is along that road as well
23/10/2019, 12:23 - Bee: Noooooo you've told me so many times that that's dangerous
23/10/2019, 12:24 - Bee: This is right out of a movie now
23/10/2019, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: I had my new lights so it's all good. And it's a straight road
23/10/2019, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: .
23/10/2019, 13:35 - Bee: ?
23/10/2019, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: .
23/10/2019, 13:35 - Bee: Kurt Hugo Schneider's covers are amazing
23/10/2019, 13:35 - Bee: ?
23/10/2019, 13:36 - Nischal Abraham: It was terrifying because it was dangerous and dark 😂
23/10/2019, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yea he's really talented. I haven't watched any of his recent videos
23/10/2019, 14:23 - Bee: OH. 😛 Got I now.
23/10/2019, 14:23 - Bee: It*
23/10/2019, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: Did I already brag about seeing KHS live?
23/10/2019, 16:29 - Bee: I think so? You didn't mention him but you mentioned Sam Tsui. Was it the same event?
23/10/2019, 16:29 - Bee: Do you want to brag again?
23/10/2019, 16:29 - Bee: Go on, Nischal
23/10/2019, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: It is the same event. Na I take no joy in bragging :P. But it was a fun concert
23/10/2019, 16:30 - Bee: :P
23/10/2019, 16:30 - Bee: The only concert I've been to was the Hillsong one
23/10/2019, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: How was college other than the submission issue?
23/10/2019, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Then I've just got one more than you 😂
23/10/2019, 16:31 - Bee: It was goood. But more submissions for tomorrow. Haven't started working on them yet
23/10/2019, 16:32 - Bee: I have another health talk tomorrow. In the hospital
23/10/2019, 16:32 - Bee: Waaaiiiiitt. I went to a Sheldon Bangera thing with Reenee and Ashley when I was 14
23/10/2019, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Then we're even on the concerts. I've only been to Hillsong once btw. Couldn't go the first year when everyone said it was good
23/10/2019, 16:34 - Bee: Good. I don't have FOMO then. :P I was in Kerala
23/10/2019, 16:35 - Bee: Waiting back for CU? Done with lectures?
23/10/2019, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! Sounds like you're week is pretty busy as well. But then again your every week is busy...
23/10/2019, 16:35 - Bee: Yes. Because holidays from Monday
23/10/2019, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: I am waiting back for CU. But still working on the lab assignment. This weeks is way more difficult
23/10/2019, 16:36 - Bee: Oh. Feels like a PG course now
23/10/2019, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: Sure does. I've got 2 more projects announced for individual subjects. They're submission is in December which I realised today isnt actually a lot of time 😂
23/10/2019, 16:43 - Bee: But it hasn't even been a month!!
23/10/2019, 16:43 - Bee: But it is a one year course
23/10/2019, 16:43 - Bee: 🤔
23/10/2019, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... It's been more than a month tho
23/10/2019, 16:45 - Bee: More than a month of lectures?!

23/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: Oh 😶
23/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: It doesn't feel like it's been that long
23/10/2019, 16:56 - Bee: But sometimes it does
23/10/2019, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: I know what you mean
23/10/2019, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Finally done with submission! And I've got a test tomorrow too 😅
23/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: Oh. How do you feel about that subject?
23/10/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: It's alright. I'll need to practice tonight though. Its databases and the professor is really good
23/10/2019, 17:46 - Bee: Oh

23/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: Why are you sad?!
23/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: Don't be sad!!!!!!
23/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: Nooo that's not why I said it
23/10/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Haha it's okay. You sleep well and I'll be fine

24/10/2019, 07:10 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby!
24/10/2019, 07:11 - Nischal Abraham: So there was more... They set up prayer stations with topics to pray about, like to pray for the university, or pray for the world and nations, or for the persecuted church
24/10/2019, 07:12 - Nischal Abraham: The prayer time was nice. And there was one station for Thanksgiving where you could write down a prayer of thanks for how God has been faithful
24/10/2019, 07:13 - Nischal Abraham: And I learnt the names of a few more people 😂
24/10/2019, 07:13 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debs! I'm praying for your day as well!! I hope you have an amazing one 😊
24/10/2019, 09:11 - Bee: Hey :)

24/10/2019, 09:11 - Bee: Are you suuuurrrreee? :P
24/10/2019, 09:13 - Bee: I'm going to start this!! It's a nice idea. I'm forgetful sometimes when it comes to God's goodness. This will help me look back and thank God
24/10/2019, 09:13 - Bee: I finished the health talk! It went really well. Considering it was in marathi
24/10/2019, 09:13 - Bee: It's been a good day so far

24/10/2019, 14:36 - Bee: Bible study where?!
24/10/2019, 14:37 - Bee: Have fun. :)
24/10/2019, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Just with Daniel and friends. They usually meet up once a week to study and pray. It'll be my first time joining them so I'm fuzzy on the details too
24/10/2019, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know how it goes :)
24/10/2019, 14:38 - Bee: Oh! Sounds nice. :)

24/10/2019, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like it's 2 hours of waiting now. How was the Bible study?
24/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: HI
24/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hey :)
24/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: Bible study was good. Stephen uncle spoke about the Laodicean church. Opened my eyes to a lot of lessons
24/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: How was your Bible study?
24/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: Waiting for rock climbing?
24/10/2019, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: My Bible study will be after the climb. And yep I'm waiting now
24/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: Oh! Late night then?
24/10/2019, 17:33 - Bee: I have college tomorrow. I'll get an extra hour of sleep

24/10/2019, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it'll be a late night for me
24/10/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Yes 😌
24/10/2019, 17:36 - Bee: I hope I don't waste those two weeks
24/10/2019, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: I hope I don't waste my only one
24/10/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: I've got LOADS of work lined up for me. Prof was like... "Oh a week off? here's a bunch of stuff to keep you busy"
24/10/2019, 17:37 - Bee: I might make a to-do list. That's on my bucket list. :P
24/10/2019, 17:37 - Bee: Whaaattt
24/10/2019, 17:37 - Bee: But it is called study week right
24/10/2019, 17:37 - Bee: Just today's?
24/10/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Is your bucket list on your to do list?
24/10/2019, 17:38 - Bee: Nope
24/10/2019, 17:38 - Bee: My bucket list is unrealistic
24/10/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
24/10/2019, 17:38 - Bee: 😛
24/10/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: I mean it's a lot of necessary work. And it IS study week so I should be studying... But still :(
24/10/2019, 17:39 - Bee: Aww Nischal
24/10/2019, 17:39 - Bee: You don't have to work all day though
24/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: No I don't. But I should. Well we'll see... I have a tendency to end up doing nothing which is not the outcome I want
24/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure it'll be fine. Are you planning on going to sleep now?
24/10/2019, 17:42 - Bee: No I just finished dinner. I was waiting for Ashley
24/10/2019, 17:42 - Bee: I'll sleep around 10:45
24/10/2019, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! That's nice and early ☺. When do you need to get up?
24/10/2019, 17:47 - Bee: Yes!! I just counted the hours of sleep I'll get and I was pleasantly surprised. Hadn't seen that number in a while :P
24/10/2019, 17:47 - Bee: I'll get up at 6:15 tomorrow
24/10/2019, 17:47 - Bee: I have to leave at 7:15
24/10/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Enjoy the rest! It's rare as it is
24/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: 😂.  
One more hour of waiting?
24/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I'm feeling hungry so I'll probably go to the shop and grab something. Needed to buy some stuff for tomorrow anyway
24/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: And I don't know how long this lab is open for :P
24/10/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Muffins? Biscuits?
24/10/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Something. I'll decide when I go there
24/10/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: It's almost bed time!
24/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: It is
24/10/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Goodnight :)
24/10/2019, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee! Enjoy long sleep 😊
25/10/2019, 00:09 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!!! Bible study was SO GOOD!!!!
25/10/2019, 00:10 - Nischal Abraham: So they're doing Phillipians. And they just started but just to have people to meet with together and study and discuss the Bible was such an encouragement
25/10/2019, 00:10 - Nischal Abraham: And we did it at McDonald's!!!!!
25/10/2019, 00:15 - Nischal Abraham: Just got home. Patrick was kind enough to drop me off... I'm so happy I think I'm going to cry
25/10/2019, 00:16 - Nischal Abraham: Well that and pray 😁. I couldn't wait to tell you tomorrow so I thought I'd just message now. Sorry for the excessive messaging
25/10/2019, 02:25 - Bee: HEY!!!!!!
25/10/2019, 02:25 - Bee: It amazing how God knows what we need before we even ask for it
25/10/2019, 02:26 - Bee: That's so good, Nischal!!!
25/10/2019, 02:26 - Bee: NO!!!!!
25/10/2019, 02:30 - Bee: Never be sorry for the excessive messaging!!! I was look forward to your message...to know how it went
25/10/2019, 02:30 - Bee: Looking*
25/10/2019, 07:57 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! 😊. Hope you have a wonderful last day of the week at college
25/10/2019, 12:27 - Bee: Hey!
25/10/2019, 12:28 - Bee: I hope it was the last day but it isn't. I have clinicals tomorrow
25/10/2019, 12:28 - Bee: How's your day going?
25/10/2019, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: Alright... Got late for my lecture... Then after 1.5 hours of lec he's given waaay too long a break till 2:30
25/10/2019, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Today just feels like a wasted day already. And it's reached proper Irish weather too. Constant rains with temperatures of 5-8 degrees 😂
25/10/2019, 12:37 - Bee: Oh. Doesn't he usually start late and finish early? Without a long break, that is
25/10/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Na that's the Thursday lecture :P. Today is Cryptography
25/10/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I got a call and couldn't reply earlier
25/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: Oh :P
25/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: No problem
25/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: Everything okay?
25/10/2019, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. All good... Was speaking to Helen chechi. The one in Portugal? I don't know if I told you about her
25/10/2019, 13:12 - Bee: Yes you did. Holiday plans?
25/10/2019, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I'm not sure how it'll work out but I just wanted to check with them first if they're free in December. Now I'll have to look into visa requirement and flight times and such
25/10/2019, 13:21 - Bee: Sounds exciting. Do you want to go?
25/10/2019, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: YES! I'd love to. Its a lot of things to do before I can though 😂. I'm just checking the requirements for travel now and it includes travel insurance and address documents
25/10/2019, 13:34 - Bee: Oh. Just checking :P you have enough time to plan the trip right?
25/10/2019, 13:34 - Bee: I just reached home. Early compared to the other days. Didn't have to wait ling for the bus  😌
25/10/2019, 13:35 - Bee: Long*
25/10/2019, 13:41 - Nischal Abraham: I guess... But my brain is telling me to rather just not do anything 😂
25/10/2019, 13:42 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. So what time will you have to leave tomorrow?
25/10/2019, 13:57 - Bee: WHYYY???!!!!! You get to visit a new country????!!!!!!!!!
25/10/2019, 13:57 - Bee: Same time. 6-6:15ish
25/10/2019, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: So much work. Procrastination is a strong emotion
25/10/2019, 14:10 - Bee: It is. Don't I know it
25/10/2019, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: But I really want to go and this may be my only chance to... So I'll try. And flight tickets are so cheap from here. It's cheaper than taxi fairs
25/10/2019, 14:15 - Bee: You should... It'll be something you look back at for many many years
25/10/2019, 14:15 - Bee: I could keep giving you reminders
25/10/2019, 14:16 - Bee: But I don't want to keep nagging you. Already :P
25/10/2019, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... How considerate. I'd appreciate nagging about this though. At least till the point where I'm definitely going or not going
25/10/2019, 14:22 - Bee: You have it then. Frequent reminders. Let me know when I start annoying you though
25/10/2019, 14:23 - Nischal Abraham: It's already annoying
25/10/2019, 14:23 - Nischal Abraham: Just kidding 😂
25/10/2019, 14:23 - Bee: Hawwwww
25/10/2019, 14:23 - Bee: It hasn't even been a minute!!!
25/10/2019, 14:23 - Nischal Abraham: I need it to be annoying. Otherwise I won't get anything done
25/10/2019, 14:23 - Bee: I thought you'd last longer!! 😂
25/10/2019, 14:24 - Bee: Got it. Noting that down. :P
25/10/2019, 14:24 - Bee: I want to get a haircut next week
25/10/2019, 14:24 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! What have I done
25/10/2019, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: What's stopping you?
25/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: And I'm feeling adventurous and want to go buy hair color just for the tips so that even if it turns out to be terrible I can choo it off
25/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: Chop*
25/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: Nothing at all. I will get a haircut next week
25/10/2019, 14:25 - Bee: Too late
25/10/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... Interesting. What colour are you going for?
25/10/2019, 14:30 - Bee: Red. Mostly. I should've thought of it earlier. Don't know where I'll find it. I'll still go check in stores though
25/10/2019, 14:31 - Bee: This sounds reckless doesn't it
25/10/2019, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: Do you plan on doing it before or after the hair cut?
25/10/2019, 14:31 - Bee: Before
25/10/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: Wouldn't the parlour just have hair colour? Or I guess it's cheaper to do it yourself
25/10/2019, 14:32 - Bee: It is cheaper
25/10/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: Then it isn't that reckless is it 😂
25/10/2019, 14:32 - Bee: I don't want fancy stuff. Just for a little while. :P
25/10/2019, 14:32 - Bee: That's why the hair cut after!!
25/10/2019, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: But seems like a waste of color if you're gonna cut it off anyway. Some people have wacky hair colours here in uni
25/10/2019, 14:33 - Nischal Abraham: The weirdest ones I've seen is always the bright neon pink ones. Like all of the hair 😮
25/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: In your college?
25/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: I don't feel so reckless now
25/10/2019, 14:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And on the streets
25/10/2019, 14:33 - Bee: Wow
25/10/2019, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm more shocked by the amount of money they must've spent 😂😂
25/10/2019, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Parlours are expensive here. VERY expensive
25/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: Oh no
25/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: What about your haircuts?
25/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: Whenever you need one
25/10/2019, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't needed one yet. I'd either have to be reckless or lazy I guess
25/10/2019, 14:36 - Bee: Do it yourself!!
25/10/2019, 14:36 - Bee: How bad can it be Nischal
25/10/2019, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: That's the reckless option 😂. Unlike your decision I can't correct it if it goes wrong
25/10/2019, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: You travelling home?
25/10/2019, 14:37 - Bee: You can. Get a buzzcut. You can do that with your trimmer
25/10/2019, 14:37 - Bee: I reached nana
25/10/2019, 14:37 - Bee: .
25/10/2019, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea! Forgot you said that... I was just thinking you're free since you're replying immediately
25/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: No nana
25/10/2019, 14:39 - Bee: I'm replying immediately because I love talking to you nanaaaaaaa
25/10/2019, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Aren't you being extra cute today
25/10/2019, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: It's super chilly today
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: You were typing this for so long?
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: Still raining?
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: Are you indoors?
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: Stupid question
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: You must be indoors
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Bee: To which question?
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
25/10/2019, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: Really does feel like 4
25/10/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
25/10/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/10/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
25/10/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Not really
25/10/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely not
25/10/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: One of them
25/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: You're not?!
25/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: Okay
25/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: At least the frog is cute.
25/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: Wasn't your lecture supposed to start at 2:30?
25/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: Thanks. ☺
25/10/2019, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'm skipping. Sitting in the lecture is making no difference to how much I'm understanding what's taught
25/10/2019, 14:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just study today's lesson from the book. There's no lab session for this so it's just another hour of lecture
25/10/2019, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: Have I told you about postgraduate lectures before?
25/10/2019, 15:10 - Bee: Bits and pieces?
25/10/2019, 15:10 - Bee: Oh
25/10/2019, 15:10 - Bee: On your way back then?
25/10/2019, 15:11 - Bee: Sorry for the delay. My little cousin video called
25/10/2019, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: On my way to more bouldering. Small group going today one last time before study week
25/10/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. My battery I running low anyway so I'll be offline till I get home again
25/10/2019, 16:55 - Bee: Awesome! Have fun 😊
25/10/2019, 17:06 - Bee: No store nearby had red dye. I bought burgundy instead. I don't know if it will be seen tho
25/10/2019, 18:55 - Bee: So the burgundy can't be seen at all 😂
25/10/2019, 19:11 - Bee: Nischal
25/10/2019, 19:12 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
25/10/2019, 22:53 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! Or morning when you read this
25/10/2019, 22:54 - Nischal Abraham: Did you apply it? Can I see? Burgundy doesn't sound like a great color anyway :/
25/10/2019, 22:54 - Nischal Abraham: Also does that mean you won't be cutting it till you get the right color or are you going to cut your hair anyway?
25/10/2019, 22:55 - Nischal Abraham: I had so much fun today too!! Bouldering is amazing! I wish I could share this with you
25/10/2019, 22:56 - Nischal Abraham: I guess it's one of those colours that would be more visible on lighter colour hair... Speaking of which I think any colour wouldn't be visible on black hair unless your bleaching beforehand
25/10/2019, 22:56 - Nischal Abraham: But I'm no expert so you make good choices 😊
25/10/2019, 23:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'm planning on sleeping in tomorrow... So I hope you have a great day! And I really hope we get to talk. It's been soooo long :(
25/10/2019, 23:33 - Nischal Abraham: Okay that's all. Goodnight!
26/10/2019, 04:41 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)))))))
26/10/2019, 04:42 - Bee: I did!! But it looks black. No change at all. I read online that it may look different in the sun so I'll check
26/10/2019, 04:43 - Bee: Oh. Red is better? :P
26/10/2019, 04:43 - Bee: I'll look for red but I'll cut my hair anyway. Amazon has red dye but it'll take a week and I don't want to wait that long for the haircut
26/10/2019, 04:43 - Bee: OH. Prime. I'll check.
26/10/2019, 04:44 - Bee: That's awesome!!! Did you try harder ones? 
Someday. ☺
26/10/2019, 04:45 - Bee: Red doesn't require the hair to be bleached..colors like blues greens pinks and yellows require bleached hair. I have a friend who colored her hair red and she told me that.. but I think bleached would've worked better. Hydrogen peroxide works as a good hair bleach. 😈
26/10/2019, 04:48 - Bee: I'm no expert either!
26/10/2019, 04:57 - Bee: You have a great day too! 
Find out what you need to do for the Portugal trip. DO IT!!!!
26/10/2019, 04:58 - Bee: Yep. It's been 4 days. I think that's the longest we've gone without talking. 
I don't know if we can talk today though :( Reenee, Arpitha, Sarah, and I are going out for dinner. I don't know when I'll be back
26/10/2019, 04:59 - Bee: Last day of work before holidays!!!!!!!!!!!!! ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
26/10/2019, 08:21 - Bee: Yawning newborns are the cutest!
26/10/2019, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: Red sounds more reckless 😋
26/10/2019, 09:11 - Nischal Abraham: I did! Really got pushed to go past my mental limits. It was so cool when I managed to complete them too!! I'm hoping to buy my own shoes cause paying 3.50 every time seems too much if I'm going regularly
26/10/2019, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: I really don't know anything about hair. I'm not even sure I take proper care of mine so...
I'm sure you'll look amazing regardless of what you do 😊(and you're going to cut it anyway so even if it's bad it's fine)
26/10/2019, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby ☺. I will do it. Had a nice long sleep and it's 9 now
26/10/2019, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's okay. You enjoy yourself! I'm free all of next week so I'm sure we'll find some time to talk 😊
26/10/2019, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo!!! Make the most of it(whatever's left of it anyway)
26/10/2019, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... They really are. And you get to be around so many of them 🥺
26/10/2019, 09:33 - Bee: Yep. Makes sense to buy your own
26/10/2019, 09:33 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. ☺
Yes! That's why I thought this would be the best time to experiment
26/10/2019, 09:34 - Bee: Cool. What's on your to-do list for today?
26/10/2019, 09:35 - Bee: Plans to dine out have changed. Now we're having a pyjama party :P
26/10/2019, 09:36 - Bee: Yeah :)
26/10/2019, 09:36 - Bee: I feel blessed
26/10/2019, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds fun!!
26/10/2019, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
26/10/2019, 10:13 - Bee: You wouldn't have cooked lunch if it wasn't on the list? 😯
26/10/2019, 10:13 - Bee: I hope you finish all the items
26/10/2019, 10:14 - Bee: 1 hour 17 minutes to go
26/10/2019, 10:14 - Nischal Abraham: I would take the easy way out and make noodles if I don't put "cook" in there
26/10/2019, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Basically anything I need to take time out to do is a to do
26/10/2019, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so too 😁
26/10/2019, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: How do you feel?
26/10/2019, 11:18 - Bee: Ecstatic
26/10/2019, 11:18 - Bee: 12 minutes to go!!
26/10/2019, 11:35 - Bee: 🤩
26/10/2019, 11:37 - Nischal Abraham: Countdown!!
26/10/2019, 11:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/10/2019, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: Actually you must be done now :P
26/10/2019, 11:40 - Bee: I am!!
26/10/2019, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your day!
26/10/2019, 11:43 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal :)
26/10/2019, 11:43 - Bee: I've been looking forward to this for so long
26/10/2019, 11:44 - Bee: I'm gonna spend time with all the kids!!
26/10/2019, 11:44 - Bee: What's up?
26/10/2019, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: On a call with a fried
26/10/2019, 11:45 - Bee: Okay
26/10/2019, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Done with the call. I was talking to Oriah in Israel. Just catching up on life and things 😁
26/10/2019, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the rest of the day. I'm just about to head out to buy stuff for lunch
26/10/2019, 12:17 - Bee: I'll go home and chill until I have to leave for Sarah's. Going for worship from there tomorrow
26/10/2019, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: Btw... On the risk of sounding stupid, who's Sarah?
26/10/2019, 12:20 - Bee: Samson's wife
26/10/2019, 12:20 - Bee: Little Nathan's mum
26/10/2019, 12:20 - Bee: Samson and Nathan are in Kerala for a week
26/10/2019, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that Sarah! OH!!!
26/10/2019, 12:20 - Bee: 😂
26/10/2019, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: That's so cool!! You're having a sleepover 😊
26/10/2019, 12:21 - Bee: YES!! I'm excited. We're ordering food and watching chick flicks. ☺
26/10/2019, 12:21 - Bee: In pyjamas!!!! No dressing yo and going out
26/10/2019, 12:21 - Bee: Up*
26/10/2019, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha. Sounds like your favourite way to spend a night out is to stay in 😂
26/10/2019, 12:28 - Bee: You're right. It is. 😄
26/10/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Today is a nice day 😊. Very sunny, no rains
26/10/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: It's nice and warm indoors
26/10/2019, 13:41 - Nischal Abraham: Is it still raining there?
26/10/2019, 13:44 - Bee: It drizzled today. It's so weird that it's still raining
26/10/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yea climate is changing pretty fast
26/10/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: But you must be enjoying that it's still raining 😁
26/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: I am :) but there's that thought in my mind that something is terribly wrong
26/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: Grocery shopping done?
26/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. But I had a late breakfast so I'm still not hungry 😂
26/10/2019, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably start cooking in 20 min
26/10/2019, 14:04 - Bee: Ah. It's a holiday thing
26/10/2019, 14:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. Well I'm just prepping the food till then. Slowly cutting and peeling
26/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: Oh
26/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: What's on the menu?
26/10/2019, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Good old steamed chicken with rice :P
26/10/2019, 14:58 - Bee: You must be a pro at it by now!
26/10/2019, 14:58 - Bee: I'm eating sweets
26/10/2019, 14:59 - Bee: Have I told you that I really really really like sweets?
26/10/2019, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. But I know you do
26/10/2019, 15:16 - Nischal Abraham: I guess... There's not a lot to it. I like it cause I only need one pan to do everything in
26/10/2019, 15:16 - Bee: So it's Diwali right. And every year there are patients or relatives of patients who give sweet boxes to papa
26/10/2019, 15:16 - Bee: During this time. And the options are amazing
26/10/2019, 15:16 - Bee: These are the too-sweet Indian sweets
26/10/2019, 15:17 - Bee: Can I call to say hi?
26/10/2019, 20:55 - Bee: I painted my toenails that new color
26/10/2019, 20:56 - Bee: Going to sleep now. Had a wonderful time, Nischal. :) A low-key perfect evening
26/10/2019, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds nice!
26/10/2019, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: It's pretty late. Don't sleep in tomorrow 😂
26/10/2019, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: You found the paint?
26/10/2019, 20:58 - Bee: No?
26/10/2019, 20:58 - Bee: That pretty blue-green color I talk about on Monday
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I remember... I meant nail paint
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Bee: I'll drink coffee. I'll be alright. Mind is in a good place. No sleep during worship tomorrow.
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Bee: Yes I did
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: You said you'd be looking for it. Didn't know you got it :P
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Bee: Heart full of Thanksgiving for all the things God has done
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Bee: I did!! 😈
26/10/2019, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's cool. Well I probably shouldn't keep you up any longer then
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Probably
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: It's almost late enough for me to go to sleep 😂
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Yeah?
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Isn't it 9:30
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Had dinner?
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: Almost... Not quiet. It's 9.
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Oh yes
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Made noodles
26/10/2019, 21:00 - Bee: Oh!! With veggies?
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: And I found a good flavored yogurt brand 😁
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Bee: If you're typing to tell me to go to sleep then I'm going
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Bee: Oh you weren't :P
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Bee: What flavor is it?
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes!!
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Bee: Going.
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: I got a 12 pack of 6 different flavours. Today was strawberry
26/10/2019, 21:01 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
26/10/2019, 21:02 - Bee: Oh!! Sounds fancy
26/10/2019, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! We'll talk tomorrow 😊. Hopefully... Maybe
26/10/2019, 21:02 - Bee: Hopefully
26/10/2019, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: Have a good Sunday!
26/10/2019, 21:02 - Bee: You too. :)
26/10/2019, 21:02 - Bee: Teach Anaya I Spy
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: Is that how her name is spelt?
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Bye bee. Sleep well
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: Bye.
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: I guess. Idk either
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: Okay
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the reminder. I'll do that :)
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: :)
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: Bye.
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Bee: 🤗
26/10/2019, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Byeeeeee
27/10/2019, 06:29 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
27/10/2019, 06:29 - Bee: Worship and the message was amazing today
27/10/2019, 06:29 - Bee: 😭
27/10/2019, 06:30 - Bee: Have a nice time of worship :)
27/10/2019, 07:11 - Nischal Abraham: So glad to hear it! Enjoy the rest of your day 😊. I'm sure you will with lunch and dinner out again 😂
27/10/2019, 07:11 - Nischal Abraham: And good afternoon to you too :)
27/10/2019, 08:52 - Bee: 😂 true. Sundays are the busiest!
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Btw. We're an hour more apart now
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Bee: How?
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Time is a funny thing. I don't know how daylight savings works either
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Bee: 😶
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Bee: I don't understand
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Bee: So it is 9 there?
27/10/2019, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: It's 8:53 now
27/10/2019, 08:54 - Bee: 😶
27/10/2019, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea crazy right 😂
27/10/2019, 08:54 - Bee: Whhhyyyyy
27/10/2019, 08:54 - Bee: Is it for the winter? Something like that?
27/10/2019, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea something like that... Or more like it was different for the summer and now it's back to normal?
27/10/2019, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'm at GMT+0:00
27/10/2019, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: India is at +5:30
27/10/2019, 08:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/10/2019, 08:55 - Bee: Oh
27/10/2019, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Either way... It is what it is :(
27/10/2019, 08:55 - Bee: Waaaiiiiitt all three have changed
27/10/2019, 08:56 - Bee: Yeah
27/10/2019, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yea India doesn't change so relatively everything else does 😅
27/10/2019, 08:56 - Bee: :(
27/10/2019, 08:56 - Bee: Shalini just came
27/10/2019, 08:56 - Bee: She's roasting now :P
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: Came from where?
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Bee: She had a morning shift
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Bee: She just came for lunch
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Bee: OH
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Bee: We're at Reenee's
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Bee: Did I tell you?
27/10/2019, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. Yea it is lunch time. I'm on the bus ride to Dublin
27/10/2019, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: What does this mean? 😂
27/10/2019, 08:58 - Bee: She is roasting other people
27/10/2019, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh 🤣🤣
27/10/2019, 08:58 - Bee: Do you remember Ben's farewell?
27/10/2019, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. She's roasted me too
27/10/2019, 08:59 - Bee: All of us had to say good things about ben and Shalini started with "when I first saw Ben I was scared"
27/10/2019, 08:59 - Bee: Oh yesssss
27/10/2019, 08:59 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
27/10/2019, 08:59 - Bee: The car ride
27/10/2019, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: Your memory is impeccable :P. Well what're you doing texting me? Go and get roasted!
27/10/2019, 09:00 - Bee: 😂
27/10/2019, 09:00 - Bee: She's having lunch. Otherwise I would've been roasted by now
27/10/2019, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I'm almost at my destination. I'll text you later
27/10/2019, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun!!
27/10/2019, 09:08 - Bee: Okay. You too!
27/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: At Patti's house for dinner
27/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: She taught us a cute game
27/10/2019, 14:45 - Bee: I'll tell you about it when we talk
27/10/2019, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: I was at a home for lunch as well. Just got dropped off to the bus stop. I'll tell you in detail when we talk :)
27/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Manaswi and Resham are here for a week!!
27/10/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Home cooked meal!! 😋
27/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: I am staying over at Reenee's. She has a holiday tomorrow.
27/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: Also, I'll make a to-do list if all the things I wish to do in the coming two weeks
27/10/2019, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yess! And it was an Irish American meal at that. Finally I get to eat the local cuisine
27/10/2019, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha 😂. That never gets old
27/10/2019, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Who's at the bottom left?
27/10/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yep you told me. Have fun!! Now you get to watch 3 chick flicks 😂😂
27/10/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I probably should too. Haven't been able to stick to my daily one's anyway but I like making lists 😋
27/10/2019, 19:12 - Bee: Whoa!! Must've been yum
27/10/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well... I'd choose Indian most days
27/10/2019, 19:13 - Bee: Arpitha yaaaaaa
27/10/2019, 19:13 - Bee: Oh. Because more flavor?
27/10/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: But it was good to try it out
27/10/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. But the lamb was good 😁
27/10/2019, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't she already do this before?
27/10/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Nooo. Not with Reenee. She'll just fast forward through the movie
27/10/2019, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: So you're just sitting and talking?
27/10/2019, 19:14 - Bee: She didn't!! I'm assuming she didn't. Why would she agree to do it again?!
27/10/2019, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Wait... Why are you on the phone 😶
27/10/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Yes we were. She is sleepy. She'll fall asleep in a minute
27/10/2019, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: You ain't sleepy?
27/10/2019, 19:15 - Bee: 😂 you are adorable. The first item on my list is already crossed out. It was 'Make a list' :P
27/10/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Not yet.
27/10/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: So you made a list!?
27/10/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Who else is there? Just the two of you?
27/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: Just the two of us
27/10/2019, 19:16 - Bee: I started making one
27/10/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: So what'll you do once Reenee is asleep?
27/10/2019, 19:17 - Bee: Ask you about your day?
27/10/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I woke up to a day that was an hour earlier than my body should be used to but it made no difference once I adjusted my watch
27/10/2019, 19:18 - Bee: I still can't wrap my head around that concept
27/10/2019, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yea me neither 😂. It turned dark by 5:30
27/10/2019, 19:19 - Bee: OH
27/10/2019, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: It looks like 10pm outside and it's only 7
27/10/2019, 19:20 - Bee: So if it would've been 4 1/2 hours then it would've been 8 rn. Wouldn't that make more sense?
27/10/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it might. But now is the original time. The summer time is the adjusted one
27/10/2019, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: So this is just winter in the northern hemisphere
27/10/2019, 19:21 - Bee: Okay? Okay.
27/10/2019, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Okay?
27/10/2019, 19:21 - Bee: I might have understood
27/10/2019, 19:21 - Bee: It's cool
27/10/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Don't try to understand it. Just accept that we're further away now 😭
27/10/2019, 19:23 - Bee: Trying to accept. We'll be alright, Nischal.
27/10/2019, 19:23 - Bee: I have a very good feeling about this.
27/10/2019, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: You have a good feeling about the time changing?
27/10/2019, 19:24 - Bee: No
27/10/2019, 19:26 - Bee: About our relationship.
27/10/2019, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just being dramatic btw. I don't care how much of a time difference there is we'll find a way to talk :P
27/10/2019, 19:27 - Bee: 😂 we will. :)
27/10/2019, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Are you still being antisocial?
27/10/2019, 19:27 - Bee: No
27/10/2019, 19:27 - Bee: Reenee is asleep
27/10/2019, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: How was the sleepover?
27/10/2019, 19:28 - Bee: Good!! We talked a lot and laughed a lot
27/10/2019, 19:28 - Bee: Made plans for the week
27/10/2019, 19:28 - Bee: Took cliche sleepover photos
27/10/2019, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yea? Btw I'm asking about yesterday
27/10/2019, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: But I guess we're on the same page
27/10/2019, 19:29 - Bee: We're not. I was talking about tonight.
27/10/2019, 19:29 - Bee: But similar stuff happened yesterday
27/10/2019, 19:30 - Bee: We didn't watch a movie though. These girls are so picky. Couldn't settle on one movie. We started 3 movies and dropped them within 10-15 minutes
27/10/2019, 19:30 - Bee: 🤦🏻‍♀
27/10/2019, 19:31 - Bee: So we just watched B-99 while we painted our nails. Which was nice
27/10/2019, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. Sounds like something I'd do just to irritate everyone else who wanted to watch a movie
27/10/2019, 19:31 - Bee: WHAT why?!
27/10/2019, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh. I need to watch season 6
27/10/2019, 19:32 - Bee: The last time Arpitha Reenee and I were at Sarah's we watched The greatest showman. And they kept talking throughout the movie!!
27/10/2019, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: To irritate people
27/10/2019, 19:33 - Bee: Oh no
27/10/2019, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Well learn your lesson... Only watch movies you've watched before 😂
27/10/2019, 19:35 - Bee: No no. I learnt that I shouldn't watch a movie with them unless we plan to watch it in a movie theatre
27/10/2019, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: Btw. If you don't mind me asking, what's cliche sleepover pics? I've never had an inclination to take pics... Ever. Let alone at a sleepover
27/10/2019, 19:35 - Bee: I'll send an old one. Wait
27/10/2019, 19:36 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/10/2019, 19:37 - Bee: I think it is a girl thing
27/10/2019, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: It probably is... Maybe that's what's cliche about it
27/10/2019, 19:37 - Bee: Maybe
27/10/2019, 19:37 - Bee: It is fun though
27/10/2019, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: I believe you... I'd just never imagine doing it myself
27/10/2019, 19:38 - Bee: Before I forget. About me sending you pins on Pinterest. You can go through them if you want to
27/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: 😂 we'll take some. Whenever
27/10/2019, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Na it's okay... The next time I open Pinterest will be when Siby aunty sends me another recipe
27/10/2019, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: And that'll take a while anyway
27/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: Okay
27/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: I think I overreacted
27/10/2019, 19:39 - Bee: I don't mind if you want to see them. That's all
27/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: You didn't. But you're definitely overthinking it now 😂
27/10/2019, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: I completely forgot about the whole thing. I told you I don't really use Pinterest. Also I think it's sweet you have things you want to save up for me to see later... I like that :)
27/10/2019, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: It's like a gift that's wrapped up and I just need to wait till it's time to open it
27/10/2019, 19:41 - Bee: Oh Nischal. Then there's more than pins. :) You'll be surprised
27/10/2019, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to it ☺. You sure you aren't sleepy? You barely slept last night as well
27/10/2019, 19:43 - Bee: I like the way you think
27/10/2019, 19:44 - Bee: I am a little sleepy
27/10/2019, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sleeping in tomorrow?
27/10/2019, 19:45 - Bee: Yes. 😌
27/10/2019, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: So whenever you want to go sleep you tell me okay?
27/10/2019, 19:46 - Bee: I will
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Bee: You were typing
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for tomorrow?
27/10/2019, 19:48 - Bee: Sleeping in, having a late breakfast and then going home to spend time with Manaswi and Resham. That's all
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Bee: I want to organize my shelves. I'll do that too
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea!! They're home! Excited?
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Bee: I am!! My eyes teared up when I saw them. They're all grown up now.
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Oh they must be so much older now
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Bee: Wise in their decisions
27/10/2019, 19:51 - Bee: Yes
27/10/2019, 19:51 - Bee: It's amazing to see how God is working in their lives
27/10/2019, 19:51 - Bee: 😭
27/10/2019, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: I can't even imagine. That's so cool... I hope you have a wonderful time with them 😊
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Bee: I know I will. Even if we just chill at home. I'm grateful to God that He placed them in my life... The way all of this worked out. It's amazing
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Bee: I'm in awe
27/10/2019, 19:53 - Bee: They are my baby sisters
27/10/2019, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: God works beautifully. So will you be cooking for them?
27/10/2019, 19:53 - Bee: 😂
27/10/2019, 19:53 - Bee: I'll ask them if they want to take the risk and then I'll decide
27/10/2019, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: Oh stop that. It's not a risk... I'm sure you can cook up something amazing for them
27/10/2019, 19:56 - Bee: 🥺. I'll cook tomorrow.
27/10/2019, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Did I pressure you. I'm sorry
27/10/2019, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: Texting is weird 😶
27/10/2019, 19:57 - Bee: No you didn't. You made me want to step out of my comfort zone. Which is good.
27/10/2019, 19:58 - Bee: We can stop if you want... And talk tomorrow
27/10/2019, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: No no... Don't go!
27/10/2019, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: Unless you want to... Then you should go
27/10/2019, 19:59 - Bee: I'm not going anywhere
27/10/2019, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: Doesn't that just mean I pressured you?
27/10/2019, 20:00 - Bee: You got me thinking
27/10/2019, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: So how was girls only lunch? Did Rolf join?
27/10/2019, 20:03 - Bee: He did!! Everyone was surprised
27/10/2019, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: 😮
27/10/2019, 20:05 - Bee: I showed them my magic trick and everyone was shocked :P and then we played Uno. And like every Uno game where there are many players and unwritten rules, it kept going on until lunch was ready. We didn't finished. Just got bored after a while
27/10/2019, 20:05 - Bee: Finish*
27/10/2019, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: Uno always ends by everyone getting bored 😂
27/10/2019, 20:05 - Bee: And then talked and took photos from Rolf's phone. So we're getting them only after two months because he never sends photos
27/10/2019, 20:06 - Bee: 😂. Yes. Only Reenee won.
27/10/2019, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: Ayy your getting good at your magic trick 😁
27/10/2019, 20:06 - Bee: And Sujata di cheats at Uno!!!! I learnt that today
27/10/2019, 20:06 - Bee: Hahaha. It's just that one. Which you figured out in less than 30 seconds.
27/10/2019, 20:06 - Bee: I was in awe then. I remember
27/10/2019, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. Tell Reenee to remind him
27/10/2019, 20:07 - Bee: She tells me to remind him!
27/10/2019, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: No way! Sujata doesn't cheat on anything... She's forever the nurse in mafia
27/10/2019, 20:07 - Bee: No but she cheats!! And she'll wiggle her way out. Very smart
27/10/2019, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: You did it twice... I wouldn't have figured it out if I only saw it once
27/10/2019, 20:08 - Bee: Kezia is pretty cool
27/10/2019, 20:09 - Bee: Oh. Rolf saw it twice but hasn't figured if out
27/10/2019, 20:09 - Bee: She loves Coke too 😋
27/10/2019, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yea? I'd love to meet all the new people there. I'll probably end up being awkward new guy anywho
27/10/2019, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Is that why she's cool? 😂
27/10/2019, 20:10 - Bee: You? Awkward new guy?!
27/10/2019, 20:11 - Bee: 😂
27/10/2019, 20:11 - Bee: Maybe. Not sure yet.
27/10/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: You're right. I'd be awkward old guy
27/10/2019, 20:11 - Bee: 😂
27/10/2019, 20:11 - Bee: You might be right
27/10/2019, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: That reminds me!!
27/10/2019, 20:12 - Bee: It's really nice. These young adults
27/10/2019, 20:12 - Bee: Tell me
27/10/2019, 20:12 - Bee: Visa?
27/10/2019, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: So everytime I'm offered tea or coffee I'm like I don't drink either
27/10/2019, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Which is followed for a weird stare
27/10/2019, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Then they're like do you want a fizzy drink, and I don't drink those either
27/10/2019, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: So I got this new line where I say I'm really old fashioned and all I drink is water
27/10/2019, 20:13 - Bee: 😂😂. Say wine!
27/10/2019, 20:14 - Nischal Abraham: But I don't really like wine either. That'll just lead to problems down the line
27/10/2019, 20:14 - Bee: Hot chocolate?
27/10/2019, 20:14 - Nischal Abraham: But I had an aloe vera drink today. It was interesting
27/10/2019, 20:14 - Bee: 😶
27/10/2019, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh. I do like hot chocolate
27/10/2019, 20:15 - Bee: Just the squeezed aloe vera pulp?
27/10/2019, 20:16 - Bee: Oh!! Do you know how to make it?
27/10/2019, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Well diluted with water. It's got bits in it
27/10/2019, 20:16 - Bee: Was it sweet?
27/10/2019, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. The machine does. But they make me pay €2 for it
27/10/2019, 20:16 - Bee: Oh
27/10/2019, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. It was kind of like coconut water but less sweet
27/10/2019, 20:17 - Bee: Will you drink it again?
27/10/2019, 20:17 - Bee: Nischal
27/10/2019, 20:18 - Bee: As much as I want to keep texting, I'm finding it hard to keep my eyes open
27/10/2019, 20:18 - Nischal Abraham: Go sleep
27/10/2019, 20:18 - Nischal Abraham: I won't be buying it for myself :P
27/10/2019, 20:19 - Nischal Abraham: It was fun chatting. Thanks for staying up this long :)
27/10/2019, 20:19 - Bee: Why are you thanking me?
27/10/2019, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee! Sleep in and get up at my wake up time 😁
27/10/2019, 20:20 - Bee: You just said it is weird
27/10/2019, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't it weird that I said it's weird? 🤣
27/10/2019, 20:20 - Bee: 🤔
27/10/2019, 20:21 - Bee: My brain cells are asleep
27/10/2019, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Don't think too much Debby. Some things in life are better left in the moment
27/10/2019, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Not understood
27/10/2019, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Now let your body cells sleep too. Goodnight!!
27/10/2019, 20:22 - Bee: Wise words by this really amazing man.
27/10/2019, 20:22 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
27/10/2019, 20:24 - Bee: Last message
27/10/2019, 20:24 - Bee: What about dinner?
27/10/2019, 20:24 - Nischal Abraham: Too full from lunch. Just had yogurt
27/10/2019, 20:25 - Nischal Abraham: Today was pineapple flavoured
27/10/2019, 20:25 - Nischal Abraham: It was good
27/10/2019, 20:25 - Bee: Okay. Done. Bye.

28/10/2019, 07:42 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Fingerprints Of God by Steven Curtis Chapman
https://open.spotify.com/track/2BBxUyyq9YIAWzo9JilP4o?si=10270JTcSSa72Z-SilOP7Q

28/10/2019, 07:44 - Bee: I'm still at Reenee's. Spoke to Ruth for a while. Hung out with Rolf for a while. Added stuff to my list. Not were just listening to music and talking
28/10/2019, 07:45 - Bee: I hope you have an amazing day, Nischal. :)
28/10/2019, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby!! It sounds like you're already having an amazing day 😁. Have fun!
28/10/2019, 08:12 - Bee: I am!!!!
28/10/2019, 08:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 08:17 - Bee: Talking*
28/10/2019, 08:39 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... You don't want him to?
28/10/2019, 09:13 - Bee: No no. I'm surprised is all
28/10/2019, 09:49 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice
28/10/2019, 13:07 - Bee: What's up?
28/10/2019, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: About to eat lunch. What about you?
28/10/2019, 13:24 - Bee: Woke up from an beautiful nap. Still at Reenee's
28/10/2019, 13:24 - Bee: May watch Modern Family
28/10/2019, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: Woah. Haven't gone home at all today? 😂
28/10/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Nope. I called Maa and she asked me to get a room here.
28/10/2019, 13:25 - Bee: :P
28/10/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Now there's no one at home. So I'll go whenever either parent returns
28/10/2019, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Well sounds like fun. I feel so lazy today
28/10/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Cold?
28/10/2019, 13:27 - Bee: Visa!!
28/10/2019, 13:27 - Bee: Started working on assignments?
28/10/2019, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: Not as much as yesterday. It's 10° today
28/10/2019, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: I knew you'd say that
28/10/2019, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: I should
28/10/2019, 13:28 - Bee: Should I have not?
28/10/2019, 13:28 - Bee: Oh!
28/10/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: You should... If anything I should say it more often to myself
28/10/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: It's just one of those moods 😩
28/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: Aww Nischal
28/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: Look it up now na
28/10/2019, 13:49 - Bee: Tell me what you find
28/10/2019, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... It looks like I might not be able to go after all. The GNIB resident card is a requirement for visa application and mine only gets issued at the end of November :(
28/10/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Oh no. Will that be enough time to apply for the Visa then?
28/10/2019, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: Probably not... I'll see. I'm just glad I checked
28/10/2019, 16:13 - Bee: Oh
28/10/2019, 16:13 - Bee: So no need to think about it until the end of November?
28/10/2019, 16:13 - Bee: How's your day going?
28/10/2019, 16:14 - Bee: I didn't finish any of the items on my list today
28/10/2019, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: I finished a few. None of the important ones though
28/10/2019, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Now I'm just eating cookies and drinking milk
28/10/2019, 16:24 - Bee: 😋
28/10/2019, 16:24 - Bee: I just reached home
28/10/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: That's a long time
28/10/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: You just spent a 2 day outing 😂
28/10/2019, 17:21 - Bee: 😂 yes. Time flies!
28/10/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Not feeling sleepy at all. Must have been the afternoon na
28/10/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Nap*
28/10/2019, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Did you have dinner there as well?
28/10/2019, 17:25 - Bee: Yes. Yesterday's leftover biryani
28/10/2019, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds delicious. Biryani always tastes better over time 😁
28/10/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Definitely.
28/10/2019, 17:40 - Bee: What are you doing?
28/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing really. Just got off the phone with my parents a few min back
28/10/2019, 17:41 - Bee: Oh!! Catch up call?
28/10/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. I'm feee
28/10/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Free*
28/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: .
28/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: ? ^
28/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: But sure. In 30 minutes? Doing stuff in the kitchen rn
28/10/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Oh!! I misunderstood 😂. Yea it was
28/10/2019, 17:45 - Bee: 😂
28/10/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: They're going to Bangalore in 2 days
28/10/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Ah
28/10/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Pondicherry?
28/10/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: I guess I'm just looking for any excuse to talk to you 😉
28/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: I think so... Not too sure myself
28/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi would know
28/10/2019, 17:46 - Bee: You don't need an excuse
28/10/2019, 17:46 - Bee: I'll ask her
28/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... And I got to have a long convo with Nidhi
28/10/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Which was just me rambling about stuff happening here... No cousins in Kerala this trip so she'll be bored as soon as she loses internet 😂
28/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: 😂
28/10/2019, 17:48 - Bee: But there'll be aunties who gush about how grown up she's become. Isn't that fun?!
28/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Well they aren't going to too many houses this visit
28/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Mom's sister had a leg injury so they're mostly just home
28/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: Oh no! How is she? Melvin's mum?
28/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. They went to the doctor today. Nothing too bad. No ligament tear, just a pull it seems. She'll have to rest up
28/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: I think she fell down in the house just a day or two before my parents got there... Anyway it's not too bad
28/10/2019, 18:18 - Bee: Ahh. At least she's got your mum around... Makes it easier for her to rest
28/10/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And added bonus... They're place has electricity and WiFi 😂
28/10/2019, 18:19 - Bee: 😂
28/10/2019, 18:19 - Bee: So Nidhi won't be bored
28/10/2019, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's true. She was asking my for songs today :P
28/10/2019, 18:28 - Bee: Hahaha
28/10/2019, 18:32 - Bee: I'm free. Let me know when you want to talk
28/10/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: I always want to talk to you
28/10/2019, 18:35 - Bee: Nischal
28/10/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'm free 😂
28/10/2019, 18:35 - Bee: 😂
28/10/2019, 18:37 - Bee: I'll call?
28/10/2019, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: .
28/10/2019, 20:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 20:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 21:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 21:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 21:55 - Bee: ♥
28/10/2019, 21:56 - Nischal Abraham: I do see the red on my phone
28/10/2019, 21:56 - Bee: 😯 really?!
28/10/2019, 21:57 - Nischal Abraham: If I zoom in then yea. Well the next time you do it you'll probably go all out eh?
28/10/2019, 21:57 - Bee: Nope. Just the tips. Maybe a brighter color
28/10/2019, 21:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Thought for another day. Now go sleep
28/10/2019, 22:02 - Bee: .
28/10/2019, 22:02 - Bee: Going. Bye. :)
28/10/2019, 22:06 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks :). Bye
29/10/2019, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Have a blessed day 😊. I got up pretty late
29/10/2019, 09:21 - Bee: Good morning!! I woke up at 8. Without an alarm. Had breakfast and then went back to sleep :P
29/10/2019, 09:21 - Bee: Busy day?
29/10/2019, 09:22 - Bee: I'm hoping I'll get a haircut today. Depends on whether Lakshmi is working a double shift or not
29/10/2019, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: So you won't get a haircut if she has a double shift?
29/10/2019, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: Wow. I woke up at 8 too. Without an alarm. Well now I'm at the breakfast stage so who knows maybe I'll fall asleep too 😂
29/10/2019, 10:18 - Bee: No. But she had a single shift!! So haircut today
29/10/2019, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Sounds like a trip. I haven't gone for a haircut with somebody since I was in school :P
29/10/2019, 10:18 - Bee: Did you fall asleep again?
29/10/2019, 10:19 - Bee: Hahaha
29/10/2019, 10:20 - Bee: Girls always go with another person. I don't know why. Maybe for moral support
29/10/2019, 10:21 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you'll need it if something goes wrong. Like the RMall incident
29/10/2019, 10:21 - Bee: But this time I don't mind short hair so it's coool
29/10/2019, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be cutting your hair short? 😮
29/10/2019, 10:22 - Bee: Not short short. Just a little past the shoulder short.
29/10/2019, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that's a lot of hair cut. If I cut off that much hair I'd go bald
29/10/2019, 10:24 - Bee: 😂
29/10/2019, 10:24 - Bee: Yes
29/10/2019, 10:24 - Bee: So it's Lakshmi Arpitha and I
29/10/2019, 10:24 - Bee: I am excited!!
29/10/2019, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: !!
29/10/2019, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds fun 😁. When do you go?
29/10/2019, 10:25 - Bee: Around 5. As soon as Arpitha finishes her work
29/10/2019, 10:26 - Nischal Abraham: If you don't mind me asking, how much does a haircut cost?
29/10/2019, 10:29 - Bee: Haircuts are good places cost around 600-700
29/10/2019, 10:29 - Bee: We're going to a cheaper place. So I think it will be around 350
29/10/2019, 10:29 - Bee: There's a place in vasant vihar
29/10/2019, 10:29 - Bee: We're going there
29/10/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Now I might not feel bad if I go for a haircut and it costs €10 😂
29/10/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: I actually have no idea how much hair cuts cost here... I should probably find out
29/10/2019, 10:31 - Bee: But aren't haircuts for women usually expensive
29/10/2019, 10:31 - Bee: Are*
29/10/2019, 10:31 - Bee: Yes! Cherian would know.
29/10/2019, 10:31 - Bee: OR one of your friends from college.
29/10/2019, 10:31 - Bee: Or the internet?
29/10/2019, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: Probably the internet
29/10/2019, 10:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... There's so much more maintanence there. But I guess even for guys if they want it styled a particular way it'll be expensive
29/10/2019, 10:50 - Bee: Yeah. Ashley once went for an expensive haircut but it didn't look like he had a haircut
29/10/2019, 13:44 - Bee: One item is checked off my list
29/10/2019, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: Get a haircut?
29/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: YES
29/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: 🤩
29/10/2019, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Good on you :). Happy with it?
29/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: I AM!!!!!!
29/10/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Exactly the length that I wanted
29/10/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear! 😁. How's your day been otherwise? Did anything after the salon?
29/10/2019, 13:47 - Bee: It was alright. Didn't do much until I left for the haircut. We're still here... Lakshmi is in the chair
29/10/2019, 13:48 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
29/10/2019, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. Haven't really done much of anything... I'll go shopping in an hour or so. Good excuse to get out of the house
29/10/2019, 13:51 - Bee: Ahh
29/10/2019, 13:51 - Bee: Lunch?
29/10/2019, 13:52 - Bee: I want to show you the haircut
29/10/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Done... Finished my leftovers so now I'll have to cook 😅
29/10/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Oh
29/10/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Trying something new?
29/10/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't there prayer meeting today?
29/10/2019, 13:53 - Bee: There is
29/10/2019, 13:53 - Bee: We're going straight from here
29/10/2019, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yep hoping to. I'm going through recipes trying to find a doable one
29/10/2019, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice. With the new haircut and all 😌
29/10/2019, 13:54 - Bee: Oh!! Rice dish?
29/10/2019, 13:54 - Bee: Yes
29/10/2019, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: Leaning towards fried rice dish, since I have leftover cooked rice still
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Bee: This is why we go with girls
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Bee: For photos
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Pretty!!
29/10/2019, 13:55 - Bee: Oh. So buying veggies?
29/10/2019, 13:56 - Bee: 🤩
29/10/2019, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: And the hair looks good too
29/10/2019, 13:56 - Bee: Thank you :)
29/10/2019, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe that's why guys go alone 😂
29/10/2019, 13:57 - Bee: 😂
29/10/2019, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. This time more economically so that I won't end up throwing them out when they get spoilt
29/10/2019, 17:06 - Bee: Hey!
29/10/2019, 17:06 - Bee: Went out for dinner with Reenee and Ben after the meeting
29/10/2019, 17:06 - Bee: He is leaving tomorrow night
29/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: I'm so happy with the haircut. I know it's not a big deal but I never was comfortable with short hair. I wanted to do something outside my comfort zone.
I found myself smiling throughout the haircut! ☺
29/10/2019, 17:14 - Bee: And I got my first bike lesson!!!
29/10/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: With your dad?
29/10/2019, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: I totally get it! That's how I felt when I went in to cut all my hair off... Though mine was more of a "I don't care how I look after this" situation
29/10/2019, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: How was it? You guys must be sad he's going. He must be sad he's going :(
29/10/2019, 17:18 - Bee: Yes! I didn't ride ride. Just a small distance. He was teaching about the gears and clutch and all of that
29/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: He's not sad... He is excited :) it was good to see him like that. We may go to marine lines to watch the sunrise tomorrow
29/10/2019, 17:21 - Bee: 😃 same!!! I just wanted shorter hair
29/10/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Bikes seemed so complicated to me. Maybe that's cause I haven't ridden any motorized 2 wheeler 😂
29/10/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! I'm trying hard not to fomo right now. You'll have to get up really early for that right?
29/10/2019, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: What time is he leaving though?
29/10/2019, 17:29 - Bee: I have ridden motorized 2 wheelers but still I'm saying bikes are complicated. And HEAVY.
29/10/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Yes. We're leaving at 5. Sunrise is at 6:38am tomorrow
29/10/2019, 17:29 - Bee: He is leaving around 10pm
29/10/2019, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yea bikes are heavy... But sounds like a fun morning! :D. Reenee doesn't have work?
29/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: I'm looking forward to it. Reenee will go to work from there
29/10/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... You could have breakfast somewhere as well and make a whole trip of it! Just the 3 of you?
29/10/2019, 18:05 - Bee: That's a good idea. We'll do that. It is the 3 of us
29/10/2019, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: So you'll be sleeping early tonight
29/10/2019, 18:09 - Bee: I know I should. But I'm not sleepy
29/10/2019, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Did I ruin your sleep cycle?
29/10/2019, 18:15 - Bee: You didn't. It is the holiday spirit
29/10/2019, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Haha :P. Well I'm not calling tonight otherwise you won't get up tomorrow
29/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Not even a hi? Hawww Nischal
29/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: I have the responsibility of waking Reenee up
29/10/2019, 18:22 - Bee: Don't know how I'm gonna do that
29/10/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: It'd be more of a bye call. And that'll just make us both sad
29/10/2019, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Who has the responsibility of waking you up? 😂
29/10/2019, 18:24 - Bee: Oh no. I. Again. How an I going to do that?!
29/10/2019, 18:24 - Bee: Am*
29/10/2019, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Want me to wake you up?
29/10/2019, 18:25 - Bee: What time are you going to sleep?
29/10/2019, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: You'll have to leave your net on... And the call would disturb everyone at home
29/10/2019, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: I can stay up for one night
29/10/2019, 18:26 - Bee: No don't stay up just to wake me up...
29/10/2019, 18:26 - Bee: I'll keep an alarm
29/10/2019, 18:26 - Bee: But thank you. ☺
29/10/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: I was going to stay up so I could get a call through in the morning 😋
29/10/2019, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: But if you'll manage with an alarm that's fine
29/10/2019, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 18:27 - Bee: :)
29/10/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Awwww.
29/10/2019, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: It's too watery 🙁
29/10/2019, 18:27 - Bee: Rice?
29/10/2019, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I was thinking bread since I already had rice for lunch
29/10/2019, 18:28 - Bee: Adding potatoes?
29/10/2019, 18:28 - Bee: It looks goooood!
29/10/2019, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know how it tastes :P
29/10/2019, 18:29 - Bee: You had all the masalas for chicken curry?!
29/10/2019, 18:29 - Bee: Looks fancy
29/10/2019, 18:29 - Bee: Okay. :P
29/10/2019, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Well I found a simpler recipe online. Was missing coriander powder... But I had chilli, turmeric and cumin
29/10/2019, 18:29 - Bee: Remember you can only get better!
29/10/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Positive thinking. I like it :)
29/10/2019, 18:30 - Bee: Ahh
29/10/2019, 18:30 - Bee: If only I could say that to myself
29/10/2019, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: And last time I spoke to mom and told her how complicated recipes online are... She just told me to ignore the stuff I don't have
29/10/2019, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: And then adjust with the stuff I do... So that's what I'm doing :P
29/10/2019, 18:32 - Bee: Sounds like amazing advice
29/10/2019, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: And I didn't have ginger either 😂. So garlic was all I added
29/10/2019, 18:33 - Bee: Oh. Did you have to grind the masala first? With tomatoes or something like that
29/10/2019, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Na... Everything was in powder form so I just added it straight in
29/10/2019, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: I had to (sort of) grind the tomatoes since the recipe said canned crushed tomatoes
29/10/2019, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: And I bought chicken stock just for the curry. There's plenty more of that so I can keep improving
29/10/2019, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: You should be sleeping. Its <5hours of sleep now
29/10/2019, 18:35 - Bee: Is chicken stock cheap?
29/10/2019, 18:36 - Bee: It was less than 5 hours half an hour ago... I'll leave at 5
29/10/2019, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: It comes in a pack of many. And you only need one cube for a LOT of curry
29/10/2019, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: DEBBY! SLEEP!!
29/10/2019, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not talking anymore. I'll update you after you're asleep. You can see my messages tomorrow
29/10/2019, 18:37 - Bee: Oh cubes. I was going to tell you about the cubes. Because there is canned chicken stock as well
29/10/2019, 18:37 - Bee: 😶
29/10/2019, 18:38 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!
29/10/2019, 18:38 - Bee: Okay then
29/10/2019, 18:38 - Bee: I'll go to sleep
29/10/2019, 18:38 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal
29/10/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee :)
29/10/2019, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 22:38 - Nischal Abraham: Hey I'm sorry about earlier... I could've put that across differently
29/10/2019, 22:38 - Nischal Abraham: And I just realised I don't really have to stay up if I wanted to give you a wake up call
29/10/2019, 23:08 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debs! Hope you get to enjoy a wonderful sunrise 😊. I'll be fast asleep when you do
29/10/2019, 23:58 - Bee: Nischal
29/10/2019, 23:58 - Bee: How come you're still awake?!
29/10/2019, 23:58 - Nischal Abraham: To make sure you're up silly
29/10/2019, 23:58 - Bee: 😂
29/10/2019, 23:58 - Nischal Abraham: Tell me you're on your way to see the sunrise
29/10/2019, 23:59 - Bee: Ben went out with his college friends after our dinner. And now he isn't in the 'right frame of mind'
29/10/2019, 23:59 - Bee: He sounded like he was in pain when I woke him up
30/10/2019, 00:00 - Bee: So we're not going
30/10/2019, 00:00 - Bee: You stayed up for nothing!! :(
30/10/2019, 00:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Sucks that you couldn't sleep in then
30/10/2019, 00:00 - Nischal Abraham: Planning on sleeping now?
30/10/2019, 00:01 - Bee: Nooo I'm fine. But the problem is that I'm not really sleepy now.
30/10/2019, 00:01 - Nischal Abraham: Did you wake Reenee up?
30/10/2019, 00:01 - Bee: I did
30/10/2019, 00:01 - Nischal Abraham: :(
30/10/2019, 00:02 - Bee: She'll be fine
30/10/2019, 00:02 - Nischal Abraham: Well I guess she needs to head to work anyway
30/10/2019, 00:02 - Bee: No it's okay, Nischal. :) I forget about sleep when I'm talking to you until my eyes shut themselves forcefully.
30/10/2019, 00:03 - Bee: Yes
30/10/2019, 00:03 - Nischal Abraham: I know. I'd do the same thing
30/10/2019, 00:03 - Bee: We'll meet Ben in the evening. Just for a bit because he's having a family thing
30/10/2019, 00:03 - Bee: Did it taste as good as it looked?
30/10/2019, 00:04 - Nischal Abraham: The curry could do with more flavour. It wasn't bad! The pita bread was really good so that compensated
30/10/2019, 00:05 - Bee: Oh!! Now you know how to make chicken curry!!!
30/10/2019, 00:05 - Bee: 🙌🏼
30/10/2019, 00:05 - Nischal Abraham: I think the curry was just too dilute. But like you said, it can only get better
30/10/2019, 00:05 - Bee: It will. :)
30/10/2019, 00:05 - Bee: What were you doing until 12?!
30/10/2019, 00:06 - Bee: I can see the sunrise here... But I don't know any good spots
30/10/2019, 00:06 - Bee: Too many buildings
30/10/2019, 00:06 - Nischal Abraham: YouTube, Netflix. With the internet there's a whole lot of time wasting possibilities
30/10/2019, 00:07 - Nischal Abraham: You could go trekking! But I guess it's no fun alone
30/10/2019, 00:07 - Bee: Yeah :(
30/10/2019, 00:07 - Bee: I don't want to go alone
30/10/2019, 00:07 - Nischal Abraham: You could be in Ireland and none of the buildings are taller than 3 stories
30/10/2019, 00:08 - Nischal Abraham: But the sunrise is all at an angle here. Noon is never overhead
30/10/2019, 00:08 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 00:08 - Bee: Can you see the sunrise?
30/10/2019, 00:09 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't looked for it. Either got up too late or been indoors
30/10/2019, 00:09 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe someday I'll get the excuse to look for it :)
30/10/2019, 00:11 - Bee: Yes!!!!
30/10/2019, 00:11 - Bee: You can't tomorrow though. You've been up so late
30/10/2019, 00:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yea not so soon. I did say somedau
30/10/2019, 00:11 - Nischal Abraham: Someday*
30/10/2019, 00:12 - Nischal Abraham: Well you should go enjoy your day Debby. I'd hate to take up your morning
30/10/2019, 00:12 - Bee: 😂
30/10/2019, 00:13 - Bee: You're not taking up anything
30/10/2019, 00:13 - Bee: I made a deal with papa. I'm making him breakfast. And then he'll take me to upvan lake to see the sunrise. ☺
30/10/2019, 00:14 - Nischal Abraham: Woah... You guys have a very early breakfast
30/10/2019, 00:14 - Bee: If I go to sleep now then i won't wake up before noon
30/10/2019, 00:14 - Nischal Abraham: Can you see the sunrise from upvan lake?
30/10/2019, 00:14 - Bee: Yes. This is when I usually have mine. Because I leave at 6
30/10/2019, 00:15 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea... But holiday mode!
30/10/2019, 00:15 - Bee: I don't know. :( I'll find out today
30/10/2019, 00:15 - Bee: But...
30/10/2019, 00:15 - Bee: Now I understand how you feel when I stay up late when we're talking.
30/10/2019, 00:15 - Nischal Abraham: Yea not today. I'm that way too... Once I'm up I'd rather just be up and get things done
30/10/2019, 00:16 - Nischal Abraham: What do you mean?
30/10/2019, 00:16 - Bee: I keep wanting to ask you if you're sleepy
30/10/2019, 00:16 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
30/10/2019, 00:16 - Bee: :P
30/10/2019, 00:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm good. I don't have to go anywhere tomorrow
30/10/2019, 00:16 - Bee: If you're sleepy, let me know okay?
30/10/2019, 00:17 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣. Sure thing
30/10/2019, 00:17 - Bee: :P
30/10/2019, 00:17 - Nischal Abraham: I realised after eating how early a dinner I had. I finished by 7
30/10/2019, 00:17 - Bee: Are you hungry now?
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Bee: Wow 7 is early
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. It was a heavyish dinner
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Nischal Abraham: So after the bread and chicken curry, I had a banana and a yogurt
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Nischal Abraham: Dinner was raspberry flavoured 😊
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Bee: What was the flavor?
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Bee: Oh!
30/10/2019, 00:18 - Bee: Have you found a favorite?
30/10/2019, 00:19 - Nischal Abraham: I like the berry flavoured ones so far. Strawberry is leading. Pear and pineapple were okay
30/10/2019, 00:20 - Nischal Abraham: So the yogurt has like tiny pieces of the fruit in it
30/10/2019, 00:20 - Nischal Abraham: Which makes it so yum 😋. I like this company... Better than the last ones I'd bought
30/10/2019, 00:20 - Bee: Haven't seen pear and pineapple flavoured here
30/10/2019, 00:20 - Bee: Do we have it here?
30/10/2019, 00:22 - Nischal Abraham: Idk. I've never had them before
30/10/2019, 00:22 - Nischal Abraham: I was told that there's a lot of variety of yogurt here in Ireland. So I'm trying out stuff
30/10/2019, 00:22 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't found a single packet of curd. So I guess that's not a thing
30/10/2019, 00:23 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't it breakfast time? You'll miss the sunrise if you stay home too long
30/10/2019, 00:24 - Bee: Ahh
30/10/2019, 00:24 - Bee: It is breakfast time. The omelette is on the pan
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Nischal Abraham: 😮. Impressive you're cooking and chatting at the same time!
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Bee: 😂
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Nischal Abraham: I need full concentration when I'm cooking
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Bee: Where there's a will...
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Bee: Omelettes are easy!!
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Bee: There's nothing to do
30/10/2019, 00:25 - Nischal Abraham: Well depends on what type of omelette
30/10/2019, 00:26 - Bee: I added onions and tomatoes
30/10/2019, 00:26 - Nischal Abraham: Speaking of... I can just imagine the omelette I'll have for breakfast 🤤
30/10/2019, 00:26 - Bee: And green chillies
30/10/2019, 00:26 - Bee: What type are you having?
30/10/2019, 00:26 - Nischal Abraham: Similar, I'll be substituting chillies with capsicum
30/10/2019, 00:26 - Nischal Abraham: Cause I hate chillies in my omelette
30/10/2019, 00:27 - Bee: Oooohh. Sure you aren't hungry?
30/10/2019, 00:27 - Nischal Abraham: I always end up biting them and then my tongue is on fire the whole meal
30/10/2019, 00:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not a midnight snack person
30/10/2019, 00:28 - Nischal Abraham: If anything, I've skipped dinners just cause I'd rather sleep
30/10/2019, 00:28 - Bee: I don't like chillies in mine either
30/10/2019, 00:29 - Bee: Maybe you've never been that hungry at midnight
30/10/2019, 00:30 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I've been hungry... I've just been tireder than hungry some days
30/10/2019, 00:30 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 00:30 - Bee: Do you stay up to watch football matches?
30/10/2019, 00:32 - Nischal Abraham: Na... I'd rather sleep if I have it my way
30/10/2019, 00:32 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 00:32 - Nischal Abraham: But my dad and Achu have made me stay up for matches before
30/10/2019, 00:32 - Bee: Ashley needs a variety of snacks when he stays up
30/10/2019, 00:32 - Bee: 😂
30/10/2019, 00:32 - Bee: You won't have to stay up since you're there now
30/10/2019, 00:33 - Nischal Abraham: Well I don't have to stay up cause I don't watch any matches anyway
30/10/2019, 00:33 - Nischal Abraham: And to rebuttal your point. I'm staying up now
30/10/2019, 00:33 - Bee: Are you sleepy?
30/10/2019, 00:33 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't have had to if I was there... Then we could've gone to see the sunrise
30/10/2019, 00:34 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. I'm past my sleepy phase
30/10/2019, 00:34 - Nischal Abraham: So I can just sleep whenever now. I'll go to bed when you're out
30/10/2019, 00:36 - Bee: Awwww. I would've loved that. :)
30/10/2019, 00:37 - Bee: Could've gone to Sanjay Gandhi
30/10/2019, 00:38 - Nischal Abraham: Or stuck to the original plan. Reenee was still in right
30/10/2019, 00:38 - Bee: Oh. I'll leave in 20
30/10/2019, 00:38 - Bee: Oh yeah
30/10/2019, 00:38 - Bee: I think she's asleep now. I'll not wake her up
30/10/2019, 00:39 - Bee: We planned to go in the morning because ben had plans for the evening
30/10/2019, 00:39 - Nischal Abraham: No don't. She'll have to head to work today as well so let her sleep if she wants to
30/10/2019, 00:39 - Bee: But I can go any evening!! I'll go before my holidays are up
30/10/2019, 00:39 - Nischal Abraham: Go to city?
30/10/2019, 00:39 - Bee: Yeah... Friday naybe
30/10/2019, 00:39 - Bee: Maybe*
30/10/2019, 00:40 - Bee: Yes. To marine lines. I'll come back with Reenee
30/10/2019, 00:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yea you could do that. Too bad Nidhi isn't around
30/10/2019, 00:40 - Bee: Yeah :(
30/10/2019, 00:40 - Bee: I know she would join
30/10/2019, 00:41 - Nischal Abraham: OH! Family camp will be fun for you guys!!! Fricky is speaking right?
30/10/2019, 00:41 - Bee: Yes!!!
30/10/2019, 00:41 - Bee: 21 days to go
30/10/2019, 00:42 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. Nidhi had such a packed travelling schedule this holidays
30/10/2019, 00:42 - Bee: Ikr?! One whole month of travelling!!
30/10/2019, 00:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yea! Enjoying life without her brothers around 😂
30/10/2019, 00:44 - Bee: 😂. Life without brothers. When will my time come :P
30/10/2019, 00:44 - Bee: Jk.
30/10/2019, 00:44 - Nischal Abraham: You had your time. When you left home to be in the hostel
30/10/2019, 00:45 - Bee: Noo it's different if I'm at home and there are no brothers around
30/10/2019, 00:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. Well if you ask Nidhi she might tell you it's worse
30/10/2019, 00:47 - Bee: Yeah
30/10/2019, 00:47 - Bee: I know I'll feel the same if it happens to me
30/10/2019, 00:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hey I just realised you've got 2 older brothers at home too!
30/10/2019, 00:48 - Bee: 😂
30/10/2019, 00:49 - Bee: Yesterday I got to see Jason after a while
30/10/2019, 00:49 - Bee: And we had a little argument
30/10/2019, 00:49 - Nischal Abraham: He got yesterday off right?
30/10/2019, 00:49 - Bee: No he was working
30/10/2019, 00:51 - Nischal Abraham: Fun or serious?
30/10/2019, 00:51 - Bee: Serious
30/10/2019, 00:51 - Nischal Abraham: You and Jason both seem like very similar people
30/10/2019, 00:52 - Bee: He said he could make me angry anytime and proceeded to do so. I didn't take that well
30/10/2019, 00:52 - Bee: Yeah? Oh. Never gotten that one before
30/10/2019, 00:52 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like something Nikhil would do
30/10/2019, 00:53 - Nischal Abraham: But that doesn't count as serious
30/10/2019, 00:53 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 00:53 - Bee: I cried at the end
30/10/2019, 00:53 - Nischal Abraham: Wow he's good
30/10/2019, 00:54 - Bee: 🙄
30/10/2019, 00:54 - Bee: Brothers
30/10/2019, 00:54 - Nischal Abraham: Or Nidhi just has bigger problems in life now. I've never seen Nikhil mess with her once she started architecture
30/10/2019, 00:55 - Nischal Abraham: That may have been because he was leaving as well so maybe that's the reason
30/10/2019, 00:55 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 00:55 - Nischal Abraham: Are you still upset about it?
30/10/2019, 00:56 - Bee: That's good... That he stopped
30/10/2019, 00:56 - Bee: I think I am. He didn't have to be so rude
30/10/2019, 00:57 - Bee: We're leaving
30/10/2019, 00:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. I hope it's just one of those things that don't really matter... But if you ever want to talk about it I'm here
30/10/2019, 00:57 - Bee: You can finally go to sleep :)
30/10/2019, 00:57 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Have fun! I'll go to sleep
30/10/2019, 00:57 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
30/10/2019, 00:58 - Bee: Thank you for staying up.
30/10/2019, 00:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby 😊
30/10/2019, 00:58 - Bee: It must be 1am
30/10/2019, 00:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I wish I could do it more often
30/10/2019, 00:58 - Bee: I hope you'll still be able to finish all that you plan for tomorrow
30/10/2019, 00:58 - Nischal Abraham: For once I'm not worrying about you
30/10/2019, 00:59 - Bee: But I am worrying about you
30/10/2019, 00:59 - Nischal Abraham: Just this once
30/10/2019, 00:59 - Nischal Abraham: Now go. See the sun
30/10/2019, 00:59 - Bee: :)
30/10/2019, 00:59 - Bee: Bye.
30/10/2019, 00:59 - Nischal Abraham: Bye!
30/10/2019, 04:53 - Bee: Couldn't see the sunrise from upvan lake but it was a beautiful morning
30/10/2019, 04:53 - Bee: I am spending today with Shiphrah akka and the girls :)
30/10/2019, 07:00 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/10/2019, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: Aww 🥺
30/10/2019, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun with the kids! I just got up
30/10/2019, 09:41 - Bee: Good morning!
30/10/2019, 09:41 - Bee: Just came back home. The kids are down for their nap
30/10/2019, 09:42 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be down for a nap as well?
30/10/2019, 09:42 - Bee: No... I slept for an hour after watching the sunrise
30/10/2019, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice... What do you have planned to do then?
30/10/2019, 09:52 - Bee: Nothing planned...I may watch something
30/10/2019, 09:52 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
30/10/2019, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Still planning. I need to make sure nothing in my fridge is going bad and use them today
30/10/2019, 10:04 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 10:04 - Bee: And assignments?
30/10/2019, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I need to do those 🙁
30/10/2019, 10:07 - Bee: You can do it nana! :)
30/10/2019, 10:08 - Bee: Breakfast done?
30/10/2019, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Na I'm making oats now
30/10/2019, 10:09 - Nischal Abraham: Bought berries yesterday to add to them
30/10/2019, 10:14 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/10/2019, 10:14 - Bee: Blueberries?
30/10/2019, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: Raspberry and blueberry
30/10/2019, 10:17 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 10:18 - Bee: I think I'll take a nap
30/10/2019, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Sleep well :)
30/10/2019, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Not yet anyway... There's still time 😁
30/10/2019, 12:40 - Bee: 😂
30/10/2019, 12:40 - Bee: I won't fall asleep. :P
30/10/2019, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: You didn't take a nap?
30/10/2019, 12:41 - Bee: Oh I did
30/10/2019, 12:41 - Bee: Just woke up
30/10/2019, 12:42 - Bee: .
30/10/2019, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: Ah you meant wrt the post
30/10/2019, 12:44 - Bee: Yessssss
30/10/2019, 12:44 - Bee: What's up?
30/10/2019, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Trying to figure out how the oven works
30/10/2019, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Wanna help?
30/10/2019, 12:47 - Bee: Yes
30/10/2019, 12:47 - Bee: Send a photo of the oven
30/10/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Can you hope onto a video call?
30/10/2019, 12:49 - Bee: A minute please
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: Ah it's fine if you're busy
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Bee: No I'm making coffee for the father
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: I can't see the place where the fire should go... I'm beginning to think it's electric
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Bee: Why don't you try to heat something
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Bee: Anything
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Bee: Just put it in and switch it on
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Bee: Or simply switch it on
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'm looking for a switch
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Bee: What's the brand name? Is there a model number written anywhere?
30/10/2019, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea... Found an instruction manual online for it
30/10/2019, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: Now I'll have to find out what it means
30/10/2019, 12:55 - Bee: Not in English?
30/10/2019, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: It's long
30/10/2019, 12:57 - Bee: Want me to go through it?
30/10/2019, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: I got it!
30/10/2019, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: There's a switch above the counter
30/10/2019, 13:00 - Bee: Oh!!!!!
30/10/2019, 13:00 - Bee: So frozen pizza?
30/10/2019, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. How do you preheat an oven?
30/10/2019, 13:02 - Bee: Just select the temperature and set it to hear
30/10/2019, 13:03 - Bee: Heat*
30/10/2019, 13:03 - Bee: Usually takes around 15 minutes
30/10/2019, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: 15 minutes to preheat?
30/10/2019, 13:04 - Bee: Yes
30/10/2019, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Wow ovens take long. And then another 10 for the pizza to be in
30/10/2019, 13:05 - Bee: Yes
30/10/2019, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... I'll get to it
30/10/2019, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: So what's up? I guess I just chill for the next many minutes
30/10/2019, 13:08 - Bee: I am drinking coffee and eating biscuits
30/10/2019, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a nice relaxing evening
30/10/2019, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Is it raining?
30/10/2019, 13:11 - Bee: Nope. No rain
30/10/2019, 13:11 - Bee: Hasn't rained since last week
30/10/2019, 13:11 - Bee: There?
30/10/2019, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it hasn't rained all week here either. Surprisingly
30/10/2019, 13:12 - Bee: Oh!! Good for you!
30/10/2019, 13:13 - Bee: The next time we talk, remind me to tell you about Ruth. Just say Ruth Pune
30/10/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... I'll try and remember to do that
30/10/2019, 13:15 - Bee: Okay
30/10/2019, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: Well enjoy your tea time. I don't really have a lot of news on my end since I'm home these days
30/10/2019, 13:18 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 13:18 - Bee: ?
30/10/2019, 13:18 - Bee: What are you going to do now
30/10/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Well now I'm waiting for pizza. After that I should get to assignments even though my whole body seems to be rejecting the idea 😂
30/10/2019, 13:22 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!! Do it for just 10 minutes. And then repeat 6 times.
30/10/2019, 13:22 - Bee: Or until your pizza is ready
30/10/2019, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: I know. Well pizza is ready so I'll do it after food
30/10/2019, 13:28 - Bee: Okay
30/10/2019, 14:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'm surprised I could finish one whole pizza myself
30/10/2019, 14:34 - Bee: How was it?
30/10/2019, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: Better than I expected! The bread was super soft
30/10/2019, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: And it didn't feel as unhealthy as dominoes
30/10/2019, 14:52 - Bee: Oh!! That's nice 😊
30/10/2019, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Did you get to meet with Ben?
30/10/2019, 14:53 - Bee: Yes. Met him for 5 minutes... He's having dinner with his family
30/10/2019, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it is his last night. How're you feeling?
30/10/2019, 14:57 - Bee: Yeah... I'm alright. It wasn't as hard as last time
30/10/2019, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: That's good
30/10/2019, 15:11 - Bee: :)
30/10/2019, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: So I did something productive! Researched a paper
30/10/2019, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
30/10/2019, 16:04 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 16:04 - Bee: Yay!!! For your project? The Thursday meet project?
30/10/2019, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep that one
30/10/2019, 17:52 - Bee: Hey
30/10/2019, 17:52 - Bee: How are you?
30/10/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Alright, why do you ask?
30/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: Just
30/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: No reason
30/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: How are you?
30/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: I'm alright :)
30/10/2019, 17:54 - Bee: How has your day been?
30/10/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Worse than it should've, better than it could've, if that makes any sense
30/10/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: My day is still going on though. I realise its only 6 and there's plenty of the day still remaining
30/10/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Your day however is almost over... So how has it been?
30/10/2019, 17:56 - Bee: It doesn't...
30/10/2019, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: I just mean it could've been a lot worse
30/10/2019, 17:57 - Bee: It was a good day. Checked another item off my list. :) Spending time with kids puts many things in perspective
30/10/2019, 17:57 - Bee: Oh
30/10/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Went out for a light dinner with the parents. That was good too...the time spent
30/10/2019, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Ashley?
30/10/2019, 17:59 - Bee: Ashley stayed back home. He was tired. We brought some takeaway for him
30/10/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: How so?
30/10/2019, 18:03 - Bee: This is something I've noticed with all kids. Again, may sound silly. But they never give up!! Sophia had this light box toy which she wanted to show me and it needed some setting up. She kept trying. For almost 10 minutes. And it did light up in the end. And at the total of sounding cheesy, the light box couldn't match the way her face lit up when it worked
30/10/2019, 18:04 - Bee: And throughout Makayla stood still looking at what Soph was doing. And you know kids. They can't stay still
30/10/2019, 18:04 - Bee: I really liked that
30/10/2019, 18:07 - Bee: And Makayla has had this persistent cough for the last week or so. And when we were playing she started coughing. And then Sophie looks at me and says Debby please pray for Makayla everyday. Her cough is troubling her
30/10/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Wow. Yea there's always something to learn... Especially from young ones
30/10/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: That's so sweet! My heart 😭
30/10/2019, 18:09 - Bee: Yeah
30/10/2019, 18:09 - Bee: I may visit Prachi didi and the kids tomorrow
30/10/2019, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like another fun day. How many other kids do you plan on meeting?
30/10/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Joyce's, Prissy chechi's
30/10/2019, 18:12 - Bee: I feel like I'm missing someone
30/10/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have enough time to visit more?
30/10/2019, 18:14 - Bee: I can make time
30/10/2019, 18:14 - Bee: Who do you have in mind?
30/10/2019, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: None come to mind at the moment
30/10/2019, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: So what do you do with them? Just play for a few hours?
30/10/2019, 18:16 - Bee: Yes!!! They don't get tired at all
30/10/2019, 18:16 - Bee: I feel so unfit beside them
30/10/2019, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: Kids are unlimited energy... I'll be surprised if you can keep up with Nathan (Samson and Sarah's)
30/10/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: What do you do when you get tired?
30/10/2019, 18:20 - Bee: I can't. I'm sure I can't
30/10/2019, 18:21 - Bee: I continue playing 🤷🏻‍♀ can't stop
30/10/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: I'm impressed. I burnout so quickly
30/10/2019, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Going to bed soon?
30/10/2019, 18:25 - Bee: Reading books is more tiring though. Sophia asked me to read her a Peter pan story and boy was it long. And with kids you can't just read right? You have to do all the different voices and sounds. That was tiring!
30/10/2019, 18:25 - Bee: Nah I'll be up for a while
30/10/2019, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... I can imagine. Never had to do that before
30/10/2019, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: No plans for tomorrow morning?
30/10/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Nope. I'll sleep in
30/10/2019, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just having early dinners everyday now. I can see why people do that here
30/10/2019, 18:48 - Bee: Why?
30/10/2019, 18:49 - Bee: Are you having dinner rn?
30/10/2019, 18:49 - Bee: What's for dinner?
30/10/2019, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'm making dinner right now. Boiling my leftover chicken before it goes bad. And I've got pita bread from yesterday
30/10/2019, 18:50 - Bee: Chicken curry is over?
30/10/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I'll probably eat that. Cutting some potatoes to add into it. I'm not following a recipe now so it's just figuring things out as I go
30/10/2019, 18:52 - Bee: Yeah. Pros don't use recipes. They just figure things out as they go. :P
30/10/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
30/10/2019, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Only a pro if I'm getting paid for it. Btw don't mind if my replies are a bit delayed. I find it difficult to text and cook at the same time
30/10/2019, 18:53 - Bee: No it's fine. You concentrate on the food. Let me know when you're done
30/10/2019, 18:54 - Bee: I'll let you know if I'm going to sleep
30/10/2019, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: What're you up to?
30/10/2019, 18:54 - Bee: Just lying down. Doing nothing
30/10/2019, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: It's not like I want you to go to sleep... But why aren't you just sleeping?
30/10/2019, 19:11 - Bee: So that I can talk to you
30/10/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Call?
30/10/2019, 19:12 - Bee: Are you asking me?
30/10/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm home alone and free all the time. Yes I'm asking if you're okay with a call
30/10/2019, 19:14 - Bee: I am. Did you finish cooking?
30/10/2019, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'm okay with a call :)
30/10/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: And I'm done cooking
31/10/2019, 04:51 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning. I guess it's actually morning this time :)
31/10/2019, 04:54 - Bee: Good morning! :)
31/10/2019, 04:54 - Bee: How come you're awake?
31/10/2019, 04:54 - Nischal Abraham: Good question
31/10/2019, 04:55 - Nischal Abraham: I still remember my dream too. Seems too dumb to write it down
31/10/2019, 04:55 - Bee: Oh. You woke up to write your dream down?
31/10/2019, 04:56 - Nischal Abraham: No nana. I woke up cause I'm not sleepy anymore. I mean I woke up an hour back...
31/10/2019, 04:57 - Bee: Oh. Not going back to sleep?
31/10/2019, 04:57 - Nischal Abraham: Tried to but I'm not sleepy. So I guess I just have an early start to the day
31/10/2019, 04:57 - Bee: That's good right?
31/10/2019, 04:57 - Bee: I'm getting ready to leave
31/10/2019, 04:58 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your day!
31/10/2019, 04:58 - Nischal Abraham: I guess so
31/10/2019, 04:58 - Bee: Wait it's not even 5 😶
31/10/2019, 04:58 - Nischal Abraham: It's almost 5
31/10/2019, 04:58 - Bee: Slept well?
31/10/2019, 04:59 - Nischal Abraham: I don't feel sleepy... Well I'll describe it exactly when we talk. You live your day. Mine's yet to properly start 😅
31/10/2019, 05:00 - Bee: Okay. You have a productive day, Nischal. ☺
31/10/2019, 05:01 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. You too!
31/10/2019, 05:02 - Bee: ☺🤗
31/10/2019, 09:28 - Bee: Hey :)
31/10/2019, 09:28 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
31/10/2019, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: I fell asleep again 😶. Just got up
31/10/2019, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been?
31/10/2019, 11:49 - Bee: Oh. What about lunch?
31/10/2019, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Well I did just finish breakfast
31/10/2019, 11:50 - Bee: It's been good so far ☺ just left their house. On my way with papa to apply for the driver's license. Another item on my list
31/10/2019, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: THAT'S AWESOME!!!
31/10/2019, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't you already have a learner's permit before?
31/10/2019, 11:57 - Bee: ☺
31/10/2019, 11:57 - Bee: I did. It's not valid anymore. I'll have to go through the whole process again
31/10/2019, 11:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... So planning on learning with your dad or going with the trainer?
31/10/2019, 11:59 - Bee: I didn't apply for classes. Just the license. Learning with my father 😶
31/10/2019, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: That's good! I think the classes are a waste of money anyway
31/10/2019, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: You don't really learn much from it... Everything I learnt was after getting a license
31/10/2019, 12:16 - Bee: Yep. I didn't learn much
31/10/2019, 12:17 - Bee: I'll try to be a good student this time. Since I have to learn from my father. :P
31/10/2019, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: Hehe. I'm sure you'll do just fine :)
31/10/2019, 12:21 - Bee: 😂
31/10/2019, 12:23 - Bee: Prachi didi did this 'curly girl' method on my hair. So now I have curly hair until my next hair wash
31/10/2019, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: How curly? Isn't your hair wavy as is
31/10/2019, 12:24 - Bee: It is wavy. But now there are proper curls
31/10/2019, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... Using curling irons?
31/10/2019, 12:26 - Bee: No. Using leave-in conditioner and hair gel
31/10/2019, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's why till the next wash... So how many weeks are you planning not to wash your hair?
31/10/2019, 12:27 - Bee: It is kinda complicated
31/10/2019, 12:27 - Bee: 😂
31/10/2019, 12:27 - Bee: I'll wash it in two days
31/10/2019, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: 😋
31/10/2019, 12:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/10/2019, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: That's cool! It's pretty gloomy here... Very cloudy but no skies
31/10/2019, 12:37 - Bee: Oh
31/10/2019, 12:37 - Bee: Cold?
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: The heater keeps the house warm
31/10/2019, 12:39 - Bee: Ah yes. 🤦🏻‍♀
31/10/2019, 15:55 - Bee: Nischal
31/10/2019, 15:56 - Bee: Can you give me playlist recommendations on Spotify
31/10/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: I normally just play my daily mixes, or the weekly uploads
31/10/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: By playlist recommendation do you mean a playlist that I've saved and listen to?
31/10/2019, 15:58 - Bee: Anything. That or one that's available
31/10/2019, 15:58 - Bee: I've been requested to make Dal 😎
31/10/2019, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0dLcvtg3Kz45nz7NshSBaf
31/10/2019, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: This is a cool one I found... Doesn't have the usual songs... and some are a miss. But it's got some good ones too
31/10/2019, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: In demand I see 😁. Who's the lucky guest?
31/10/2019, 16:02 - Bee: Listening to it
31/10/2019, 16:02 - Bee: Just us!
31/10/2019, 16:02 - Bee: What's up?
31/10/2019, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished lunch. Eating my yogurt. Listening to music since spotify is now open
31/10/2019, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: It's looking like it'll rain today
31/10/2019, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
31/10/2019, 16:21 - Bee: Oh!! Thunderstorms were in forecast here as well but nothing so far
31/10/2019, 16:21 - Bee: What's in that glass
31/10/2019, 16:21 - Bee: Is that a candle?
31/10/2019, 16:21 - Bee: Dal turned out fine
31/10/2019, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea that thing at the bottom is a candle
31/10/2019, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: That was quick
31/10/2019, 16:32 - Bee: Yep. I chopped stuff as I went instead of keeping everything ready before. Mother said that makes it quick
31/10/2019, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: Now who's the pro 😏
31/10/2019, 16:44 - Bee: 😂
31/10/2019, 16:44 - Bee: Just this once
31/10/2019, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: First of many. Its good! You should be proud :)
31/10/2019, 16:50 - Bee: :) I'm happy.
31/10/2019, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
31/10/2019, 16:53 - Bee: It was good. I woke up around 9 and left home at 10. We played board games, did some coloring, counted the number of cars they have (62), watched Veggie tales, had lunch, did the curly girl method on my hair, left around 5. Then went for the driver's license thing.
31/10/2019, 16:53 - Bee: Went for the Bible study after that. Stephen uncle finished his study on the letters to the seven churches
31/10/2019, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like an awesome day :D
31/10/2019, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: I changed my sheets, got my climbing shoes, sorted out my rent payment
31/10/2019, 16:58 - Bee: Oh you went out!!
31/10/2019, 16:58 - Bee: It was :)
31/10/2019, 16:58 - Bee: Is there rock climbing tomorrow?
31/10/2019, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: You know what... I'm going ahead and asking. It makes sense they didn't go today since today is Halloween
31/10/2019, 16:59 - Bee: OH yes. Ask!!
31/10/2019, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Sent a message on the group. Now I wait for a reply... Maybe for a very long time... Since today is Halloween
31/10/2019, 17:01 - Bee: Makes sense
31/10/2019, 17:03 - Bee: We also made paper pinwheels. And Anjali gifted me hers
31/10/2019, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Made!? What did you do for the stick?
31/10/2019, 17:04 - Bee: We used ice cream sticks. Origami pinwheels. They don't rotate with the wind. :P
31/10/2019, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Isn't the whole point of pinwheels to rotate?
31/10/2019, 17:12 - Bee: Those must be difficult to make then :(
31/10/2019, 17:12 - Bee: They are coming over for a sleepover next Friday. I've been told to learn some more origami for that day
31/10/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you've got assignments to do even on your holiday 😂
31/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Yes 😂 if only all assignments were like this
31/10/2019, 17:19 - Bee: What are you gonna do for the rest of today?
31/10/2019, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Finish up my exercise for the day later. And put the sheets to dry
31/10/2019, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: It's dark enough to be night already 😂
31/10/2019, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Man it does not feel like 5:30. What do you have planned?
31/10/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Nothing. I feel like playing some solitaire. No plans for tomorrow morning so I'll sleep in
31/10/2019, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: On the phone?
31/10/2019, 17:30 - Bee: On the laptop
31/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think I know how to play solitaire. Is that the one where you try to sequence all the cards?
31/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: Yes!!
31/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: This hasn't happened!
31/10/2019, 17:31 - Bee: But the time zone comment
31/10/2019, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
31/10/2019, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't it like 11pm in your timezone?
31/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: 😂😂😂😂
31/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: Hahaahaha
31/10/2019, 17:32 - Bee: What nanaaaa
31/10/2019, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: For all you know I'll be the one falling asleep
31/10/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Are you tired?
31/10/2019, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Na... I overslept in the morning
31/10/2019, 17:39 - Bee: Oh
31/10/2019, 17:39 - Bee: My solitaire spree has begun
31/10/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: How good are you at solitaire?
31/10/2019, 17:44 - Bee: I'm not that good. I play only up to the third difficulty level
31/10/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds pretty good to me. I think I've only played on the easiest difficulty
31/10/2019, 17:45 - Bee: I've been playing since I was 10. I should've been better at it by now. Papa is find of this game
31/10/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: My dad used to play minesweeper a lot. I've only been able to play the easiest of that one too
31/10/2019, 17:47 - Bee: I never knew how to play that until Nidhi taught me on August 15th
31/10/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: What was on August 15th?
31/10/2019, 17:53 - Bee: Sleepover at Reenee's
31/10/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: You were playing minesweeper!! When!?
31/10/2019, 17:55 - Bee: In the morning. I think you were with Rolf in the hall
31/10/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yea sounds about right. The rules of minesweeper aren't all too difficult. But it requires way too much patience to do the hardest difficulty
31/10/2019, 17:57 - Bee: And if it's the smallest tile size
31/10/2019, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Any chance of us talking tonight?
31/10/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Definitely
31/10/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Whenever you're free... I've got time before bedtime 😂
31/10/2019, 17:59 - Bee: What time is bedtime?
31/10/2019, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: 11pm
31/10/2019, 18:01 - Bee: Oh
31/10/2019, 18:01 - Bee: What are you going to do for 5 hours?!
31/10/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'll find something to do. Depending on how our talk goes I may not need to spend 5 hours
31/10/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Oh
31/10/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Can I call you in 15?
31/10/2019, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: .
31/10/2019, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep you can
31/10/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Cool
31/10/2019, 18:04 - Bee: .
31/10/2019, 18:21 - Bee: N
31/10/2019, 18:21 - Bee: Nischal
31/10/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2019, 18:21 - Bee: I'll call?
31/10/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2019, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: https://open.spotify.com/track/6YP6bn1Id1DgGkX5IB7zuh
01/11/2019, 06:01 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!! :)
01/11/2019, 06:02 - Bee: I slept in 😭
01/11/2019, 06:02 - Bee: I woke up at 10:30
01/11/2019, 06:02 - Bee: Nothing planned for today. The girls are home. They're planning something for papa for his birthday and apparently it's a surprise. Nobody knows but them.
01/11/2019, 07:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad 😊
01/11/2019, 07:20 - Nischal Abraham: When's his birthday?
01/11/2019, 07:21 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I managed to wake up on time 😁. I'm really praying for today to be a productive day
01/11/2019, 07:46 - Bee: It's on the 11th. But they're going back tomorrow
01/11/2019, 07:47 - Bee: Praying that you have a productive day. What have you planned?
01/11/2019, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: I've planned to start planning. Just finished with breakfast watching Age of Adaline. After that I'll let you know once plans are made
01/11/2019, 10:34 - Bee: Oh! I just watched Aladdin. The live action
01/11/2019, 10:39 - Nischal Abraham: I just cried. Good start to the day 😂
01/11/2019, 10:50 - Bee: Was it that bad?!
01/11/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: No no. I loved it! Just teared up for the last part.
01/11/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: It's a one time watch though. I don't think I'll ever watch it again
01/11/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm talking about Age of Adaline byw
01/11/2019, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: Btw*
01/11/2019, 10:51 - Bee: Fair enough. I watched it the second time with Joji uncle
01/11/2019, 10:51 - Bee: Yes
01/11/2019, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: How was Aladdin?
01/11/2019, 10:58 - Bee: It was good! I liked the songs. Loved the genie
01/11/2019, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good! I'll probably never watch that
01/11/2019, 11:00 - Bee: Because you prefer the original?
01/11/2019, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: I liked the theatre version at ncpa
01/11/2019, 11:03 - Nischal Abraham: Idk. I guess I'll only know if I watch the live action. Have you watched the original?
01/11/2019, 11:03 - Bee: I haven't
01/11/2019, 11:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Maybe you can compare them for me by watching the cartoon 🤣
01/11/2019, 11:14 - Bee: 😂
01/11/2019, 11:14 - Bee: Then I'm watching it like Reenee
01/11/2019, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure when Reenee watches movies on her own she watches them properly
01/11/2019, 11:23 - Bee: She watch The holiday on her own
01/11/2019, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yea but you said it yourself that it wasn't that good a movie
01/11/2019, 11:44 - Bee: That is true
01/11/2019, 14:39 - Bee: Hey
01/11/2019, 14:39 - Bee: How's your day going?
01/11/2019, 14:39 - Bee: It rained in the evening...I went for a long walk
01/11/2019, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Not bad... So last minute climbing decision was made 😁. Waiting for the bus now
01/11/2019, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: How was your walk?
01/11/2019, 15:10 - Bee: Oh! Excited?
01/11/2019, 15:10 - Bee: It was alright. More of an escape
01/11/2019, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: I am!!
01/11/2019, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: To clear your head?
01/11/2019, 15:53 - Bee: Yep
01/11/2019, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: Rough day? All okay?
01/11/2019, 15:56 - Bee: All okay. I'll tell you when we talk... Not a big deal
01/11/2019, 15:56 - Bee: You have fun!
01/11/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... You sure? I've still got time... I only need to check in before 5 and I'll probably reach in 15 min
01/11/2019, 16:00 - Bee: I'm sure. I was just sitting at home and brooding so I thought I'd go out for a walk
01/11/2019, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Okay :)
01/11/2019, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: You enjoy yourself! Hope you have a fun evening
01/11/2019, 16:04 - Bee: You too, Nischal. :)
01/11/2019, 17:54 - Bee: I don't think we can talk today :(
01/11/2019, 18:10 - Bee: I'm off to bed. Leaving at 7:45
01/11/2019, 18:10 - Bee: I'm sure you had a fun time.. after days spent sitting at home
01/11/2019, 18:10 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
01/11/2019, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it was nice getting out of the house finally. I was holed up for so long
01/11/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry we couldn't talk today. What do you have planned for tomorrow? I hope you have a good day 😊
01/11/2019, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! And good morning for when you see this
01/11/2019, 19:14 - Bee: :P hi.

01/11/2019, 19:14 - Bee: I get that feeling
01/11/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Glad you could go out.
01/11/2019, 19:14 - Bee: Goodnight! :)
01/11/2019, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes you told me. I didn't realise it was this Saturday. Be blessed! 😊
01/11/2019, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Here’s a song for you… A Man Named Job by Ryan Proudfoot
https://open.spotify.com/track/6ivXangjlCFKGJ3pMXgFrM?si=kzOTQYTlRxKjX7WdO_Q2Yw
02/11/2019, 03:57 - Bee: Good morning :)
02/11/2019, 03:57 - Bee: We're here!
02/11/2019, 07:37 - Bee: I hope you have a productive day, Nischal. :)

05/11/2019, 17:16 - Bee: Oh you went straight?
05/11/2019, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Otherwise it's another half an hour wasted
05/11/2019, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: You've kept off an assignment for so long 😮
05/11/2019, 17:23 - Bee: Yes :( I have to mail it by 10am tomorrow. I finished half the first day of my holidays. I plan to finish the rest it by 12am

05/11/2019, 18:47 - Bee: 😂
05/11/2019, 18:47 - Bee: How does it taste?
05/11/2019, 18:47 - Bee: It looks good!
05/11/2019, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: We'll chat later... Sorry for disturbing during your assignment

05/11/2019, 19:15 - Bee: Yes!!
05/11/2019, 19:15 - Bee: I had to mail it
05/11/2019, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. That's nice. So you can sleep in tomorrow now 😂
05/11/2019, 19:16 - Bee: No I want to wake up on time. I noticed that I wake up tired when I've slept in
05/11/2019, 19:16 - Bee: And I have just 4 more days
05/11/2019, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... It's good to break the habit early
05/11/2019, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'm getting up at 6:30 consistently now 😁. Though there's always a part of me that doesn't want to get out of bed still
05/11/2019, 19:18 - Bee: Yeah. Monday will be difficult otherwise
05/11/2019, 19:18 - Bee: Oh! No snoozing?
05/11/2019, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'm awake before the alarm... Then I have to fight off the inclination to snooze :P
05/11/2019, 19:21 - Bee: Whoa!!! Nice, Nischal!!!
05/11/2019, 19:21 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/11/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yea we'll see how long it lasts. I'm surprised I managed to finish up everything early today
05/11/2019, 19:22 - Bee: In college? Or before you left for college?
05/11/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Tomorrow is no cycle day so I need to make sure to catch my bus
05/11/2019, 19:22 - Bee: Because CU?
05/11/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Now. With dinner and bath
05/11/2019, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
05/11/2019, 19:23 - Bee: Oh
05/11/2019, 19:23 - Bee: Do you have work to do?
05/11/2019, 19:23 - Bee: Or rather are you plan on doing stuff?
05/11/2019, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing at the moment. I finished this week's submission work in college itself
05/11/2019, 19:23 - Bee: WOW
05/11/2019, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'll spend some time for project research later in the night

05/11/2019, 19:25 - Bee: Done! Around 9:30
05/11/2019, 19:25 - Bee: Just passing time
05/11/2019, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: When do you plan on sleeping?
05/11/2019, 19:25 - Bee: I slept for an hour after I came back because the kids wore me out
05/11/2019, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: OH! I wanna hear about your day!!
05/11/2019, 19:26 - Bee: I'll call you in 2?

06/11/2019, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: And good afternoon Debby!
06/11/2019, 09:06 - Bee: Cleaning the house is relaxing 😶
06/11/2019, 09:06 - Bee: But only when there's nobody around to tell you what to do
06/11/2019, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. You decided to clean the house on your own?
06/11/2019, 09:07 - Bee: 😂
06/11/2019, 09:07 - Bee: Yes!!!
06/11/2019, 09:07 - Bee: I was surprised
06/11/2019, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... That's nice. Did you get bored?
06/11/2019, 09:10 - Bee: Did I get bored and that's why I cleaned or did I get bored cleaning?
06/11/2019, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: The former
06/11/2019, 09:11 - Nischal Abraham: Unless I guess you're just the type of person who likes cleaning. Which is awesome cause I take so much effort to motivate myself to clean the house :P
06/11/2019, 09:11 - Bee: No
06/11/2019, 09:11 - Bee: I like cleaning
06/11/2019, 09:11 - Bee: BUT.
06/11/2019, 09:12 - Bee: I like looking at a clean place which once was messy
06/11/2019, 09:12 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... That's grand. Well my lecture's starting. Talk later :)
06/11/2019, 09:12 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear you're having a fun time
06/11/2019, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: I think you'll like the Marie Kondo show
06/11/2019, 09:15 - Bee: I'll check it out then
06/11/2019, 09:15 - Bee: Bye! :)
06/11/2019, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! How's the day going?
06/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: Hey :)
06/11/2019, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm really feeling the pressures of college again
06/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: The day is almost over.
06/11/2019, 17:01 - Bee: Tough day?
06/11/2019, 17:01 - Bee: This is a postgraduate course. It will be difficult. But you can do it! God is on your side
06/11/2019, 17:02 - Bee: Is it the pressure of studies?
06/11/2019, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I was going to say the same thing :P
06/11/2019, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: I don't like it when things go over my head... But it's a reality I have to accept
06/11/2019, 17:03 - Bee: You were typing
06/11/2019, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be fine. Just need to wrap my head around everything
06/11/2019, 17:04 - Bee: You will be more than fine. Let me know if you want to vent. Or just be distracted
06/11/2019, 17:04 - Bee: I got my second bike lesson today
06/11/2019, 17:04 - Bee: It isn't as difficult as I thought it would be
06/11/2019, 17:04 - Bee: But it's heavy!! I need my father's help to take it off the stand
06/11/2019, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Was it better than the first time?
06/11/2019, 17:08 - Bee: It was. I rode in a road where there were other vehicles
06/11/2019, 17:12 - Bee: On your way to CU?
06/11/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Nice Debby 😁
06/11/2019, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'm still in the lab. Getting some work done before CU
06/11/2019, 17:15 - Bee: Oh. I won't disturb you then
06/11/2019, 17:16 - Bee: I'm just getting ready for bed
06/11/2019, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Sleeping early?
06/11/2019, 17:20 - Bee: Maybe yes
06/11/2019, 17:20 - Bee: Because there's no chance of a phone call
06/11/2019, 17:20 - Bee: What time will you return from CU?
06/11/2019, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yea :(. Sorry but today is impossible
06/11/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Oh

06/11/2019, 17:21 - Bee: It's okay
06/11/2019, 17:21 - Bee: You have fun!
06/11/2019, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: You should sleep
06/11/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Let me know how it goes :)
06/11/2019, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Get used to getting up early 😁
06/11/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Yes I'll go to sleep
06/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Yes and that
06/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: For whenever you go to sleep, goodnight :)

06/11/2019, 17:33 - Bee: I'm sorry for disturbing you
06/11/2019, 17:33 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal
06/11/2019, 18:01 - Bee: I know I'm disturbing you but I really want to listen to your voice. Even if it's just for a minute on your way to CU. I'll be up for another hour or so. Let me know.
06/11/2019, 18:01 - Bee: I didn't think this through
06/11/2019, 18:01 - Bee: Maybe you're there already
06/11/2019, 18:01 - Bee: In that case, it's okay. Tomorrow.
06/11/2019, 21:43 - Nischal Abraham: Just got home. CU was good today. I think I was a bit distracted through the whole thing but the session was nice!
06/11/2019, 21:44 - Nischal Abraham: It was on stress and the speaker was sharing about dealing with stress as a Christian. Nothing new but a lot of reminders which is always needed
06/11/2019, 21:45 - Nischal Abraham: I mean the topic was "Stress"
06/11/2019, 21:48 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you get good sleep tonight!  Finally a day I'm not keeping you up 😅. Enjoy a wonderful day tomorrow Debby! Always in my prayers
06/11/2019, 21:48 - Nischal Abraham: And good morning for when you see this 😁
07/11/2019, 04:38 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!!
07/11/2019, 04:38 - Bee: I woke up early today!! 8am on a holiday counts as early right?
07/11/2019, 04:40 - Bee: Thank you for praying for me :)
07/11/2019, 04:40 - Bee: Reminders are good!
07/11/2019, 04:40 - Bee: Praying you have a good day, Nischal. ☺

07/11/2019, 08:55 - Bee: I slept around 12:15
07/11/2019, 08:55 - Bee: What error?!
07/11/2019, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: Of wasting my study week
07/11/2019, 09:36 - Bee: Oh no :(
07/11/2019, 09:36 - Bee: Is it the assignment?
07/11/2019, 09:36 - Bee: Didn't you finish that?
07/11/2019, 09:36 - Bee: Or just studying in general
07/11/2019, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: It's my project work. Which I haven't finished... Well I'm meeting him today and I don't know what I'm gonna say but I'll see how it goes

08/11/2019, 15:13 - Bee: Oh. I remember one Manjiri from when I came over during summer holidays when I was 8ish
08/11/2019, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yea she's our next door neighbour. Nidhi's childhood friend :P
08/11/2019, 16:14 - Bee: Oh!
08/11/2019, 16:15 - Bee: I'm having a hard time putting the kids to sleep
08/11/2019, 16:15 - Bee: I have given up
08/11/2019, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Cool aunt doesn't put the kids to sleep at 9:45 😮
08/11/2019, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: You let them stay up till 1 at least 😂
08/11/2019, 16:16 - Bee: What?! They are 4, 7, 8 years old!!
08/11/2019, 16:16 - Bee: Anurag is already asleep
08/11/2019, 16:16 - Nischal Abraham: Anurag is the only smart kid
08/11/2019, 16:16 - Bee: Yeah
08/11/2019, 16:17 - Bee: He had to go to Neev tomorrow
08/11/2019, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: You're right. They should sleep by 12
08/11/2019, 16:18 - Bee: 😱
08/11/2019, 16:19 - Bee: Giving them chocolate pie after dinner was a terrible idea
08/11/2019, 16:22 - Bee: Aren't you bouldering?
08/11/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that is a terrible idea 😂
08/11/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: On my way there. Waiting for the Luas
08/11/2019, 16:26 - Bee: Oh... What time will you be back home?
08/11/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Shouldn't be later than 10
08/11/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Depends on which bus I manage to catch
08/11/2019, 16:37 - Bee: Oh. I'd love to talk. If I'm too sleepy I'll message you.
08/11/2019, 16:37 - Bee: Have fun! :)
08/11/2019, 18:58 - Bee: Hey
08/11/2019, 18:58 - Bee: I'm sorry but I can't stay up any longer :( very sleepy
08/11/2019, 18:59 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
08/11/2019, 22:34 - Nischal Abraham: If I'd seen this earlier I'd have told you to go sleep and don't stay up. I'm sure you're exhausted with the kids today... And tomorrow morning too!
08/11/2019, 22:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad you're sleeping. I just got home now 😅. Today was a good day Debby. I'm really happy right now :)
08/11/2019, 22:36 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have an amazing day tomorrow too.
P.s. I'm home all day... If you ever want to talk just ring me up I'll probably be available
09/11/2019, 03:15 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
09/11/2019, 03:15 - Bee: It's okay. The kids slept at 12 😂 I ran out of bedtime stories. And then we played Dead lion :P
09/11/2019, 03:29 - Bee: I didn't win this time
09/11/2019, 03:31 - Bee: I'm so happy for you!! ☺ Looking forward to hearing about it :)
09/11/2019, 03:31 - Bee: Thanks. Yes I hope we get to talk. After I drop the kids off
09/11/2019, 03:31 - Bee: I don't know when that is though
09/11/2019, 06:10 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! When you say you didn't win dead lion... Does that mean you woke up first? Cause that sounds like a good thing
09/11/2019, 06:11 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time... Whenever if possible we will talk. If not I'm glad you're busy doing things you love :)
09/11/2019, 08:20 - Bee: They fell asleep before me. But also woke up before me. Jason and Ashley were there to entertain them until I woke up so it was okay 💁🏻
09/11/2019, 08:20 - Nischal Abraham: Haha that's kind of them. Jason wasn't sleeping?
09/11/2019, 08:20 - Bee: :)
But even after they leave.. everyone is at home!!! (But Jason is the main person I'm talking about)
09/11/2019, 08:21 - Bee: Nope. He tried. The kids didn't let him sleep
09/11/2019, 08:21 - Bee: Anurag went to Neev. Christopher had to go out somewhere. So we're down to Anjali and Ashish noq
09/11/2019, 08:21 - Bee: Now*
09/11/2019, 08:22 - Bee: What's up?
09/11/2019, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your time with them!
09/11/2019, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: I had a very early start to the day.... I may fall asleep before lunch for a while
09/11/2019, 08:22 - Bee: Oh!! Voluntarily?
09/11/2019, 08:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I just ended up awake. Its been raining a lot here... I think I woke up to the sound of rain on the window
09/11/2019, 08:24 - Bee: Oh. That's the best way for me to wake up. Not sure if it is for you though
09/11/2019, 08:24 - Nischal Abraham: Also my body is exhausted to the point where I couldn't fall back asleep 😂. So I just got up and started everything earlier
09/11/2019, 08:24 - Bee: Oh
09/11/2019, 08:24 - Bee: Had breakfast?
09/11/2019, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
09/11/2019, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: Had lunch?
09/11/2019, 08:52 - Bee: Yes
09/11/2019, 08:52 - Bee: Just dropped the kids off
09/11/2019, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: So how was the whole experience?
09/11/2019, 08:55 - Bee: It was that kind where you are in the moment but you know you're gonna miss it once it passes
09/11/2019, 08:55 - Bee: It was that during the whole sleepover
09/11/2019, 08:55 - Bee: I wish I had more energy to do more though
09/11/2019, 08:55 - Bee: Maybe next time. I'll start exercising from now :P
09/11/2019, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: Nice Debby. End with a joke
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: What joke?!
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: This?
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: A joke?!?!???!
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: I think yes.
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: Now I don't know what to do
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: The house was full now it's empty
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: You could do this
09/11/2019, 08:56 - Bee: What do I do now?!
09/11/2019, 08:57 - Bee: Naahhh. College and work from Monday. That's my exercise.
09/11/2019, 08:57 - Bee: I should start with cleaning
09/11/2019, 08:57 - Bee: There are paper planes everywhere
09/11/2019, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... The aftermath... Well now that you find cleaning relaxing I guess this is a fun activity too ☺
09/11/2019, 08:58 - Bee: BUT
09/11/2019, 08:58 - Bee: Even now. No energy at all.
09/11/2019, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: .
09/11/2019, 08:58 - Bee: What are you doing?
09/11/2019, 08:59 - Bee: That will have to wait for Monday
09/11/2019, 08:59 - Nischal Abraham: youtube.com/watch?v=dJO5Rewq1Ck
09/11/2019, 08:59 - Nischal Abraham: I don't get it. Sometimes it shows the preview and other times it doesn't :/
09/11/2019, 09:00 - Bee: That's a long video
09/11/2019, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: Not really... Well my threshold for video length has changed. Anyway its a cool series!
09/11/2019, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: I've been following it since he started it
09/11/2019, 09:01 - Bee: OH it's all music?
09/11/2019, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: It's not just one song. So there's a tune or melody they take and then 4 people modify it
09/11/2019, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: So a Producer is one of those sound mixing people who make EDMish music
09/11/2019, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: To put it in simple term
09/11/2019, 09:02 - Bee: Thanks. Makes a lot more sense now
09/11/2019, 09:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I normally don't like listening to EDM on its own... But seeing the process of them transforming a track into the final product is very awe inspiring
09/11/2019, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: There's a lot of EDM I've discovered through this... And I've learnt to appreciate the art even though I normally don't like the product
09/11/2019, 09:10 - Bee: I KNOW I can keep watching these if I let myself
09/11/2019, 09:11 - Bee: Not a big fan of EDM either but so much goes into it! That part I didn't know
09/11/2019, 09:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it's a LOT of effort. I understood that and stopped bashing on music I didn't listen to :P
09/11/2019, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: So what're you upto now? Gonna start cleaning?
09/11/2019, 09:13 - Bee: Oh. One of my friends started making EDM music and he would post bits and pieces of the process as stories on Instagram. That's when I tried to stop bashing EDM
09/11/2019, 09:14 - Bee: No. Just chilling for a while.
09/11/2019, 09:14 - Bee: Can I call you in 20?
09/11/2019, 09:14 - Bee: It may have to be a short call though. I have to go out with maa around 4
09/11/2019, 09:16 - Bee: Hey!! Pune was exactly a year ago
09/11/2019, 09:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yea no problem. I'd love a call :)
09/11/2019, 09:18 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh! A year ago today? Woah... Its been so long
09/11/2019, 09:39 - Bee: Nischal
09/11/2019, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
09/11/2019, 09:42 - Bee: Give me 2 minutes
09/11/2019, 09:43 - Nischal Abraham: Take all the time you need
09/11/2019, 09:47 - Bee: Nischal :P
09/11/2019, 09:47 - Bee: I should've said 5 minutes
09/11/2019, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay 😂
09/11/2019, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: I did say this
09/11/2019, 15:16 - Bee: Hey!!
09/11/2019, 15:17 - Bee: The tailor visit became grocery shopping which became dinner at house of momos. ☺
09/11/2019, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hii!
09/11/2019, 15:17 - Bee: What's up?
09/11/2019, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. With family?
09/11/2019, 15:17 - Bee: Just maa and I
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. Seems unfair to the boys
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Bee: 🤷🏻‍♀
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Bee: Jason isn't home
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Bee: Ashley would rather stay home
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Bee: 🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: Did you ask him?
09/11/2019, 15:18 - Bee: No?
09/11/2019, 15:19 - Bee: It was an impromptu plan!!
09/11/2019, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
09/11/2019, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: Poor Ashley. So you're done with dinner to then
09/11/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Yes
09/11/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Lunch?
09/11/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Done. I really need to buy stuff... But tiredness is really hitting me right now
09/11/2019, 15:21 - Bee: Oh you didn't sleep at all?
09/11/2019, 15:21 - Bee: Since you woke up
09/11/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: And with yesterday's climbing
09/11/2019, 15:22 - Bee: Oh
09/11/2019, 15:22 - Bee: What are you going to do then?
09/11/2019, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know
09/11/2019, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'm lazing at the moment
09/11/2019, 15:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/11/2019, 15:25 - Bee: Oh
09/11/2019, 15:25 - Bee: Beard?
09/11/2019, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Aww
09/11/2019, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: She's so cute
09/11/2019, 15:26 - Bee: Yes!!
09/11/2019, 15:26 - Bee: The only way she would look in my direction was if I said 'birdy'
09/11/2019, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: That can be done after dark
09/11/2019, 15:26 - Bee: Oh
09/11/2019, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: Why birdy?
09/11/2019, 15:27 - Bee: She likes birds
09/11/2019, 15:28 - Bee: A recent development
09/11/2019, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't everything a recent development for kids that age?
09/11/2019, 15:28 - Bee: You're right
09/11/2019, 15:29 - Bee: Aurag likes King Herod
09/11/2019, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. Which character are you?
09/11/2019, 15:36 - Bee: I'm Deborah
09/11/2019, 15:36 - Bee: You are Moses, in case you have forgotten
09/11/2019, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the reminder. I actually did forget 😂
09/11/2019, 17:38 - Bee: 😂
09/11/2019, 17:38 - Bee: How could you?!
09/11/2019, 17:38 - Bee: I just spoke to Norah!! Apparently she's been asking for me 😭
09/11/2019, 17:38 - Bee: Could today get any better?
09/11/2019, 17:39 - Bee: Yes!
09/11/2019, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! And she actually stayed on during the call?
09/11/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Yes. But she didn't look at the screen. She was just jumping around. But when the time came to say Bye, she came and said Hi Debbie
09/11/2019, 17:40 - Bee: So that's progress
09/11/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: That's good!!
09/11/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm starting on butter chicken. Just came back from my shopping trip
09/11/2019, 17:41 - Bee: WOW
09/11/2019, 17:41 - Bee: You were not joking
09/11/2019, 17:41 - Bee: You found all the ingredients m
09/11/2019, 17:41 - Bee: ?*
09/11/2019, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Well I found an easy 1 pan recipe. I'll see how it goes
09/11/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Cool
09/11/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Let me know if you have any doubts :P
09/11/2019, 17:43 - Bee: I'll Google and tell you the answer.
09/11/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Won't you be sleeping?
09/11/2019, 17:44 - Bee: Yes
09/11/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
09/11/2019, 17:44 - Bee: In 20
09/11/2019, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: There's time still for us to reach a stage where I ask you to Google things for me :P
09/11/2019, 17:46 - Bee: What stage?
09/11/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: When I'm sitting across the room from you and don't want to look at the internet
09/11/2019, 18:06 - Bee: OH. Just checking if we were on the same page
09/11/2019, 18:06 - Bee: Sorry for the late reply. Was getting ready for bed
09/11/2019, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep sleep. I've got my hands and eyes full anyway
09/11/2019, 18:10 - Bee: Eyes? Chopping onions?
09/11/2019, 18:10 - Bee: Going to sleep.
09/11/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
09/11/2019, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. It never gets easier
09/11/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Proud of you for trying butter chicken!! No matter how it turns out. (But for your sake, I hope it's good)
09/11/2019, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! :). I hope you have a wonderful day tomorrow!!
09/11/2019, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: Aww gee. Thanks
09/11/2019, 18:12 - Bee: You too, Nischal. :)
09/11/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
09/11/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Bye!
09/11/2019, 18:16 - Bee: I miss you. Now I'm done. Pakka. Bye.
10/11/2019, 06:30 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
10/11/2019, 06:30 - Bee: I hope you have a meaningful time of worship. ☺
10/11/2019, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Hope worship was good for you too
10/11/2019, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: And enjoy the rest of your day! Will you be meeting your friend today?
10/11/2019, 09:07 - Bee: No won't be meeting her today
10/11/2019, 09:07 - Bee: I drove around for an hour!!
10/11/2019, 09:16 - Bee: 0° 😶
10/11/2019, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! In the car or on the bike?
10/11/2019, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... It's not as bad as it sounds. Once you're wearing your jacket it's all warm inside
10/11/2019, 10:29 - Bee: The car
10/11/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo! Made it just in time for my bus 😌
10/11/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: I had a good time at worship. I hope your day went swimmingly too
10/11/2019, 14:48 - Bee: It did!
10/11/2019, 14:48 - Bee: Low-key and nice
10/11/2019, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: Nice ☺. I'm starving
10/11/2019, 15:05 - Bee: How was the butter chicken?!
10/11/2019, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: OH! I was supposed to send you the pic last night
10/11/2019, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: It looks good
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: It smells like butter chicken. But it tastes like normal chicken curry 😂
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: A Little thin in consistency?
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: How was it?
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: OH!
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: It's not bad though! It actually tastes really good
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: YAY!!!
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: Butter chicken!!!!!!!
10/11/2019, 15:07 - Bee: That's a big deal!!!!!
10/11/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Well... It's a messed up butter chicken. I know where I went wrong. Probably next time it'll come out better
10/11/2019, 15:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/11/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
10/11/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks
10/11/2019, 15:08 - Bee: :)
10/11/2019, 15:09 - Bee: I'll talk about complicated dishes more often now :P
10/11/2019, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Ready for tomorrow?
10/11/2019, 15:09 - Bee: Nope.
10/11/2019, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Mentally or are you just not packed?
10/11/2019, 15:18 - Bee: Both
10/11/2019, 15:19 - Bee: So many things on my mind
10/11/2019, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: You okay?
10/11/2019, 15:38 - Bee: I think so
10/11/2019, 15:39 - Bee: I feel like I wasted my holidays. I didn't do enough. And the course is going to be tougher than it ever was. And I haven't overcome my procrastination
10/11/2019, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds exactly like how I felt. But you didn't waste your holidays!
10/11/2019, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: You did so so many things. And you enjoyed every one of them. 

Nobody ever overcomes procrastination forever. You just do the best you can for every new task :)
10/11/2019, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: And you'll ace your course as you always have. If God has kept you there then He'll be with you through to the end. No matter how tough it gets
10/11/2019, 15:46 - Bee: Can I call you?
10/11/2019, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
10/11/2019, 15:46 - Bee: Now?

10/11/2019, 17:36 - Bee: Yes
10/11/2019, 17:37 - Bee: Oh! How is she doing? You would know better even though I see her more often
10/11/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: She's alright. Just the usual... Her dad still wants her to wait, she feels certain about things between her and Rolf
10/11/2019, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... it was mostly just me updating her on things going on at my end
10/11/2019, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh... You're the Dal expert now 😁
10/11/2019, 17:39 - Bee: Oh. More praying from my end then

10/11/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Maybe on another holiday
10/11/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's all I could offer too. She wanted to warn me about the same too. So sweet of her
10/11/2019, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Doesn't she make tadka?
10/11/2019, 17:41 - Bee: About the possibility of your parents wanting a Malayali for you?
10/11/2019, 17:41 - Bee: Yes. The nice kinda thick one
10/11/2019, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Not a Malayali specifically, but having their own expectations/decisions for me
10/11/2019, 17:42 - Bee: Oh

10/11/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Lessons on patience and trusting God
10/11/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Lessons which I learn only when I'm waiting

10/11/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so glad we're busy doing things where God wants us to be and yet able to share that experience with each other!
10/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: Nischal you'll make me cry
10/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: The good kind
10/11/2019, 17:52 - Bee: I thank God for you too.
10/11/2019, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nooo... Then you won't sleep on time! That's not my intention
10/11/2019, 17:52 - Bee: Thank you for praying for me. I don't deserve it but I am grateful

11/11/2019, 12:14 - Bee: Just for a bit. We have an old tradition of eating a piece of cake together on birthdays
11/11/2019, 12:15 - Bee: Hopefully after that I'll sit and finish stuff
11/11/2019, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like a great tradition to have! Anything involving cake and eating is good 😋
11/11/2019, 12:32 - Bee: Yes! I hope he chooses red velvet
11/11/2019, 12:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's his birthday Debby! Let him eat what he likes  😮
11/11/2019, 12:34 - Bee: That's why I'm not telling him to get the red velvet...I'm just wishing inside my head

13/11/2019, 07:05 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Well I'm assuming you'll be done with the ordeal by the time you read my message 😅. Sounds intense but I'm sure you'll enjoy this too :)
13/11/2019, 07:58 - Bee: It was beautiful, Nischal. I'm still in awe. I hope I never lose the wonder even after witnessing many more deliveries
13/11/2019, 07:58 - Bee: I assisted in a delivery for the first time!! 😭
13/11/2019, 07:58 - Bee: I haven't
13/11/2019, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that's amazing! I just thought maternity duty included delivery stuff as well
13/11/2019, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Learning something new every day
13/11/2019, 11:57 - Bee: Yes so I was posted in the wards, operation theatre, the OPD, NICU... But never the labour room
13/11/2019, 11:57 - Bee: 😌
13/11/2019, 11:58 - Bee: Escape room today? Or is it next Wednesday?
13/11/2019, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: It's next Wednesday. Today is a talk on Mental health and addictiob
13/11/2019, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Addiction*
13/11/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Are you still not home?
13/11/2019, 14:35 - Bee: I reached 15 minutes ago
13/11/2019, 14:36 - Bee: One labor case went on until 5:30 and I stayed back to assist
13/11/2019, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds busy... Will you be coming home late for the rest of your time there?
13/11/2019, 14:43 - Bee: My feet are killing me
13/11/2019, 14:43 - Bee: No. Just today
13/11/2019, 14:43 - Bee: I don't have to stay back if I don't want to
13/11/2019, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea... You must be standing the whole time 😮
13/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: One of my requirements for obstetrics is to assist in 20 deliveries. And I just got my first posting. So I thought I'll stay back because some days there are no cases at all but today there were mNy
13/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: Many*
13/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: Yes :(
13/11/2019, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: How much time do you have to assist with 20?
13/11/2019, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: And how many did you help with today?
13/11/2019, 14:47 - Bee: I'll have postings until April. But not always in the labour room. And when I have postings in the labour room, there may be no cases
13/11/2019, 14:47 - Bee: 2. Two other students were posted too and they took cases as well
13/11/2019, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: 20 does sound like a lot
13/11/2019, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: But for a population like Mumbai's you'd think its more often than not right?
13/11/2019, 14:50 - Bee: Yes!! But there's more to it. I'll tell you when you talk. If you're interested, that is. Wouldn't want to bore you with medical talk
13/11/2019, 14:50 - Bee: We*
13/11/2019, 14:50 - Nischal Abraham: But you had a good day today Debs :). I'm glad to hear it! The whole thing sounds scary to me but I love your description
13/11/2019, 14:51 - Bee: I did have a good day :)
13/11/2019, 14:51 - Bee: It looks scary too.
13/11/2019, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Me too. I finished my assignment early today. So sitting in the lab working on other pending stuff till CU time
13/11/2019, 14:51 - Bee: But there's so much more!!!!!
13/11/2019, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to hearing about it 😊
13/11/2019, 14:52 - Bee: Oh!! No lab today? I mean is there no professor
13/11/2019, 14:53 - Bee: 😊 soon!
13/11/2019, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: He's here... But only to solve any doubts we may have. Lecture for the day is done
13/11/2019, 14:54 - Bee: Oh. You're allowed to use phones?
13/11/2019, 14:54 - Bee: Hahaha. PG course. Ofc.
13/11/2019, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: We're allowed to use phones even during the lecture 😂
13/11/2019, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'm using my laptop though
13/11/2019, 14:55 - Bee: 😂
13/11/2019, 14:55 - Bee: Wow.
13/11/2019, 14:55 - Bee: I've never used WhatsApp on anything other than a phone
13/11/2019, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: Have I told you I love postgard labs
13/11/2019, 14:56 - Bee: Only about a hundred times? 😂 Definitely not enough.
13/11/2019, 14:56 - Nischal Abraham: Ah then I'll tell you again
13/11/2019, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yea WhatsApp is very limited on the laptop... I need it to be active on the phone as well to use it
13/11/2019, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Telegram is better in that sense
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Bee: So it's open on your phone as well?
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Since I can just directly chat without my phone being connected to the net
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Just need a network connection on the phone
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Bee: I just finished the chocolate pie that Prachi didi made. Now I don't know what to do
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Bee: I miss it already
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Which is actually limiting since the lab has low network connectivity
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Bee: Oh. Telegram yes
13/11/2019, 14:59 - Bee: No WiFi?
13/11/2019, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Noo! Well I need to stop eating sweets... I think it's making me feel weaker than usual
13/11/2019, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Cause last 2 days I've been eating that slice cake... and every morning I just feel more and more tired. I'm gonna try 2 days without and see how things go
13/11/2019, 15:00 - Bee: I was thinking about taking a break too. I don't know how long I can though. I was waiting for the chocolate pie and coke to get over. But the coke isn't over
13/11/2019, 15:01 - Bee: So after the coke gets over.
13/11/2019, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: Can't seem to set it up on the phone sadly :(. But managed to get my laptop working on it
13/11/2019, 15:01 - Bee: Oh...is that why you don't drink soda stuff?
13/11/2019, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. There is always something
13/11/2019, 15:02 - Bee: Hahaha. I hope not. At least for a week?
13/11/2019, 15:02 - Bee: Oh waaaiiitt
13/11/2019, 15:02 - Bee: Were there sweets during the family camp?
13/11/2019, 15:02 - Bee: I remember gulab jamun
13/11/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: Na that's just cause I don't like it. These side effects are recent notices. I generally don't eat sweets anyway so maybe my body is just not used to it
13/11/2019, 15:06 - Bee: Oh. I haven't spent more than two days without eating something sweet so I don't know how it affects my body
13/11/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
13/11/2019, 15:12 - Bee: All the more reason to do this
13/11/2019, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Sorry for the late reply. I was gonna type something then I got caught in conversation
13/11/2019, 15:20 - Bee: Don't be sorry, Nischal
13/11/2019, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: I've been watching some interesting information videos about sugar and it's harmful effects and thought now would be a good time to experiment with diet
13/11/2019, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Since I'm alone I can choose what and how to eat 😁
13/11/2019, 15:23 - Bee: Yeah... It's nice. The dedication.
13/11/2019, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Busy night tonight?
13/11/2019, 15:31 - Bee: Not really. Just dinner and then sleep
13/11/2019, 15:31 - Bee: Do you know what time you'll reach home?
13/11/2019, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be at the CU so probably late... I was hoping we could get time to talk before my CU. But it's okay if you have something to do :)
13/11/2019, 15:33 - Bee: No. Let me know whenever you're free :)
13/11/2019, 15:33 - Bee: I'll be here
13/11/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free anytime from now till 6:30
13/11/2019, 15:34 - Bee: Oh
13/11/2019, 15:34 - Bee: And the pending stuff you were doing?
13/11/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: So whenever you're free let me know :D
13/11/2019, 15:34 - Bee: I'll have dinner then. And then we'll talk?
13/11/2019, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: Not pending... More like starting early on work
13/11/2019, 15:35 - Bee: Oh
13/11/2019, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Take your time
13/11/2019, 15:35 - Bee: Is that okay?
13/11/2019, 15:35 - Bee: Okay
13/11/2019, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'll be around
13/11/2019, 16:12 - Bee: Hey
13/11/2019, 16:12 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
13/11/2019, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. I'm free too
13/11/2019, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: Call?
13/11/2019, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5
13/11/2019, 17:02 - Bee: Okay
14/11/2019, 00:54 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
14/11/2019, 00:55 - Bee: How was CU?
14/11/2019, 00:55 - Bee: My feet still hurt :(
14/11/2019, 02:19 - Bee: Maybe because I had no physical activity got two weeks
14/11/2019, 09:48 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! CU was a good time. It was a nice talk on stepping out of comfort zones to talk about your problems
14/11/2019, 09:49 - Nischal Abraham: Well if that's the reason then you should be fine in a day or 2. Just need to get used to it again
14/11/2019, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just realising how busy the rest of my week is
14/11/2019, 12:59 - Bee: Good afternoon!
14/11/2019, 13:00 - Bee: You're right. Im not as tired today
14/11/2019, 13:00 - Bee: So busy!
14/11/2019, 13:00 - Bee: Bouldering today!! 🤩
14/11/2019, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'm too worried about the things I need to get done before I leave tomorrow to enjoy today 😅
14/11/2019, 17:20 - Bee: On your way to bouldering?
14/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: I shall go to sleep now
14/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: 6 hours of sleep tonight!
14/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Have fun! And the motivation to get stuff done before the weekend.
14/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
14/11/2019, 17:22 - Bee: I had a good day today.
14/11/2019, 17:23 - Bee: Learnt something new in the labour room and it feels fulfilling
14/11/2019, 17:23 - Bee: Bye.
14/11/2019, 17:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/11/2019, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I'm so busy today
15/11/2019, 00:05 - Nischal Abraham: Today's Bible study was so blessed. Phillipians 2 led us to oneness and humility
15/11/2019, 00:06 - Nischal Abraham: And humility as thinking about ourselves less and what it would be like to give our all for Christ as we are called to but don't practically live it
15/11/2019, 00:07 - Nischal Abraham: One thing that came up which I thought was really cool is the passage that said the queen of Sheba travelled a long way to meet Solomon and yet a one greater than Solomon is here now
15/11/2019, 00:08 - Bee: HEY!
15/11/2019, 00:08 - Nischal Abraham: And how much of an effort do we take to meet Him
15/11/2019, 00:08 - Nischal Abraham: Oh hey! I thought you'd still be sleeping 😂
15/11/2019, 00:08 - Bee: I wish
15/11/2019, 00:08 - Nischal Abraham: Was spamming all these messages for when you'd get up and read
15/11/2019, 00:09 - Bee: Go on.
15/11/2019, 00:09 - Nischal Abraham: Are you getting ready for the day?
15/11/2019, 00:10 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll be heading to bed right after this... I just arrived home like 15 min back.
15/11/2019, 00:12 - Nischal Abraham: Another thought that came up was through Phillipians 2:12.. working out our salvation through _fear and trembling_. And it's not through joy and rejoicing because it's such a serious matter that maybe too many Christians and us aren't taking as seriously
15/11/2019, 00:13 - Nischal Abraham: And it's not just the moment of salvation but every moment of our Christian walk that follows that should be in the same attitude as well
15/11/2019, 00:14 - Nischal Abraham: So a lot of reality checks... Much needed always 😊. And tomorrow I'll be leaving!! Everything is happening so quick. I'm so excited!!!!
15/11/2019, 00:15 - Nischal Abraham: I've got an assignment I reeeeally want to finish tomorrow. Really praying I'll be able to. Today's meet with my supervisor was splendid 😭. I don't deserve this Debby. God's working things out like melting butter and I just can't seem to measure up
15/11/2019, 00:18 - Nischal Abraham: This is my alternative to us getting time to talk. I'll just spam you all the amazing ways God's working here and you can share in that joy in your own time :). I'm praying you have a great day ahead. One that really makes you know that God is guiding things through and gives you opportunity to praise Him more
15/11/2019, 00:20 - Bee: Hey. I want to take me time and read a your messages. Time which I don't have rn. Yes, getting ready for the day
15/11/2019, 00:21 - Bee: I'm sure you had a beautiful day.
15/11/2019, 00:21 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
15/11/2019, 00:21 - Bee: I'm praying for you
15/11/2019, 00:21 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. I'm glad you will take time to read it. This is the only one you need to focus on if you want to
15/11/2019, 00:22 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks bee. Goodnight!!
15/11/2019, 00:23 - Bee: Goodnight ☺
15/11/2019, 04:49 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!
15/11/2019, 04:49 - Bee: One of the best updates you've given ^^^^^^^^
15/11/2019, 04:50 - Bee: It's always exciting to discover new things from the Bible and it is so apt!!
15/11/2019, 04:57 - Bee: YAY!!!!!!!
15/11/2019, 04:57 - Bee: You're gonna make new memories!!!!!!!
15/11/2019, 04:59 - Bee: Aww Nischal. There is no one like our great God. We didn't deserve all of the good things He gives but He freely gives us anyway! :')
15/11/2019, 05:09 - Bee: This is you spamming? I know you can do better, Nischal! :P 
I'm happy we can share joys and sorrows even if we are soooooo far away.
15/11/2019, 05:09 - Bee: Thank you. I'm getting so many opportunities to learn and the responsibility here. I'm enjoying the labour room.
15/11/2019, 06:49 - Bee: Yeah. I studied this verse and chapter a few times because during the times when I had doubts about my salvation, I believed that this verse meant no could 'lose' my salvation of I didn't 'work' for it!
15/11/2019, 06:49 - Bee: I*
15/11/2019, 06:49 - Bee: If*
15/11/2019, 06:50 - Bee: It is a serious matter. I need to have that reverence and humility throughout my walk with God
15/11/2019, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. How's your day going? Got a super long lunch break so plenty of time to get my assignment done :)
15/11/2019, 13:36 - Bee: Hey! Day is going well. I'm not as tired as I was on Tuesday
15/11/2019, 13:36 - Bee: How's your assignment completion going?
15/11/2019, 13:36 - Bee: Packed for the weekend?
15/11/2019, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: It's pretty long. On the fence as to whether I'll be able to complete all of it on time
15/11/2019, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Got late for today's lecture since I had to pack and make sure the house was in order when I left
15/11/2019, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. One week is almost up since you started
15/11/2019, 13:53 - Bee: When do you have to submit it?
15/11/2019, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: He's given us time till Monday but I want to finish it off today and go for the camp without this thing in the back of my mind 😞
15/11/2019, 14:06 - Bee: Oh :( any way you can find time there to do it?
15/11/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Nooo... That's what I want to avoid 😭
15/11/2019, 15:28 - Bee: Update?
15/11/2019, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Lecture just ended
15/11/2019, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: So now I have an hour to finish my assignments before I leave
15/11/2019, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry I was really hoping lecture would end earlier and I'd be done earlier and then maybe I could get time to talk to you
15/11/2019, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: But I really really should finish this up now :(
15/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: HEY.
15/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: It's okay!!
15/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: Go finish that assignment!
15/11/2019, 17:01 - Bee: I'm praying that you do.
15/11/2019, 17:44 - Bee: I hope you're able to finish as much as possible, if not the whole thing
15/11/2019, 17:44 - Bee: I'm off to bed
15/11/2019, 17:44 - Bee: The weekend is finally here!!!!!! Camp!!!!!!
15/11/2019, 17:44 - Bee: :)
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Praying for a safe journey.
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: !!!!!!
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: DONE!!
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well sort of
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Bee: WOHOOO!!!!!!!
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Not submitting tonight... But I've done enough for it to be submitted
15/11/2019, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: So if I think of any changes later I'll add them in
15/11/2019, 17:46 - Bee: No assignment worry during the camp ☺
15/11/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep well Debby :). How does it feel with 6 hours of sleep?
15/11/2019, 17:46 - Bee: When do you leave?
15/11/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: YESS!
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Bee: Not used to this luxury
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Bee: And I hope I don't get used to it.
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well its a half hour walk to Paddy's house. So I'll leave in 10 min from the lab
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Some of us are meeting up at his place, have dinner and then leave together
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Bee: Oh!! Sounds exciting!!!!!
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Bee: 🤩
15/11/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: There's people from his home church who'll be meeting there... I'll be meeting A LOT of new people
15/11/2019, 17:48 - Bee: Lot of names to write down?
15/11/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yea and then 3 cars out for a road trip (its only an hour of a drive though)
15/11/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
15/11/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: I may forget to right down their names
15/11/2019, 17:48 - Bee: I hope it's a scenic drive. I'm sure it'll be
15/11/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: There'll be too many... Expecting 70 people at the camp. Which according to them is a huge number 😂
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Bee: 😂
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Bee: They should try ayc.
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Its already dark so the only scene I'll see is black
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: But Paddy said it's a beautiful place and I'll see it in the morning
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Oh 🤦🏻‍♀
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: DEBBY!
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: you should be sleeping :|
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Take photos!!
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Yes?
15/11/2019, 17:49 - Bee: Oh
15/11/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Yes.
15/11/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'll talk to you later. Yes I'll definitely take photos
15/11/2019, 17:50 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
15/11/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight bee :). I've decided to take photos this time for the trip. It may be horrible photos but I'll take them anyway 😂
15/11/2019, 17:50 - Bee: No problem of you can't. Talk later I mean. It just means you're really enjoying the camp
15/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: 😂
15/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: Better than nothing!
15/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: If*
15/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: I shall go now.
15/11/2019, 17:51 - Bee: Bye. :)
15/11/2019, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Well I didn't define later... So it'll probably be next week. Have a great day tomorrow!
15/11/2019, 17:52 - Bee: I will. :)
16/11/2019, 08:52 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
16/11/2019, 08:53 - Bee: I hope you have an amazing weekend. Its okay if you can't reply
16/11/2019, 08:53 - Bee: Bye!
16/11/2019, 17:55 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
17/11/2019, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!!!!
17/11/2019, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hiiii!!!
17/11/2019, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Sooo much has happened I can't even begin. I'll be talking for a whole day if I were to cover everything but it was an absolutely blessed weekend!
17/11/2019, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: There was no signal at all over there so I was in full radio silence mode and I'm kind of glad for it too cause I was completely involved with the camp then
17/11/2019, 17:23 - Bee: HI!!!
17/11/2019, 17:23 - Bee: I'm glad!!! I want to hear about it!! Whenever we talk
17/11/2019, 17:23 - Bee: I figured. Yes that's good :)
17/11/2019, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Today?
17/11/2019, 17:40 - Bee: In 20?
17/11/2019, 17:40 - Bee: 15*
17/11/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Cant speak for long though
17/11/2019, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright :). Its okay if you can't Debby. Got an assignment?
17/11/2019, 17:50 - Bee: No assignments. Kinda tired so I thought I'll sleep before 1
17/11/2019, 17:50 - Bee: 12*
17/11/2019, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's a good thought 😁
17/11/2019, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: You need all the weekend sleep you can get in
17/11/2019, 17:52 - Bee: I did nap in the afternoon
17/11/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: ALL the weekend sleep
17/11/2019, 18:07 - Bee: Hey
17/11/2019, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
17/11/2019, 18:08 - Bee: Are you free?
17/11/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
17/11/2019, 18:08 - Bee: Give me a minute
17/11/2019, 18:08 - Bee: I'll get the earphones
17/11/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: No problem
17/11/2019, 18:11 - Bee: Hey
17/11/2019, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hi again
17/11/2019, 18:12 - Bee: I'll call?
18/11/2019, 07:51 - Bee: Hey :)
18/11/2019, 07:51 - Bee: Good morning!
18/11/2019, 07:51 - Bee: I'm posted in the labour room again today
18/11/2019, 07:52 - Bee: 🤩
18/11/2019, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Enjoy your time in the labour room. I hope you get to be a part of many deliveries today 😊
18/11/2019, 09:21 - Bee: It's quiet in the labour room today
18/11/2019, 09:21 - Bee: Only two deliveries until now
18/11/2019, 09:22 - Bee: I got to assist in both!
18/11/2019, 09:23 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Well two a day is what you got even when it was busy so that's a good count 😁
18/11/2019, 09:28 - Bee: There are no patients in the waiting room either. It's just us!!
18/11/2019, 09:28 - Bee: I got to sit down for most of the day 😌
18/11/2019, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Rest day at the hospital for you. That must be rare
18/11/2019, 10:49 - Bee: Very. I didn't know what to do because there was nothing to do
18/11/2019, 10:49 - Bee: But it's good. I have a submission tomorrow and I'm not too tired to work on it
18/11/2019, 10:49 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/11/2019, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: It's been alright. Not ideal but not too bad. Didn't go to college today. I need to make sure I don't waste my time at home
18/11/2019, 13:02 - Bee: Oh
18/11/2019, 13:02 - Bee: Tired?
18/11/2019, 13:02 - Bee: I have this pounding headache and I think it's because I cut sugar
18/11/2019, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sort of. It just felt like the right decision to make
18/11/2019, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Are you sure it's not just because you haven't drunk enough water?
18/11/2019, 13:17 - Bee: Possible. I drank only 1.5 litres today
18/11/2019, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like a lot...
18/11/2019, 13:18 - Bee: It's not!!
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Or are you kidding? 🙄😂
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: I usually drink 2.5 litres
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: I still have a few hours tho. So it's not water
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I was being honest. I don't know how much you're supposed to drink
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: .
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: I drink when I'm thirsty
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Or when I see the signs of dehydration creeping in 😂
18/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: You feel thirsty when there's already a water deficit in your body
18/11/2019, 13:20 - Bee: Hahaha
18/11/2019, 13:20 - Bee: Drink more water!!
18/11/2019, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: I will 😊
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done for the day?
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Any more deliveries after?
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: I am
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Nope. Just the two
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: I have that assignment but I'll do it after a while
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Eating masala corn now
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: You're home already?
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: What's for lunch?
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: Yes
18/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: I took the share auto
18/11/2019, 13:26 - Bee: The headache was terrible. Didn't want to wait for the bus
18/11/2019, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. Maggi for lunch. I need to go buy stuff for dinner after
18/11/2019, 13:26 - Bee: Oh
18/11/2019, 13:26 - Bee: What are you planning to make?
18/11/2019, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Is it still hurting? Is texting fine?
18/11/2019, 13:27 - Bee: It is
18/11/2019, 13:27 - Bee: Texting is more than fine
18/11/2019, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Mom's old reliable chicken recipe. I have a lot of other stuff to get done today so don't want to spend too much time cooking
18/11/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: After the weekend away I had to throw away the milk and curd and the potatoes had gone bad. No matter how quickly I try to use them there's too many in one packet 😞
18/11/2019, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: I wish I had some right about now. The temperature outside has finally gone up so I don't mind heading out for shopping. Morning was terrible
18/11/2019, 13:34 - Bee: What are you going to get done today?
18/11/2019, 13:34 - Bee: Oh no! We don't get to pick the number like here? Prepackaged?
18/11/2019, 13:36 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
18/11/2019, 13:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yea everything is prepackaged. There's only a few vegetables that come loose but those are expensive by themselves
18/11/2019, 13:52 - Bee: Oh. Are those your notes?
18/11/2019, 13:53 - Bee: That reminds me.. I need to meditate on the passages for the family camp
18/11/2019, 13:54 - Bee: That sucks. Would've saved food from spoiling if loose ones were available
18/11/2019, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: On the left are the notes that Daniel shared with us
18/11/2019, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I know
18/11/2019, 15:13 - Bee: Oh
18/11/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Had an early dinner
18/11/2019, 15:14 - Bee: Will you be free to talk?
18/11/2019, 15:14 - Bee: I want to say hi
18/11/2019, 15:25 - Bee: Nischal
18/11/2019, 15:25 - Bee: I'm sorry I should've asked you earlier
18/11/2019, 15:25 - Bee: Can't bear the headache :(
18/11/2019, 15:26 - Bee: I'm going to sleep.. I cant do the assignment like this
18/11/2019, 15:26 - Bee: Hopefully I'll wake up early. Or get some time tomorrow
18/11/2019, 15:27 - Bee: I prayed that you'll be able to to complete everything you planned for today
18/11/2019, 15:27 - Bee: Goodnight, dearest Nischal.
18/11/2019, 15:27 - Bee: :)
18/11/2019, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no. I'm sorry! I was talking to Nidhi and didn't notice you'd messaged
18/11/2019, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby. It's the best thing I could receive
18/11/2019, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Rest well... In a way I guess it's good we couldn't talk so you get to sleep more
18/11/2019, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying that you'll be well enough to complete your assignment
18/11/2019, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... You called me dearest! Goodnight Debby :)

19/11/2019, 06:07 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
19/11/2019, 06:08 - Bee: I didn't complete it. I asked for an extra day
19/11/2019, 06:08 - Bee: I'm feeling completely fine today. :)
19/11/2019, 06:08 - Bee: Because you are.
19/11/2019, 06:08 - Bee: I hope you have a good day. :)
19/11/2019, 06:08 - Bee: Let me know!
19/11/2019, 06:08 - Bee: The place looks beautiful!! I'm sure the photos don't do justice
19/11/2019, 06:09 - Bee: Oh!! It's a nice book. Challenging. I need to borrow Choosing love
19/11/2019, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Just reached college. Managed to cycle today so feeling good 😁
19/11/2019, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: That's great news! Hope your day goes well too. Will you be in college?
19/11/2019, 09:27 - Nischal Abraham: The photos never do. And just the sound of the place in the morning is so good... I think there's a stream nearby and you could hear that
19/11/2019, 09:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well you'll have to wait a while if you want to borrow it from me
19/11/2019, 11:26 - Bee: Nope. Hospital this week. There's college on Saturday but I won't be going
19/11/2019, 11:27 - Bee: I'll wait
19/11/2019, 11:28 - Bee: Aw man! I listen to those sounds on Spotify sometimes but the real thing is always better of
19/11/2019, 15:29 - Bee: Hi Nischal!!! I hope your day is going well
19/11/2019, 15:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/11/2019, 15:30 - Bee: I'm having dinner. I'll start working on the assignment once I'm done. Not so tired because I slept quite a lot last night
19/11/2019, 15:31 - Bee: And the family camp is in 3 DAYS!!!!
19/11/2019, 15:32 - Bee: I had a good day. I was in the ward. So a lot of swaddling and teaching mums how to breastfeed.
19/11/2019, 15:33 - Bee: I'll be going for a medical camp on Friday!
19/11/2019, 16:48 - Bee: Finished the assignment!!
19/11/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a great day 😁. Finished assignment, swaddling babies... Could it get any better?
19/11/2019, 16:57 - Bee: 😄
19/11/2019, 16:57 - Bee: What time will you reach home?
19/11/2019, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Just left. Safe bet is another hour
19/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: Oh
19/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: I should go to sleep before that :(
19/11/2019, 17:00 - Bee: Just today
19/11/2019, 17:01 - Bee: I'm leaving extra early tomorrow because the patient I selected for my case study is undergoing a C-section
19/11/2019, 17:01 - Bee: And I have to be there in the OT for that
19/11/2019, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you should definitely sleep
19/11/2019, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm trying to navigate back home on the cycle
19/11/2019, 17:03 - Bee: Oh! Sorry.
19/11/2019, 17:03 - Bee: And I'm sorry we can't talk.
19/11/2019, 17:05 - Bee: :(
19/11/2019, 17:05 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal.
19/11/2019, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry too :(. Goodnight!
19/11/2019, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: It's tough to keep the spirit up when everything keeps moving down. 

It's like the closer I feel I'm getting to experiencing God the way He wants me to, the tougher and tougher it gets
19/11/2019, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: That is pretty well thought out
19/11/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't Friday when you'll be leaving for the camp?
19/11/2019, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a good opportunity to learn. Have you been a part of a C-section before?
19/11/2019, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Please don't be... I've been really bad at managing my time. But lately I'm just always busy but not getting anything done
19/11/2019, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: We'll have many plenty of opportunities to talk. And so so much to talk about. In fact I'm sure we'll get so much time that we'll run out of things to talk about (which isn't saying much cause we're silent on the phone a lot 😂)
19/11/2019, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Bee, when the going gets tough God is eternally faithful. Remind this to me the next time we talk :).
I thank God for you Debby. Everytime I think of us my trust in God grows
19/11/2019, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry for these messages you have to read in the morning 😅. Sometimes you only notice all the things that have passed when the pressure is relieved and that's what's happening to me today. 

Anywho I hope you have a fantabulous day 😊. I look forward to hearing all about it
19/11/2019, 22:54 - Bee: Nischal
19/11/2019, 23:27 - Bee: https://youtu.be/zugMUBeDtgE
19/11/2019, 23:27 - Bee: Video
20/11/2019, 02:35 - Bee: Yep. I'm going a little late with Reenee. Because I can't miss two days in a row. And the the medical camp will end by 4
20/11/2019, 02:35 - Bee: Yes. I was posted in the OT a few weeks ago
20/11/2019, 02:36 - Bee: This was me checking if you may be awake and if I can say hi. But I forgot to check if the message got delivered or not
20/11/2019, 02:37 - Bee: 😂 hahaha Nischal. That's a strong possibility
20/11/2019, 02:39 - Bee: I will. :)
I thank God for you too. Everyday. Most days several times a day. And I don't feel restless about this part of my life at all...and that for be is a big deal
20/11/2019, 02:39 - Bee: Me*
20/11/2019, 02:41 - Bee: Nooo don't be sorry!!!!
20/11/2019, 02:41 - Bee: I always look forward to hearing from you
20/11/2019, 02:42 - Bee: Praying for you
20/11/2019, 02:42 - Bee: Have a great day, Nischal.
20/11/2019, 02:42 - Bee: ☺
20/11/2019, 07:34 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. That's a cute video!
20/11/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea! Train travelling... I was just looking through the list of people going and started missing all of it :(
20/11/2019, 07:37 - Nischal Abraham: I probably was awake but I kept my phone aside by then
20/11/2019, 07:38 - Nischal Abraham: I know the feeling. It's a big deal for me too
20/11/2019, 07:39 - Nischal Abraham: And always remember that I do too. No matter how "busy" I may appear to be
20/11/2019, 07:40 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you've had a great day so far! Praying for the rest of it 😊
20/11/2019, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. Let me know how you're placed tonight. I'm not sure yet but if my lecture's done early I'll have an hour of walking to do which sounds like a great opportunity to talk if you ask me
20/11/2019, 11:14 - Bee: Hi Nischal!!
20/11/2019, 11:14 - Bee: It's been a good good day. 🥺 Everything worked out so well
20/11/2019, 11:15 - Bee: I AM FREEEEE
20/11/2019, 11:15 - Bee: Whenever you are. Let me know.
20/11/2019, 11:15 - Bee: Aww. You'll be missed too. By so many people
20/11/2019, 11:16 - Bee: :). I'll remember that.
20/11/2019, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God!
20/11/2019, 13:32 - Bee: Yes :)
20/11/2019, 13:32 - Bee: How's your day going?
20/11/2019, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been good so far. It's difficult getting range around here
20/11/2019, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just connected through my laptop to get network now... I think it's cause today is very cloudy
20/11/2019, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: I have a lecture now for maybe an hour or so... Probably after that I'll be free. Will message and check with you
20/11/2019, 14:05 - Bee: I'll be free
20/11/2019, 14:05 - Bee: Is there CU today?
20/11/2019, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: Today's the escape room thingy. But that's at 6
20/11/2019, 14:05 - Bee: OH!!!
20/11/2019, 14:05 - Bee: Are your excited?
20/11/2019, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: I was... Before I realised there's a possibility I may not be able to go. We'll see how things turn out
20/11/2019, 14:11 - Bee: Oh no! Why? Test? Lecture?
20/11/2019, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Well there's a test tomorrow
20/11/2019, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: And I have a submission. Its possible one of the submissions will get postponed but not sure yet
20/11/2019, 14:20 - Bee: When will you get to know for sure?

21/11/2019, 07:41 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like your work resumes again. You had a nice break for a while
21/11/2019, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: I reached home pretty late. And then one of the guys who stays further away from me didn't have a bus for another hour so I told him to come home and wait
21/11/2019, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: So by the time he got his bus and I returned home it was pretty late
21/11/2019, 07:43 - Nischal Abraham: Oh so much. So much to pray about this morning... Yesterday was a good day Debs. Loved the experience of the escape room! It was super fun
21/11/2019, 07:44 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo!! I'm sure it'll be a blessed experience for all of you. You'll have to lead the trek this year 😂

21/11/2019, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😁
21/11/2019, 08:59 - Bee: We took a looooooonnngg more dangerous path last year
21/11/2019, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: And now you know NOT to take that route
21/11/2019, 12:01 - Bee: 😂. I'll carry a torch with me
21/11/2019, 13:21 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a smart move

21/11/2019, 16:18 - Nischal Abraham: How do you use the phone while eating?
21/11/2019, 16:18 - Bee: Oh that's good to hear!!
21/11/2019, 16:18 - Bee: Eating with one hand using the phone with the other?
21/11/2019, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: Seems tedious. Especially in Ireland.
21/11/2019, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: With forks and spoons
21/11/2019, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
21/11/2019, 16:23 - Bee: I'll be free in 15

22/11/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: Incredible as always. Stephen got to join us too this week. Next week 2 of us are busy so we probably have to skip so not sure when exactly the next meet will be
22/11/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: I realise I need to find time to at least stretch through the day. It's difficult to go straight into a climb with a week of no exercise
22/11/2019, 10:02 - Bee: Because camp!!!!!
22/11/2019, 10:02 - Bee: I did!! But we lost. It was fun tho
22/11/2019, 10:05 - Bee: Weren't you exercising everyday?
22/11/2019, 10:05 - Bee: Stephen? I don't remember a Stephen
22/11/2019, 10:06 - Bee: Oh so two weeks later now
22/11/2019, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... It's nice that you had a good time :)
22/11/2019, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: I thought I would. But I didn't get any time at all this week
22/11/2019, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: Daniel's brother in law
22/11/2019, 11:03 - Bee: IM ON MY WAY HOME NISCHAL
22/11/2019, 11:03 - Bee: Now I remember a Stephen
22/11/2019, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: IT'S ALMOST TIME TO GO!! When do you leave with Reenee?
22/11/2019, 12:37 - Bee: 7
22/11/2019, 12:37 - Bee: Did I tell you that there's place in Ravi uncle's car?
22/11/2019, 12:37 - Bee: So Reenee, Daniel, and I are going with them
22/11/2019, 13:57 - Bee: We just left
22/11/2019, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: That's a lot of you. How do you all fit in?
22/11/2019, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Well always fun with more people :)
22/11/2019, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun Debby!! I know I won't be able to talk to you much these 3 days. I hope you hear what God has for you without my distracting hours of conversation 😁

22/11/2019, 14:10 - Bee: Thank you :)

22/11/2019, 14:11 - Bee: What are you doing?
22/11/2019, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm in the lab working on things till it's 3
22/11/2019, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: Going climbing again today since there's no lectures. Finished my submission for today just half an hour back
22/11/2019, 14:14 - Bee: Oh!
22/11/2019, 14:14 - Bee: Many people?
22/11/2019, 14:15 - Nischal Abraham: For the climbing? Maybe. I'll see when I get to the bus. In the lab? Nobody. It's a rainy day and I think everyone just stayed home
22/11/2019, 14:19 - Bee: Oh

22/11/2019, 14:27 - Bee: Cool. I'll take notes throughout. Of every moment.
22/11/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... You really mean all the details... That'll be a really long phone call 😂
22/11/2019, 14:28 - Bee: 😂
22/11/2019, 14:28 - Bee: I'll have no hours of sleep
22/11/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'd enjoy hearing whatever you have to say
22/11/2019, 14:30 - Bee: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
22/11/2019, 14:30 - Bee: Even gross medical stuff?
22/11/2019, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Especially that. It's such a big part of your life!
22/11/2019, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: How could I miss out on it

22/11/2019, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
22/11/2019, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: You're too kind. Are you being antisocial in the car Debby?
22/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: No I'm talking as well
22/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: We're looking for a place to it
22/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: The network may cut off anytime
22/11/2019, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I should head out for the bus stop as well
22/11/2019, 14:44 - Bee: I'll message you until it does. Or until you have to go. Whichever comes first.

24/11/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Did you lead the trek?

24/11/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Sophia?
24/11/2019, 18:08 - Bee: Anjali
24/11/2019, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Makes sense. She looked too tall 😂
24/11/2019, 18:08 - Bee: 😂
24/11/2019, 18:09 - Bee: And that hair isn't curly
24/11/2019, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yea :)
24/11/2019, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Where are you looking off to?
24/11/2019, 18:09 - Bee: We were looking for frogs
24/11/2019, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: That's lovely. Did you find any?
24/11/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Just one
24/11/2019, 18:13 - Bee: What are you doing?
24/11/2019, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Texting you. And deciding whether I want to have an early dinner or not. It's started to get dark by 4:30 now 😩
24/11/2019, 18:14 - Bee: That is EARLY. Are you hungry?
24/11/2019, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Had lunch at 3
24/11/2019, 18:17 - Bee: Oh
24/11/2019, 18:18 - Bee: I'm feeling sleepy
24/11/2019, 18:18 - Bee: I should go to sleep
24/11/2019, 18:18 - Bee: My rural postings begin tomorrow
24/11/2019, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Will be praying Debby. I'm so happy to hear from you. Glad you had a good time at the camp :)
24/11/2019, 18:19 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. :)
24/11/2019, 18:19 - Bee: Missed talking to you over the weekend.
24/11/2019, 18:20 - Bee: Hopefully we'll talk soon
24/11/2019, 18:20 - Bee: I don't know what time I'll return from the rural posting
24/11/2019, 18:20 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)))))
24/11/2019, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Don't stress. We'll talk when we can. Goodnight bee!
24/11/2019, 18:20 - Bee: Did you read the letter?
24/11/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: I did! :D
24/11/2019, 18:21 - Bee: Okay
24/11/2019, 18:21 - Bee: Goodnight :)
24/11/2019, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. Goodnight
25/11/2019, 04:10 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal ☺
25/11/2019, 04:10 - Bee: I'm on my way to the village where my postings will be. The drive there is so scenic
25/11/2019, 04:11 - Bee: What's your day like today m
25/11/2019, 04:11 - Bee: ?*
25/11/2019, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I hope your first day went well :)
25/11/2019, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not feeling too well so I'm staying home today. Hope to spend the time finishing up assignments due for the week
25/11/2019, 09:27 - Bee: It has been amazing so far. We went to a few factories today. Haven't gone to the village yet. I think we'll go to the village tomorrow onwards
25/11/2019, 09:28 - Bee: What hao?
25/11/2019, 09:28 - Bee: Happened*?
25/11/2019, 09:32 - Nischal Abraham: Why factories?
25/11/2019, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing much, just extra tired today is all
25/11/2019, 11:06 - Bee: All industrial visits. It's a requirement for this course. It was fun!!
25/11/2019, 11:06 - Bee: And they left us early. I'm waiting for the bus rn
25/11/2019, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. An early day after camp!
25/11/2019, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/9AThycGCakk
25/11/2019, 11:11 - Bee: Getting my earphones out
25/11/2019, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... You can watch it later :P. No urgency
25/11/2019, 11:11 - Bee: I shall watch it now.
25/11/2019, 11:12 - Bee: How many videos did you watch today?
25/11/2019, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: 😶🙁
25/11/2019, 11:16 - Bee: I'm sorry...I asked because you're at home today and if I was in your place I would've done everything but all the things I should be doing
25/11/2019, 11:16 - Bee: I'm sorry if you felt bad, Nischal
25/11/2019, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be sorry. You're right you know. I should really get to what I should be doing
25/11/2019, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: And in this situation I think it's good if I feel bad 😅
25/11/2019, 11:57 - Bee: You mentioned something like this before
25/11/2019, 11:58 - Bee: Yep. We can talk later
25/11/2019, 12:44 - Bee: I'm free until I go to sleep. Let me know if we can talk
25/11/2019, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: That's a lot of free time :O. Are you home already?
25/11/2019, 13:02 - Bee: Yesssss
25/11/2019, 13:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you don't mind talking while I'm cooking then we can talk now
25/11/2019, 13:09 - Bee: You won't burn food right?
25/11/2019, 18:12 - Bee: Did you get to talk to Ruth?
25/11/2019, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Done :)
25/11/2019, 18:25 - Bee: Yay!!
25/11/2019, 18:30 - Bee: 3 months!!!
25/11/2019, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Did you stay up just for that?
25/11/2019, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Feels a bit unreal
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Bee: I didn't
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Like I've been talking to you this closely for so much longer. And yet I can still remember how I felt that day
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Yes!!! That day!
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Thank you for not wishing me on my birthday
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: 😶
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Bee: Maybe things would've been different otherwise?
25/11/2019, 18:41 - Bee: No no no no honestly thank you
25/11/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you meant it that way
25/11/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Yes that way
25/11/2019, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for saying something about it
25/11/2019, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: I know for sure if you didn't I would've considered that to mean it was one sided for me
25/11/2019, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know how to say this in a way that doesn't make it sound bad... But I'm thankful I didn't wish you for that birthday too
25/11/2019, 18:44 - Bee: :). I'm thankful too.
25/11/2019, 18:44 - Bee: I never ever imagined we would be here today
25/11/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Me neither... I'm sorry I'm just at a loss for words right now 😅
25/11/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: This feels like one of those moments were I'd be silent on a call with you
25/11/2019, 18:46 - Bee: You're at a loss for words?! 😯
25/11/2019, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: But silence in messages don't convey the same thing
25/11/2019, 18:50 - Bee: You're special.
25/11/2019, 18:50 - Bee: I should go to sleep.
25/11/2019, 18:50 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
25/11/2019, 18:50 - Bee: :)
25/11/2019, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby... I really feel unworthy but I thank God for you. Everyday.
25/11/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have a good night. And an even better day :)
25/11/2019, 18:52 - Bee: Thank you. 🤗
25/11/2019, 18:52 - Bee: I hope you finish what you've planned for today.
25/11/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I hope so too. Okay now bye
25/11/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Bye!
26/11/2019, 10:10 - Bee: Hey :)
26/11/2019, 10:11 - Bee: I hope you're having a good day
26/11/2019, 10:11 - Bee: We conducted our survey today. I'm exhausted
26/11/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy! There was no lecture today so I had a lot of free time in the morning.
26/11/2019, 12:49 - Nischal Abraham: Did you have to walk around a lot?
26/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Yes. But the place is so green. It's a hilly area an the air is so fresh
26/11/2019, 13:19 - Bee: And there are so many butterflies of so many colors!
26/11/2019, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds pretty... Looks like you're in for a good month :)
26/11/2019, 15:30 - Bee: Yes. I'm excited!
26/11/2019, 15:30 - Bee: How's your day going?
26/11/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Day is finally done
26/11/2019, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Feels like such a lazy day today
26/11/2019, 17:12 - Bee: Back home?
26/11/2019, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Na still in college. Planning on heading back latef
26/11/2019, 17:27 - Bee: Oh
26/11/2019, 17:27 - Bee: I'll go to bed
26/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: Kinda tired
26/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: Waking up early to complete an assignment
26/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: Goodnight!
26/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: :)
26/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: CU tomorrow?
26/11/2019, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good. I should be working on my assignment too
26/11/2019, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
26/11/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Okay
26/11/2019, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby!
26/11/2019, 17:29 - Bee: Goodnight :)
27/11/2019, 03:44 - Bee: Heeeyyyyyy.
27/11/2019, 03:44 - Bee: What's the topic for CU today?
27/11/2019, 03:45 - Bee: What would I be surprised to learn about you?
27/11/2019, 03:45 - Bee: Have a blessed day, Nischal.
27/11/2019, 03:45 - Bee: ☺
27/11/2019, 07:50 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!!
27/11/2019, 07:51 - Nischal Abraham: Today's talk is on outreach. Specifically for Christmas and the plan they have. I'll find out the details today I guess
27/11/2019, 07:51 - Nischal Abraham: Is it surprising? Well I'm glad you get to learn something from all the talking I do 😂
27/11/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: You too Debby! Enjoy beautiful places and meeting new people 😊
27/11/2019, 09:56 - Bee: Is what surprising?
27/11/2019, 09:57 - Bee: My Marathi has improved so much!! I didn't realize it until today
27/11/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Learning about me
27/11/2019, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: A lot of Marathi speaking where you are?
27/11/2019, 11:30 - Bee: Yes?
27/11/2019, 11:31 - Bee: Yes!! Not even Hindi. Not a word of Hindi.
27/11/2019, 11:43 - Bee: Something about you that I'll be surprised to know/find out
27/11/2019, 11:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/11/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: It is cheesy. Good thing I like cheese 😊
27/11/2019, 12:49 - Nischal Abraham: If you find something let me know too. I think you've seen everything there is to see
27/11/2019, 13:25 - Bee: I found it surprising that you keep a diary.
27/11/2019, 13:27 - Bee: And that you fold your clothes neatly. (I don't know why this was surprising. Pls don't ask :P)
27/11/2019, 14:42 - Bee: I'm craving sweet Nischal
27/11/2019, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: I think it's fine to occasionally eat them Debby. I mean if you're in a social situation where it would be terribly extremely rude not to then you probably should right?
27/11/2019, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: How are you feeling physically though? Still headaches?
27/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: I should
27/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: No headaches now
27/11/2019, 17:28 - Bee: CU?
27/11/2019, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Busy completing assignment in lab 😞
27/11/2019, 17:35 - Bee: Oh. You have time right
27/11/2019, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sort of... Lots of other things to do as well
27/11/2019, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry I've been unable to reply properly today Debby :(
27/11/2019, 18:18 - Bee: It's okay Nischal. Don't worry about it.. we have a looooott of time to talk. :)
27/11/2019, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Shouldn't you bee sleeping?
27/11/2019, 18:39 - Bee: Going to bed now
27/11/2019, 18:40 - Bee: I slept for an hour in the evening. There was a lot of walking today
27/11/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Bye Nischal :)
27/11/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Praying for you.
27/11/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! Thank you
27/11/2019, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you too :)
27/11/2019, 22:07 - Nischal Abraham: Random youtube video for the day https://youtu.be/d-yWx772qFU
27/11/2019, 22:08 - Nischal Abraham: You probably know this stuff already. It was interesting for me to watch though
28/11/2019, 03:42 - Bee: She's so neat!!
28/11/2019, 03:43 - Bee: I don't know this technique. I know the one which requires instrument throughout
28/11/2019, 03:43 - Bee: Goo morning, Nischal. :)
28/11/2019, 03:51 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Extraordinary Magic by Ben Rector
https://open.spotify.com/track/6twjbQiAbWOMUt4S8RoDbk?si=IjLhglSWQLaB2FXmU8wsUQ
28/11/2019, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby
28/11/2019, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Something new for you too then!
28/11/2019, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: Oh sorry... I mean good afternoon! 😂
28/11/2019, 10:06 - Bee: 😂
28/11/2019, 10:07 - Bee: How was CU?
28/11/2019, 12:46 - Bee: Hey :)
Praying for you and about your test and presentation tomorrow. Turning off WhatsApp for the rest of the night.
 Bye. :)
28/11/2019, 23:24 - Nischal Abraham: It was a small crowd this week. But it was nice. Had a nice small Bible study on the Samaritan woman at the well
28/11/2019, 23:25 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby! Can you believe it took till now for me to get free enough to message 😅. I sort of finished the presentation but I guess I'll never be truly done with it till its over
28/11/2019, 23:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying you have a good day tomorrow! It must be tiring to be travelling every day but I'm sure God will lead you to many opportunities to count it all joy 😊
28/11/2019, 23:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be traveling for the CU camp tomorrow. I'll try and message you sometime after the test but it's a pretty tight schedule
28/11/2019, 23:29 - Nischal Abraham: 0900-1100.  Presentations
1340-1540.  Test
1400-1600.   Residence permit collection
1700.     Bus leaves for Athlone from Maynooth
28/11/2019, 23:30 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't get time to do anything regarding the project. Got some *strong* motivation from my guide 😂 today
28/11/2019, 23:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I think that's everything on my end. Good morning for when you see this 😁
28/11/2019, 23:35 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. 🤗
29/11/2019, 01:56 - Bee: Busiest day ever or what?!
29/11/2019, 01:57 - Bee: Thank you. :) Yes there's a lot of walking but some days we're left early and on those days I reach home by 5:30
29/11/2019, 01:57 - Bee: I'm excited for you!!! Make the most of the camp. Are you traveling straight from college?
29/11/2019, 01:59 - Bee: Your day is packed!!
29/11/2019, 02:01 - Bee: Praying for you. I hope your test and presentation goes well.
29/11/2019, 02:02 - Bee: ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠ don't worry about replying to these messages
29/11/2019, 06:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. The bus leaves from Maynooth so it's easier to go from there... I was a little discouraged when I initially heard that only 3 other people from Maynooth are going...
29/11/2019, 06:44 - Nischal Abraham: But then I realise that just means greater opportunity to meet more new people and not be comfortable with the ones I already know! So yes, I'm excited too 😊
29/11/2019, 06:44 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's nice. Is your project work happening side by side then?
29/11/2019, 06:45 - Nischal Abraham: It feels like it's been the busiest week!! But it ends on a weekend to put my mind away from things so maybe it'll be good 😁
29/11/2019, 06:46 - Nischal Abraham: But I enjoy replying to your messages. And mornings may be the only free time I've got
29/11/2019, 07:08 - Bee: That's on hold for now. I have college tomorrow. So we'll work on that
29/11/2019, 07:09 - Bee: Wow. That's nice. My anxiety would've kicked in if I was in your place
29/11/2019, 07:10 - Bee: A butterfly flew and sat on my finger today!!! 😭 It felt like a Disney movie. I was looking around for singing monkeys and deer
29/11/2019, 07:13 - Nischal Abraham: You have to start the singing Debby... Then the birds and deer follow
29/11/2019, 07:17 - Nischal Abraham: I have bigger more important things to be anxious about than my leisure time 😅
29/11/2019, 07:32 - Bee: 😂 that's when they'll run away Nischal
29/11/2019, 08:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/11/2019, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... It stayed on long enough for you to take a picture?
29/11/2019, 16:35 - Bee: I stayed VERY still.
29/11/2019, 16:37 - Bee: I went for a movie and dinner with a friend from college. Tired and back home now. It was a good day :). There's college tomorrow so I can sleep in for an extra hour 😌
29/11/2019, 16:38 - Bee: I pray that you have a wonderful time at the camp. And that you learn new things and come back refreshed.
29/11/2019, 16:38 - Bee: I hope and trust that your presentation and test went well.
29/11/2019, 16:38 - Bee: Take in every moment!!
29/11/2019, 16:43 - Bee: Let me know how it went
29/11/2019, 16:43 - Bee: Whenever
29/11/2019, 16:44 - Bee: Bye, Nischal! :))))))))))
29/11/2019, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Both went really well! Everything was such a rush today. I'm in the bus to the camp now. So this'll be the last message for a while. Have a great weekend you! I'll be praying for you too 😊
30/11/2019, 13:23 - Bee: Thank you. 😊
01/12/2019, 09:32 - Bee: I ate a waffle today
01/12/2019, 20:18 - Nischal Abraham: Hi!!!!!
01/12/2019, 20:18 - Nischal Abraham: I know you're sleeping. And I won't be flooding you with messages about all the details
01/12/2019, 20:19 - Nischal Abraham: The camp was so much more than I thought it could be. I think you prayed too hard cause God was just flooding me with answers for things I didn't even know I'm struggling with
01/12/2019, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: I met amazing new people. Had wonderful conversations and discussions... It's so so much more than I could have imagined
01/12/2019, 22:09 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
02/12/2019, 00:35 - Bee: HEY!!!!
02/12/2019, 00:36 - Bee: Whyyyy
02/12/2019, 04:09 - Bee: Hi again!!!
02/12/2019, 04:09 - Bee: ??
02/12/2019, 04:10 - Bee: I'm so happy for you. :)
02/12/2019, 04:10 - Bee: Can't wait to hear all about it!
02/12/2019, 04:10 - Bee: I missed you so much!!
02/12/2019, 09:11 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up eating cakes and marshmellows at the camp too. I tried to avoid it the first day... But there were just so many options!
02/12/2019, 09:12 - Nischal Abraham: Because it's things I want to talk to you about :). It wasn't the sequence of events that happened that mattered but the content and learning in them
02/12/2019, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: I told you I'd send a photo of how my clothes are organized. Although the photo doesn't really show it very well. Perhaps a video call when possible
02/12/2019, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: I missed you too Debby! I hope you're having a wonderful day 😊
02/12/2019, 11:07 - Bee: Ofc. You can't miss out on cakes and marshmallows 😋
02/12/2019, 11:09 - Bee: Oh. You're saying it's tidier than it looks? 😯
02/12/2019, 11:13 - Bee: Did I tell you that I missed you? Because I did. So much.
02/12/2019, 11:13 - Bee: I hope you have a good day!
02/12/2019, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be having my Bible study with the guys today this week as no one is free on Thursday
02/12/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: Any chance you'll be free for a call? It's okay if you aren't. Don't force free time
02/12/2019, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: Cause I should call my parents too so I'll probably do that. My lecture is done for the day. Just free lab session for the evening. So I'm free for anytime from now till 7pm Irish time
02/12/2019, 13:02 - Bee: I'm free until dinner time. Let me know when you finish your call with your parents
02/12/2019, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. I'm done talking to my parents. What time is your dinner?
02/12/2019, 15:05 - Bee: I'm having dinner rn. I'll be done in 15
02/12/2019, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: My timing is always bad :P. Let me know when you're free. I should(hopefully) be free too
02/12/2019, 15:36 - Bee: I know I took more than 15 minutes
02/12/2019, 15:36 - Bee: I'm free now. Let me know if you are
02/12/2019, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep me too
02/12/2019, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: You sure you don't have any assignments and such
02/12/2019, 15:46 - Bee: I'm sure
02/12/2019, 15:47 - Bee: You?
02/12/2019, 15:47 - Bee: I'll call?
03/12/2019, 05:51 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :)
03/12/2019, 05:52 - Bee: I hope the Bible study was enriching
03/12/2019, 05:52 - Bee: Have a wonderful day.
03/12/2019, 05:52 - Bee: ☺
03/12/2019, 08:29 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! The Bible study was wonderful :)
03/12/2019, 08:29 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby! I hope you have a great day too!!

03/12/2019, 12:55 - Bee: It*
03/12/2019, 12:55 - Bee: 😂😂😂
03/12/2019, 12:55 - Bee: WOW so many pretty colors
03/12/2019, 12:56 - Bee: What are these even?!?!?!
03/12/2019, 12:56 - Bee: Is this Blake?
03/12/2019, 12:56 - Bee: Hahaha the guy in the tank 😂
03/12/2019, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: Guy with the long blonde hair is Blake
03/12/2019, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: It is!!!
03/12/2019, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: It's a tree. I've never seen anything like it before
03/12/2019, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: That's Charlie
03/12/2019, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yea 😂😂
04/12/2019, 00:50 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal
04/12/2019, 00:50 - Bee: I'm sorry for such a late reply...I was exhausted yesterday and went to sleep very early
04/12/2019, 07:29 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be sorry! Good afternoon Debby :)
04/12/2019, 07:29 - Nischal Abraham: I've been really busy too. And I'll continue being really busy for the rest of the week... And probably the week after as well
04/12/2019, 07:30 - Nischal Abraham: Time is flying so fast and there's so many submissions to be done 😶
04/12/2019, 10:32 - Bee: How many this week?
04/12/2019, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: 1 today, 1 on Friday, and a test on Thursday
04/12/2019, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going?
04/12/2019, 12:19 - Bee: Today was good :) visited the family thats been assigned to me, played cricket with the kids, sat by the river, and explored the village some more
04/12/2019, 12:19 - Bee: It feels like everyday is a picnic
04/12/2019, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! I had Biryani today for lunch and now I'm falling asleep 😂
04/12/2019, 15:01 - Bee: 😂
04/12/2019, 15:01 - Bee: You made biryani?!
04/12/2019, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. There's a Pakistani/Indian food place near here that we all went to during lunch
04/12/2019, 17:18 - Bee: Oh
04/12/2019, 17:18 - Bee: How was it compared to Rashids?
04/12/2019, 17:18 - Bee: Reenee has come over
04/12/2019, 17:19 - Bee: For Sunday school anniversary work
04/12/2019, 17:19 - Bee: How's your day going?
04/12/2019, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Probably better... It was like proper restaurant quality Biryani with the cashews and all. Costs a lot more though so that's negative points for this one :P
04/12/2019, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: All the best for that! I'll be praying it goes well.... was it this Sunday? I'm losing track of time 😂
04/12/2019, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Very very very busy. I'm sorry if I don't get time to reply to you :(
04/12/2019, 17:26 - Bee: Biryani with cashews is fancy
04/12/2019, 17:26 - Bee: Yes this Sunday. The 8th
04/12/2019, 17:33 - Bee: Don't worry about it, Nischal
04/12/2019, 17:33 - Bee: :)
04/12/2019, 18:39 - Bee: Bye, Nischal!
04/12/2019, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby :)
05/12/2019, 01:36 - Bee: Nischal
05/12/2019, 01:36 - Bee: It's raining 😶
05/12/2019, 01:36 - Bee: Not heavily. More of a drizzle.
05/12/2019, 01:37 - Bee: Anyway there's water falling from the sky
05/12/2019, 01:37 - Bee: On the 5th of December 😶
05/12/2019, 01:52 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal.
05/12/2019, 01:53 - Bee: You are precious and loved and fearfully and wonderfully made. You are loved more than you will ever know by Someone who died to know you.
05/12/2019, 01:53 - Bee: Praying for you as you prepare and write your test.
05/12/2019, 01:53 - Bee: Have a blessed day, Nischal.
05/12/2019, 01:53 - Bee: ☺
05/12/2019, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: I like this description
05/12/2019, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby!
05/12/2019, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for your prayers. For some reason I always remember "undeserved, unrestrained" whenever I think of all the people who care for me
05/12/2019, 10:09 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know if it'll be possible(on my end mostly) but could we talk today? Even if its just for 10 minutes...
05/12/2019, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: But if you have things to do that's alright. Don't worry about it :). I hope you had/have a wonderful picnic day too ☺
05/12/2019, 10:38 - Bee: I'd love that. There's song practice after the Bible study. I think I'll be back home latest by 10...let me know whenever you can squeeze a call in
05/12/2019, 10:39 - Nischal Abraham: What time do you normally go to bed?
05/12/2019, 10:39 - Bee: I did!! There was some more exploring.
05/12/2019, 10:40 - Bee: Usually by 11. But I have college tomorrow. No postings. I'll be up
05/12/2019, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds exciting!
05/12/2019, 10:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'll message by 10 and see. Thanks for being accomodating Debby 😊
05/12/2019, 10:51 - Bee: Why are you being so formal
05/12/2019, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: Don't overthink it 😶
05/12/2019, 12:42 - Bee: Okay
05/12/2019, 12:42 - Bee: I won't
05/12/2019, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: The test went very well. Praise God! 😁
05/12/2019, 12:48 - Bee: Praise God! Lecture now?
05/12/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'll have a lecture in an hour that'll probably go on till 2:30
05/12/2019, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: So just some free time till then
05/12/2019, 12:51 - Bee: Oh
05/12/2019, 12:51 - Bee: I'm trying to finish an assignment because I won't feel like doing it after the Bible study and song practice
05/12/2019, 12:52 - Bee: :(
05/12/2019, 12:53 - Bee: Sorry I'm assuming this would've been a good time to talk
05/12/2019, 12:53 - Bee: What time will you be back home today?
05/12/2019, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: No no that's okay. I'm working on my assignments as well
05/12/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Not sure... I'm thinking if possible I'd like to go climbing today since I have to meet my supervisor tomorrow
05/12/2019, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Makes sense... I'd feel the same :P
05/12/2019, 13:05 - Bee: Okay. I'll be up
05/12/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: If you want to sleep then don't stay up just for me :o. I'll feel terrible
05/12/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Don't worry about me. I'll let you know when I'm sleepy
05/12/2019, 13:19 - Bee: Have you eaten lunch?
05/12/2019, 13:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Lecture starting now
05/12/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Okay
05/12/2019, 13:45 - Bee: Leaving for the Bible study. Bye! :)
05/12/2019, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
05/12/2019, 16:31 - Bee: Hey
05/12/2019, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: So didn't go rock climbing. I'm home now
05/12/2019, 16:33 - Bee: Just reached home
05/12/2019, 16:33 - Bee: Wru?
05/12/2019, 16:33 - Bee: Oh no.. why?
05/12/2019, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: No one else was going today. I think it's for the best really
05/12/2019, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Gonna have dinner now?
05/12/2019, 16:35 - Bee: Oh. Tired?
05/12/2019, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright... How about you?
05/12/2019, 16:36 - Bee: Yes.. give me 20 minutes? Will you be free then?
05/12/2019, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yes I will
05/12/2019, 16:36 - Bee: I'm okay
05/12/2019, 16:36 - Bee: Okay. In 20

06/12/2019, 06:50 - Bee: Wait, is it sunny?
06/12/2019, 08:48 - Nischal Abraham: It isn't raining for now. Predicted rainfall at night... Very cloudy and gloomy these last 2 days
06/12/2019, 08:49 - Nischal Abraham: Marshmallow?
06/12/2019, 08:50 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! 🌧🌧
06/12/2019, 11:15 - Bee: Ask me again in 5 years. If you remember
06/12/2019, 11:15 - Bee: Otherwise I'll remind you to ask me. :P
06/12/2019, 11:15 - Bee: Nooo so it'll be cold
06/12/2019, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: It is cold. And its raining now... and windy
06/12/2019, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: Finally I  have an answer for what I want to do in 5 years
06/12/2019, 11:19 - Bee: 😂
06/12/2019, 11:19 - Bee: What's up?
06/12/2019, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: Working on my project at home. I have to meet my supervisor at 4... So I thought I'll just eat lunch at home and then go
06/12/2019, 11:38 - Nischal Abraham: How was college
06/12/2019, 11:39 - Nischal Abraham: Or "is" college... Are you done yet?
06/12/2019, 11:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/12/2019, 11:41 - Bee: Yes. I'm on my way back. College was alright. There was a lot of free time because the teachers had some meeting
06/12/2019, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! I wonder what the longest is now? 😂
06/12/2019, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: That's good... Restful day today then. How many assignments do you have for today?
06/12/2019, 11:57 - Bee: 😂
06/12/2019, 11:57 - Bee: 4 hours?
06/12/2019, 11:57 - Bee: No that was a call
06/12/2019, 11:58 - Bee: None!!!!!!! Which is good. Because the Neev dinner is tonight
06/12/2019, 12:03 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes!! Excited?
06/12/2019, 12:04 - Bee: I am!!!

06/12/2019, 12:05 - Bee: Mostly because of AAA.
06/12/2019, 12:05 - Bee: Anurag, Anjali, and Ashish
06/12/2019, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Nice 😂. I was wondering why you're so excited about betteries
06/12/2019, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: batteries*
06/12/2019, 12:10 - Bee: 😂😂
06/12/2019, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Well if I was referring to message conversations then I'm pretty sure the record's been broken this year. I ended up scrolling all the way up to our first message
06/12/2019, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Not as uneventful as I thought it would be :P
06/12/2019, 12:11 - Bee: Hahahahaha
06/12/2019, 12:11 - Bee: I started with just the starred messages but then I read everything
06/12/2019, 12:13 - Bee: April 24 2018? That's the oldest one I have
06/12/2019, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: 1 May 2016
06/12/2019, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: It's a photo of a photo taken when Ashriel was leaving
06/12/2019, 12:16 - Bee: 😶
06/12/2019, 12:20 - Bee: Are you going to buy a new phone before you visit India
06/12/2019, 12:21 - Nischal Abraham: Probably not... There's other stuff I need to waste my money on before a new ohone
06/12/2019, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: What time is your dinner?
06/12/2019, 12:38 - Bee: Oh good then I can read the chats that I don't have
06/12/2019, 12:38 - Bee: It's at 6:45
06/12/2019, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: That's early!
06/12/2019, 13:19 - Bee: There's some time for sharing testimonies before dinner
06/12/2019, 13:21 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun Debby! I hope you have a blessed time!!
06/12/2019, 13:24 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. :) I'm sure I will.
06/12/2019, 15:58 - Bee: Neev dinner went well! God has blessed this ministry so much
06/12/2019, 15:58 - Bee: And I learnt that every little achievement should be celebrated
06/12/2019, 18:03 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/12/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Nischal!!! How's your day been?
06/12/2019, 18:04 - Bee: Tell me. Even though I'll read your messages in the morning.
06/12/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
06/12/2019, 18:05 - Bee: Send yours
06/12/2019, 18:06 - Bee: If you don't mind.
06/12/2019, 18:15 - Bee: Bye!
06/12/2019, 23:18 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a wonderful lesson to learn!
06/12/2019, 23:18 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
06/12/2019, 23:19 - Nischal Abraham: My day was a lot of ups and downs. Indecisions in decisions I need to make... Hopefully tomorrow presents itself with more clarity :)
06/12/2019, 23:19 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you read this Bee 😊
06/12/2019, 23:20 - Nischal Abraham: I say that but it was mostly ups. I think any day where I get to sleep with a smile on my face should be considered a good day! And I should apply your new lesson in this case :P
07/12/2019, 01:40 - Bee: Good morning :)
07/12/2019, 01:41 - Bee: Decisions about your project?
07/12/2019, 01:41 - Bee: You slept with a smile on your face? That makes me go aww.
07/12/2019, 09:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And other assignments
07/12/2019, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! Hope you have a great day ahead. I slept way too long so I better not be tired for the rest of the day
07/12/2019, 11:25 - Bee: I had a quiet day. I was posted at a health centre near the village that we go to... Very few people came in
07/12/2019, 15:08 - Bee: How's your day going?
07/12/2019, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't been overly productive today... I just feel like lying in bed forever
07/12/2019, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: And its been really stormy outdoors today
07/12/2019, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: Like no rains... Just very cloudy and windy
07/12/2019, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: Are you ready for tomorrow?
07/12/2019, 15:44 - Bee: I think I am. I'll find out tomorrow
07/12/2019, 15:44 - Bee: I'm worried about the kids not turning up
07/12/2019, 15:45 - Bee: I gave the parents (and kids) a reminder call today but a few numbers weren't reachable
07/12/2019, 15:45 - Bee: Please pray that all of them come.
07/12/2019, 15:45 - Bee: Nischal why??!!!
07/12/2019, 15:45 - Bee: Do you want a pep talk?
07/12/2019, 15:45 - Bee: Or a meme?
07/12/2019, 15:45 - Bee: Or a riddle?
07/12/2019, 15:50 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/12/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely
07/12/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Idk why. Just is... I'm reaching that stage of there's too much to do and I've taken on too much and I won't be able to finish anything on time so I just won't do anything
07/12/2019, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Is this a riddle?
07/12/2019, 15:59 - Bee: Is it?
07/12/2019, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know. You asked if I wanted a riddle and shared the photo. That's puzzling to me 😂
07/12/2019, 16:01 - Bee: No ya. I was looking back at the Delhi trip photos
07/12/2019, 16:01 - Bee: And found that
07/12/2019, 16:02 - Bee: What are the dates for the submissions?
07/12/2019, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: There's one for Monday. 2 for Wednesday. 1 for Thursday. And I'm not around for tomorrow and day after
07/12/2019, 16:47 - Bee: 😶
07/12/2019, 16:48 - Bee: Where are you going tomorrow and day after?
07/12/2019, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Cherian is getting his citizenship for Ireland. So he'll be making a trip out of it with his family. He invited me along as well and I didn't have a reason to say no then
07/12/2019, 16:50 - Bee: Oh wow! They must be elated
07/12/2019, 16:51 - Bee: You must be busy with your assignments. Praying that you find the motivation to finish
07/12/2019, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: They are! And I get time to spend with the kids 😊
07/12/2019, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: If only my assignments weren't around to worry me 😞
07/12/2019, 16:51 - Bee: Play I spy!
07/12/2019, 16:52 - Bee: You can do it!! You have so many hours left
07/12/2019, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I'm sorry you have your Sunday school tomorrow and I'm just conversing about my assignments
07/12/2019, 16:54 - Bee: No Nischal it's okay.
07/12/2019, 16:54 - Bee: I'm fine
07/12/2019, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad to hear it. If I'm being honest the biggest thing I'm worrying about it tomorrow
07/12/2019, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Is*
07/12/2019, 16:55 - Bee: The message?
07/12/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yea...
07/12/2019, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: When I talk to Paddy and Daniel and hear how much time and commitment they put into their spiritual lives...
07/12/2019, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: It just feels like I waste so much of my day on unimportant things. Even if I'm not doing them, just thinking about them
07/12/2019, 17:07 - Bee: Sorry I was on a call
07/12/2019, 17:09 - Bee: It's always a struggle... We need to spend every minute intentionally... Otherwise time flies and we're stuck in the same place
07/12/2019, 17:10 - Bee: There were a few people I looked up to when I was in my teens and they were in their twenties... And now I'm in my twenties but I haven't grown much as a Christian like they did
07/12/2019, 17:10 - Bee: But it's never too late to start
07/12/2019, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: I know right! I fear that I'll just end up being the same person that I used to be and not grow at all
07/12/2019, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: I know this... And yet sometimes I feel the complete opposite
07/12/2019, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: The only thing to do is to actually get to it. I'm praying for your tomorrow Debby. This one and the next ones to come!

I'll go take a shower, clear my head and put technology aside. I need to spend time with God. I know you're praying for me too and I want you to know that's always an encouragement for me to keep "pressing on" as Paul puts it 😊
07/12/2019, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I pray you have a blessed day tomorrow
07/12/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal.
07/12/2019, 17:21 - Bee: ☺
07/12/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
07/12/2019, 17:23 - Bee: I'm a bit worried about tomorrow. Just praying that everything that happens will be for God's glory and not mine. Bye!
07/12/2019, 23:21 - Nischal Abraham: My prayer is the same :)
08/12/2019, 06:09 - Bee: NISCHAL
08/12/2019, 06:09 - Bee: ALL MY KIDS HAVE COME 😭
08/12/2019, 07:25 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God!! 🙌🏻
08/12/2019, 07:25 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know how it goes. Even if I'll only read it much later
08/12/2019, 09:46 - Bee: Hey :) 
My kids did it well!! They were so excited
08/12/2019, 09:46 - Bee: And the youth.... WOW!!
08/12/2019, 09:47 - Bee: I felt God's presence throughout. It wouldn't have gone the way it did if not for Him
08/12/2019, 09:47 - Bee: Praying for you.
08/12/2019, 15:54 - Bee: I am singing alto! 😂
08/12/2019, 15:54 - Bee: It's was a good day.
08/12/2019, 15:55 - Bee: I have a health talk tomorrow. I need to prepare for that tonight
08/12/2019, 15:55 - Bee: It*
08/12/2019, 15:56 - Bee: How's your day going?
08/12/2019, 15:56 - Bee: Are you staying over someplace?
08/12/2019, 15:56 - Bee: Have fun!
08/12/2019, 15:56 - Bee: You must be having fun. I don't have to say it
08/12/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Goodnight, dearest Nischal.
08/12/2019, 17:20 - Bee: ☺
08/12/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!!!
08/12/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome news!!!!
08/12/2019, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: 😭
08/12/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: So glad to hear it went well. Praying for your talk tomorrow. I'm still travelling in the car
08/12/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: I told you I'd be travelling with Cherian right? Well I'll be away for today and tomorrow. Sorry I couldn't message back :(
08/12/2019, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee :)
08/12/2019, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Killarney is the name of the place. You can Google the distance between Dublin and that to see how far I'm traveling
09/12/2019, 04:11 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
09/12/2019, 04:11 - Bee: Thank you so much.
09/12/2019, 04:12 - Bee: Yes you did. Don't be sorry... Be in the moment!
09/12/2019, 04:12 - Bee: Google Earth shows me that this place is beautiful
09/12/2019, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: So I've heard too. There's a place where they seem to have filmed lord of the rings here. And another where they filmed star wars
09/12/2019, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: Anyway we'll be sightseeing today. And I'll be babysitting today. Pray for me 😂
09/12/2019, 10:15 - Bee: Babysitting is the best!!! I'll be praying for you :P
09/12/2019, 11:23 - Bee: My health talk didn't happen today. The family that I am assigned wasn't available. So it's tomorrow
09/12/2019, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay... We're on our way out of the apartment we were staying in.
09/12/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. I tried to get through without TV time but I eventually ran out of energy to keep them distracted
09/12/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: So the ending was TV time. It's a really beautiful day today. Nice and sunny
09/12/2019, 14:53 - Bee: Heading back home?
09/12/2019, 14:54 - Bee: Oh...I resort to TV too. Nobody can match their energy
09/12/2019, 22:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm back home! So much happened. I'm so exhausted 😂. It was a 4.5 hour drive one way
10/12/2019, 05:09 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
10/12/2019, 05:09 - Bee: What happened?!
10/12/2019, 05:09 - Bee: Did you play I spy?
10/12/2019, 05:10 - Bee: I'm guessing you needed a lot more to keep them occupied throughout the 4.5 (+4.5) hour drive
10/12/2019, 05:12 - Bee: I found my mother's skirt from when she was 25. She kept it for the sentiment. And it fits me!! I wish she had a photo of herself in that skirt. Then I would've recreated it.
10/12/2019, 05:55 - Bee: Finished my health talk. It went alright. Thank you for praying :)
10/12/2019, 07:49 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
10/12/2019, 07:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'll tell it to you when we talk next
10/12/2019, 07:50 - Nischal Abraham: Tried to. But they got bored of that very quickly. There was a lot of sleeping involved
10/12/2019, 07:50 - Nischal Abraham: They're good kids... They entertain themselves most of the time 😂. Except when they get cranky but that's for the parents to deal with
10/12/2019, 07:51 - Nischal Abraham: Wow! Sounds like it would've made a really cool photo. Maybe you could do it for the next generation
10/12/2019, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so glad it did!! Praising God
10/12/2019, 07:53 - Nischal Abraham: I've got submissions lined up for these 2 weeks... Need to get back into assignment completion mode now
10/12/2019, 11:18 - Bee: Good idea. I shall do that.
10/12/2019, 11:20 - Bee: And then holidays!!
10/12/2019, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Hopefully the skirt lasts that long 😂. 
How's your day going?
10/12/2019, 14:35 - Bee: Hahaha. What if there's no daughter?!
10/12/2019, 14:35 - Bee: I keep it for Ashley's daughter
10/12/2019, 14:35 - Bee: Wait
10/12/2019, 14:35 - Bee: What if he doesn't have one either?!
10/12/2019, 14:36 - Bee: My day is going alright
10/12/2019, 14:36 - Bee: I'm done for today.
10/12/2019, 14:36 - Bee: I have nothing to do. I don't know if I missing something
10/12/2019, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: That's early 😮. In a sense even I'm technically done for the day
10/12/2019, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: But I've got a terribly big submission for tomorrow
10/12/2019, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: You're overthinking this 😂😂
10/12/2019, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Any chance for us to talk today?
10/12/2019, 16:40 - Bee: Yes yes yes and yes
10/12/2019, 16:41 - Bee: Finished this assignment?
10/12/2019, 16:41 - Bee: What are you going to do for the rest of the day then?
10/12/2019, 16:42 - Bee: It's a real fear
10/12/2019, 16:48 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
10/12/2019, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Now?
10/12/2019, 16:51 - Bee: I'm having dinner. In 10?
10/12/2019, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Send me a text when
10/12/2019, 17:05 - Bee: Nischal
10/12/2019, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yes
10/12/2019, 17:05 - Bee: I finished dinner
10/12/2019, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Call?
10/12/2019, 17:58 - Bee: I cut you off
10/12/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Sorry
10/12/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Bye!!!
10/12/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Go do your assignment!!
10/12/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: You don't need to be sorry for that Debby :)
10/12/2019, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Byee! Goodnight!
10/12/2019, 18:02 - Bee: Goodnight. ☺
11/12/2019, 06:38 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!

11/12/2019, 06:38 - Bee: Assignment*
11/12/2019, 07:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Haven't finished it. But I made good progress... Hopefully I'll be able to get it done by the end of the day
11/12/2019, 11:30 - Bee: Do you have a lecture?
11/12/2019, 13:49 - Bee: Pune tomorrow!!!!! 🤩
11/12/2019, 14:45 - Bee: Thank you for the memories. Looking forward to making a lot more ☺. Just wanted to tell you this. I'm not expecting any reply.
11/12/2019, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. He gave the day to complete the project. It looks like I'll finish on time 😮
11/12/2019, 18:26 - Bee: How's it going?
11/12/2019, 18:41 - Bee: I had to pack. And as usual I took a long time
11/12/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Going to bed now.
11/12/2019, 18:41 - Bee: Praying that you're able to complete your project
11/12/2019, 18:41 - Bee: I miss you.
11/12/2019, 18:42 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
11/12/2019, 21:07 - Nischal Abraham: I completed it just in time!! Praise God
11/12/2019, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: Well I say completed. But I did do the bare minimum. I'm happy that I submitted though 😁. Now I have tomorrow's project meeting with my guide ...
11/12/2019, 21:09 - Nischal Abraham: The weather has gotten to biting cold levels now. My nose freezes in 10 min of me being outdoors
11/12/2019, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: You must be so excited!! Have fun Debby :). I wanna hear all the excruciating details
11/12/2019, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too. So so much somedays
11/12/2019, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you see this! Once I'm home I'll message about the CU stuff that got updated today
12/12/2019, 03:39 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
12/12/2019, 03:40 - Bee: Oh noooo. 
Apparently it's cold in Pune rn. And I'm taking a sweatshirt. And by cold I mean 17 degrees 😂
12/12/2019, 03:40 - Bee: I AM!!!! We're having a Christmassy pyjama party. :P
12/12/2019, 03:41 - Bee: You aren't home yet?! :O
JK. You must be tired.
12/12/2019, 03:41 - Bee: We're organizing a program for the school kids here in the village today. Puppet shows, physical examinations and stuff.
12/12/2019, 03:41 - Bee: Have a great day ☺
12/12/2019, 03:42 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/12/2019, 08:20 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
12/12/2019, 08:21 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon. I hope your street play went well yesterday!
12/12/2019, 08:21 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds fun! You really are having a picnic most of these days.
12/12/2019, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: 17 is cold temperature. Don't let my weather fool you... Ireland isn't cold, it's freezing
12/12/2019, 08:23 - Nischal Abraham: I was... I'll update you on stuff when I can 😅. Well by the time we have our next call I'll have a lot more to tell you of things that have happened
12/12/2019, 11:11 - Bee: It's okayyy :)
12/12/2019, 11:13 - Bee: I'm in Panvel station waiting for the train. SO HARD TO WAIT
12/12/2019, 11:13 - Bee: I am. It was a lot of fun today. I made many little friends

12/12/2019, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: Praying that you'll have a wonderful time Debby 😊

13/12/2019, 00:23 - Nischal Abraham: I was thinking you're up pretty late, then I realised you're at a sleepover 😋. When you read this you're probably meeting Ruthy and Sammy so say hi to them for me!
13/12/2019, 00:23 - Nischal Abraham: I had two major highlights... And I have pictures for both. Explanations will only be on call so here's something to keep as a prompt to remind me to talk about it
13/12/2019, 00:24 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>

13/12/2019, 06:58 - Bee: Noted
13/12/2019, 06:58 - Bee: This I understood
13/12/2019, 06:58 - Bee: These I didn't...
13/12/2019, 06:58 - Bee: I remind you the next time we talk!
13/12/2019, 06:59 - Bee: I'll*
13/12/2019, 06:59 - Bee: I met the Samuel family!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
13/12/2019, 08:05 - Bee: I did :)
13/12/2019, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: !!!!
13/12/2019, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun at the wedding! Enjoy all the nice Indian wedding food 😭
13/12/2019, 12:12 - Bee: Awww Nischal
13/12/2019, 12:13 - Bee: Soooooon
13/12/2019, 12:13 - Bee: It's just starting
13/12/2019, 19:58 - Bee: Just reached a few minutes ago. I have this sports thing in college tomorrow so I'll be back by 2ish
13/12/2019, 19:58 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about your day
13/12/2019, 19:59 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
14/12/2019, 08:12 - Bee: Good morning. :)
14/12/2019, 08:13 - Bee: I'll reach home around 2. I'll catch up on lost sleep but after that I'm free. I would love to talk to you
14/12/2019, 08:13 - Bee: Let me know if you're free
14/12/2019, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I'm free from now for a few hours. Whenever you're done sleeping I'll be around :)
14/12/2019, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: So Rufus's church has a Christmas program today which I've been invited to. And he called me over to his home for lunch 😁
14/12/2019, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: But that also means we might not be able to talk today :(
14/12/2019, 12:58 - Bee: Hi Nischal
14/12/2019, 12:58 - Bee: I just woke up
14/12/2019, 12:59 - Bee: We'll talk another time then
14/12/2019, 12:59 - Bee: I'm sorry I slept too long
14/12/2019, 12:59 - Bee: Have fun! :)
14/12/2019, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. You must've been tired... How do you plan on sleeping at night if you sleep all day though 😂
14/12/2019, 15:20 - Bee: I'm so tired. I would've slept until tomorrow morning
14/12/2019, 15:20 - Bee: 😂
14/12/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Goodnight!
14/12/2019, 23:43 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! It was a fun night out. Terribly irresponsible but fun all the same. I think I subconsciously like being under stress cause I seem to keep creating it for myself 😶
15/12/2019, 09:26 - Bee: HI
15/12/2019, 09:27 - Bee: Irresponsible?! 😯
15/12/2019, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/12/2019, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Fairview has their carol service today
15/12/2019, 16:17 - Bee: Oh!!
15/12/2019, 16:17 - Bee: Dinner was with the girls of the assembly today
15/12/2019, 16:17 - Bee: I'm walking back home
15/12/2019, 16:17 - Bee: Is it in the assembly?
15/12/2019, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'm waiting over at Cherian's place instead of travelling back home
15/12/2019, 16:42 - Bee: Oh
15/12/2019, 16:42 - Bee: What was for lunch?

15/12/2019, 16:48 - Bee: Did you speak to anyone back home this week? (The one person a week thing) (the last one I remember was with Ruth. That thing)
15/12/2019, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Got two assignments to submit tomorrow

15/12/2019, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Spirit filled and today with slightly more people as well
15/12/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Had fun seeing all the kids of that assembly perform. It was basically like their Sunday school anniversary
15/12/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too Debby 😭😭
15/12/2019, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Just parents. I didn't get time to speak to anyone else
15/12/2019, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'm really sorry we haven't been able to talk these last few days... I haven't properly found time to message either. I'm praying for you everyday... I hope your days have been a blessing
15/12/2019, 17:30 - Bee: Oh...what time will you be back home today? Will you have time to work in them?
15/12/2019, 17:30 - Bee: 🤤 I had biryani for lunch too!
15/12/2019, 17:31 - Bee: Oh Nischal. What happened? Assignments?

15/12/2019, 17:32 - Bee: Kids!!! Did Rufus perform?
15/12/2019, 17:32 - Bee: 😶
15/12/2019, 17:35 - Bee: I'm equally at fault, if not more. Thank you for praying for me, Nischal. 
I'm praying for you everyday too. Many times everyday when something interesting or memorable happens I wish that I could share those moments with you in person. Someday
15/12/2019, 17:50 - Bee: And then I miss you more
15/12/2019, 17:50 - Bee: That's all
15/12/2019, 17:50 - Bee: That's why the message spam
15/12/2019, 17:58 - Bee: Weird request
15/12/2019, 17:59 - Bee: Do you have a recent photo of yourself
15/12/2019, 17:59 - Bee: If you don't then it's okay
15/12/2019, 17:59 - Bee: I just wanted to see you that's all
15/12/2019, 17:59 - Bee: That's a lot of messages. I'll stop.
15/12/2019, 17:59 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
16/12/2019, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free to talk today. Let me know if you are :)

16/12/2019, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: I need a haircut so bad 😂. Let's try and get on a video call and then you won't need a photo 😋
16/12/2019, 11:16 - Bee: I think I'm free too. I'll message once I reach home
16/12/2019, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: Don't stop! I wish there was more
16/12/2019, 11:26 - Bee: Okay!

16/12/2019, 13:04 - Bee: Nothing much happened today
16/12/2019, 13:04 - Bee: How's your day going?
16/12/2019, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: Pretty much the same... Feeling a bit down and I think it's cause I haven't slept properly

17/12/2019, 15:02 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. ☺
17/12/2019, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: Meeting with Daniel
17/12/2019, 15:02 - Bee: OH
17/12/2019, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... Sad right? 😂
17/12/2019, 15:03 - Bee: 😂
17/12/2019, 15:03 - Bee: You're funny, Nischal
17/12/2019, 15:04 - Bee: I didn't go for the meeting. I came home late today
17/12/2019, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Tired?
17/12/2019, 15:04 - Bee: And today is the fasting day. So I think it's good
17/12/2019, 15:04 - Bee: Not anymore
17/12/2019, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: So fasting for Lunch and dinner?

17/12/2019, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy praying :)
17/12/2019, 15:06 - Bee: :)
17/12/2019, 15:07 - Bee: Any new matters you want me to pray for?
17/12/2019, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: My lecture's done for the day as well
17/12/2019, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing new I guess. Just the old... CU has a carol service on Wednesday that's like an outreach for non-CU people so you can pray for that
17/12/2019, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: I've got tests on both Thursday and Friday
17/12/2019, 15:10 - Bee: Oh. Will be praying for these 3 along with the older matters. :)
17/12/2019, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: I've always wanted to fast and pray as well... But it seems like I fast more from laziness than intentionally 😞
17/12/2019, 16:06 - Bee: You can start with a meal. But I've learnt that fasting doesn't always have to be skipping meals
17/12/2019, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Thats true
17/12/2019, 17:40 - Bee: Marshmallow
17/12/2019, 17:43 - Bee: Hope today was goood ☺

19/12/2019, 22:20 - Nischal Abraham: 😮
19/12/2019, 22:21 - Nischal Abraham: I had fun btw... Not to disturb you, just updating. Did the worst I've ever been at bowling, then lost lazer tag... But it was all fun 😂😂
19/12/2019, 22:30 - Bee: 😯 aren't you really really good at bowling?!
19/12/2019, 22:30 - Bee: Your worst must've been a strike instead of 5 :P
19/12/2019, 22:31 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no I got a 0 twice in a row. My total was like in the 50s... I was THE worst in my lane 😂
19/12/2019, 22:39 - Bee: 😂 that's more than my usual score
19/12/2019, 22:49 - Bee: Before you go to sleep
I want to ask you to pray for me. I'm worried about the presentation
19/12/2019, 22:50 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely Debby. Did you get up early to prepare for it?
19/12/2019, 22:55 - Bee: Yes
19/12/2019, 22:59 - Nischal Abraham: Are you okay?
19/12/2019, 23:04 - Bee: Yes I'm okay
19/12/2019, 23:04 - Bee: :)
19/12/2019, 23:04 - Bee: How come you're you?
19/12/2019, 23:04 - Bee: 🤦🏻‍♀
19/12/2019, 23:04 - Bee: Up*
19/12/2019, 23:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'm the way God made me :)
19/12/2019, 23:05 - Bee: 😂
19/12/2019, 23:05 - Nischal Abraham: It's 11... I've just gotten used to sleeping at 12 because I've been coming home late everyday for the past few days
19/12/2019, 23:06 - Bee: Ahh... Did you have dinner outside?
19/12/2019, 23:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. It was nice... I tried beer for the first time and tastes just as bad as it smells 😅
19/12/2019, 23:07 - Bee: Yeah I think you either love it or hate it... There's no in between
19/12/2019, 23:07 - Nischal Abraham: Rufus has drama going on in his life but I'll tell you about that later... After you're done with your things
19/12/2019, 23:08 - Bee: Oh
19/12/2019, 23:08 - Bee: Nicole drama?
19/12/2019, 23:08 - Nischal Abraham: Am I keeping you away from studies?
19/12/2019, 23:08 - Bee: Later is good
19/12/2019, 23:09 - Nischal Abraham: That's the only one :P
19/12/2019, 23:09 - Bee: No I'm just going through the Powerpoint
19/12/2019, 23:09 - Nischal Abraham: Marathi?
19/12/2019, 23:09 - Bee: No this is in college. So English
19/12/2019, 23:10 - Bee: Oh nooo. I feel bad for him. He's a nice guy from what you've mentioned
19/12/2019, 23:11 - Nischal Abraham: He is... Everyone involved are really nice people... But emotions aren't usually controllable
19/12/2019, 23:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just hoping I'll be able to show him that his response to it can be controlled
19/12/2019, 23:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well not for you to be concerned about right now. You got up early and I really feel guilty to be chatting with you in the time you must've been planning for studies 😶
19/12/2019, 23:14 - Bee: If only I had learnt this lesson earlier
19/12/2019, 23:14 - Bee: It's okay. I wouldn't have replied if I was very busy
19/12/2019, 23:14 - Bee: I'll get back to it now
19/12/2019, 23:14 - Nischal Abraham: Same for me... And I took a bad turn for it
19/12/2019, 23:15 - Bee: You have a test today right?
19/12/2019, 23:15 - Nischal Abraham: Debby, I've prayed for you and I'm sure God will guide you through the day :). Hoping to hear how amazing it was
19/12/2019, 23:15 - Bee: I'll be praying
19/12/2019, 23:15 - Nischal Abraham: Had one today, have another tomorrow
19/12/2019, 23:16 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. ☺
19/12/2019, 23:16 - Bee: Yes I meant tomorrow. Which is today for me.
19/12/2019, 23:16 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. ☺
19/12/2019, 23:16 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... I'm sorry I genuinely thought you were asking about today 😂
19/12/2019, 23:17 - Bee: It's the time difference's fault
19/12/2019, 23:18 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! I'll be around for a bit if you want to talk. But don't make me your distraction, only as a help
19/12/2019, 23:18 - Bee: Okay. :) Aren't you sleepy though? It's almost 12
19/12/2019, 23:19 - Bee: No it's not

19/12/2019, 23:19 - Nischal Abraham: Okay now go :)... Talk later!
20/12/2019, 11:20 - Bee: HEY!
20/12/2019, 11:20 - Bee: The test went well. :)
20/12/2019, 11:21 - Bee: The presentation was postponed because the teacher had a last minute thing to do
But I had mustered up the courage to finish it so I was a little bummed
20/12/2019, 11:21 - Bee: I have more time to prepare thought
20/12/2019, 11:21 - Bee: Though*

21/12/2019, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: The assignment. Didn't you have to submit something today?
21/12/2019, 11:29 - Bee: OH. Yes
21/12/2019, 11:29 - Bee: I couldn't complete it. There were many others who didn't
21/12/2019, 11:29 - Bee: So I have until Monday to submit it
21/12/2019, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😊. I spoke to 3/4 of my family today... Been a while since I've had time to call them
21/12/2019, 11:36 - Bee: Oh.. missing home yet?
21/12/2019, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. There's too many Christmas activities left to enjoy to be wanting to go home 😂

21/12/2019, 11:56 - Bee: Oh!!! Are you excited?
21/12/2019, 11:57 - Bee: Yes. Were you there last year?

21/12/2019, 12:11 - Bee: OH. My bad. You mentioned Megan
21/12/2019, 12:11 - Nischal Abraham: So I have to meet her there at 2:30
21/12/2019, 12:11 - Bee: What time are you leaving then?
21/12/2019, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: I should take the 13:00 bus because the next bus is only an hour later
21/12/2019, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: And I can't risk the later bus being late. So I'll be leaving home in half an hour
21/12/2019, 12:15 - Bee: All packed and ready?
21/12/2019, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: I guess. It is just for a night. I'm getting good at packing for one night 😅
21/12/2019, 12:21 - Bee: I wish I could say that
21/12/2019, 12:21 - Bee: I'm reaching home in two. And then I have 5 minutes to change and leave. The meeting is at 6

22/12/2019, 02:26 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :)
22/12/2019, 02:26 - Bee: Nawwwwww
22/12/2019, 17:18 - Bee: I am alive but anxious about my exam tomorrow in case you were wondering
22/12/2019, 17:19 - Bee: I think that's passive aggressive
22/12/2019, 17:19 - Bee: Sorry. I'm a little extra needy than usual rn
22/12/2019, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: You have every right to be anxious. I did not take it to be any form of aggressive 😊. I'm praying you be well for your exam.
22/12/2019, 20:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be making for you the same prayer I've been making for my tests. That whatever the result be it may still lead to a testimony to glorify God.
I can see how that may not be an ideal prayer for many people so if it isn't right for you please let me know 😂
22/12/2019, 21:26 - Bee: It works for me.
22/12/2019, 21:26 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. :)
23/12/2019, 01:10 - Bee: Nischal

23/12/2019, 11:26 - Bee: Hey. It didn't go well
23/12/2019, 11:27 - Bee: I'm relieved that it's over
23/12/2019, 11:27 - Bee: Thank you for praying, Nischal
23/12/2019, 11:27 - Bee: :)
23/12/2019, 11:28 - Bee: This was me checking if you were awake... Just wanted to hear from you that's all
23/12/2019, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I guessed as much. I went to sleep by 12
23/12/2019, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: :(. I hope you're okay
23/12/2019, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: Is the next one tomorrow?

23/12/2019, 11:42 - Bee: Yes. Tomorrow
23/12/2019, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: Praying harder for your next one 😤
23/12/2019, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: What time will you be writing the paper?

23/12/2019, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh 2 hours. Is that a tough paper?
23/12/2019, 11:56 - Bee: OHHHH!!!! How short is it? Your first haircut in Ireland!! Did you take before-after photo?
23/12/2019, 11:56 - Bee: It is easier than today's but the portion is vaaaaassstt
23/12/2019, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay short. Not very. I did not take a photo though that sounds like a good idea for next time
23/12/2019, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: All the best studying for it! Are you home yet?

23/12/2019, 13:12 - Bee: Ummmmmmmmmmmm no?
23/12/2019, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: Studying can be fun. Is it not a subject you like?
23/12/2019, 13:13 - Bee: I like it but not when I have to study it for an exam
23/12/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: All a matter of perspective. You're studying it because you like it... And there just happens to be an exam on the very thing you like studying 😮
23/12/2019, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't that fortunate. Imagine having to write an exam on something you didn't study
23/12/2019, 13:20 - Bee: But I'm not studying it because I like it nana
23/12/2019, 13:20 - Bee: I'm studying because there's an exam
23/12/2019, 13:21 - Bee: It's amazing how your brain works though. 😶
23/12/2019, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
23/12/2019, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: I try. Regardless of the case you need to study. You'll be fine
23/12/2019, 14:15 - Bee: Thank you for trying. You're the best
23/12/2019, 14:16 - Bee: I learnt how to make cabbage sabji
23/12/2019, 14:16 - Bee: Mummy is in Mangalore for 10 days
23/12/2019, 14:16 - Bee: So it's papa Ashley Jason and I
23/12/2019, 14:18 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! That's amazing!! How was it?
23/12/2019, 14:18 - Nischal Abraham: More opportunity to improve cooking 😁. But I guess you'll be busy studying more
23/12/2019, 14:42 - Bee: I think it's good
23/12/2019, 14:43 - Bee: A little too spicy though. I got excited and added all the masalas

23/12/2019, 17:21 - Bee: Thanks ☺ it is easy

23/12/2019, 22:23 - Nischal Abraham: And I hope you feel okay for tomorrow :). If you are just going to bed then DO NOT reply even if you see my message. You need sleep
24/12/2019, 08:31 - Bee: Hey :)

24/12/2019, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be leaving for Cherian's in an hour. And I'm not in a state to keep up with the kids 😅
24/12/2019, 14:13 - Bee: 😂
24/12/2019, 14:13 - Bee: You'll meet your best friend!!
24/12/2019, 14:13 - Bee: Is there a Christmas special thing today?

24/12/2019, 15:11 - Bee: Have fun, Nischal :)
24/12/2019, 15:11 - Bee: I adored Nelson (my cousin) when I was little just like I'm sure Anaya adores you. It's a precious relationship
24/12/2019, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: If you've got time today we could make a quick call

25/12/2019, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: But I hope you got enough sleep last night 😊. I'm sitting here nodding to everything Anaya is saying

Remember everything she's saying. Kids say important things.
25/12/2019, 18:50 - Bee: Today Liza told me I'm good with kids (I never expected a kid to say that... But it's Liza so 🤷🏻‍♀)
25/12/2019, 18:51 - Bee: That's Anaya?
25/12/2019, 18:51 - Bee: I decided to go for the engagement
25/12/2019, 18:51 - Bee: I met Liza there
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Bee: She was very kind to me. She offered to get me more food and take my empty plate and bring me dessert
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nope that's Zachy
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Bee: Awwwwwwwww
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Bee: How are kids so cute
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Bee: Why do they grow up
25/12/2019, 18:52 - Bee: Becky's engagement
25/12/2019, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: She's still going on 😂. I've been sitting here for an hour now
25/12/2019, 18:53 - Bee: It was different. I'll tell you about it when we talk
25/12/2019, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Oh how was it!? I thought you weren't going
25/12/2019, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool
25/12/2019, 18:53 - Bee: Must have been a tiring day.
25/12/2019, 18:53 - Bee: I think so too
25/12/2019, 18:54 - Bee: I wasn't but there was an empty seat in Godwin and Joyce's car so I went
25/12/2019, 18:54 - Bee: Are the Cookies done?
25/12/2019, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Still going on
25/12/2019, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: There's too many distractions in this recipe
25/12/2019, 18:56 - Bee: 😂
25/12/2019, 18:56 - Bee: Go help!!
25/12/2019, 22:07 - Nischal Abraham: So my battery died mid reply. I had an amazing day. I've been thanking God every second and it doesn't feel enough... So I need to tell you everything so you can thank God for me too 😂
25/12/2019, 22:09 - Nischal Abraham: I know you should be studying. So I want you to think this properly and make a decision. If it's not possible then we'll wait till we're free :).
There's something I want to talk about with you. It's very specific and not just about things that have been happening. Let me know if it's possible to take 10 min (literally) to talk... The goodbye may have to be cut short if the 10 min are to be kept though 😅
25/12/2019, 22:10 - Nischal Abraham: P.s. sorry for the long message. I hope you had another night of great sleep 😊

26/12/2019, 05:58 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal:)
26/12/2019, 06:02 - Bee: It is possible. 10 minutes are more than okay. I'll be doing stuff at home so let me know whenever you're free. I'll take a break then
26/12/2019, 06:03 - Bee: Nooooooo long messages are good.
26/12/2019, 06:03 - Bee: I did sleep well
26/12/2019, 06:03 - Bee: I feel gooood today
26/12/2019, 06:03 - Bee: How are you?
26/12/2019, 06:08 - Bee: Still feverish?
26/12/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning/afternoon! I'm feeling much better today. I'm trying really hard not to let it get to my chest cause then I know it'll be very difficult to control
26/12/2019, 07:35 - Nischal Abraham: I think I've contained it fairly well. I had really good sleep in a very comfortable bed
26/12/2019, 07:36 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😁. Good mood to be studying in
26/12/2019, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: If we don't get to talk it'll probably be because I'm not finding any free time 🙁
26/12/2019, 14:44 - Bee: You're going to Daniel's today?
26/12/2019, 16:25 - Bee: I miss youuuu

27/12/2019, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: I had a great day. Still not done... There's dinner plans for tonight
27/12/2019, 18:46 - Bee: Tomorrow's got postponed to Monday
27/12/2019, 18:47 - Bee: I just wanted to finish them off
27/12/2019, 18:47 - Bee: That's nice! With Daniel's family?
27/12/2019, 18:48 - Bee: For whenever you see this

28/12/2019, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no... What about your college? Does that get postponed too then?
28/12/2019, 13:27 - Bee: No I'll have lectures until then
28/12/2019, 13:27 - Bee: I'm free too
28/12/2019, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: Oh

28/12/2019, 15:42 - Bee: I didn't cut the call

30/12/2019, 04:53 - Bee: What do they know about me? 🤔
30/12/2019, 04:53 - Bee: I think Jason has one. It's very embarrassing. It was an impromptu thing
30/12/2019, 04:54 - Bee: Wish!! I know I don't have to tell you that but just in case. You don't have a good track record of wishing people on their birthdays...
30/12/2019, 04:54 - Bee: Awwww and they're so young!! Goals

30/12/2019, 17:04 - Bee: It's our little secret
30/12/2019, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Whose secret?
30/12/2019, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: How'd it go? Sounds like more fun I'm missing 😭

01/01/2020, 02:31 - Bee: Party still going on?
01/01/2020, 02:31 - Nischal Abraham: Party's over. I'm at my resting place for the night
01/01/2020, 02:31 - Nischal Abraham: A kind couple named Noel and Lisa
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: Thank you. I am tired.. but I think we don't have lectures today so it's okay
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: Oh!!
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: How did the party go?
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: You can tell me tomorrow...
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: After you're well rested...
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Nischal Abraham: It was fun 😁. I'll detail it when you're done with college
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: Okay
01/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: The sarees weren't a flop
01/01/2020, 02:33 - Nischal Abraham: Actually, it might be longer. But I'll definitely try for today
01/01/2020, 02:33 - Bee: I saw you on the big screen!! You're famous!!!!
01/01/2020, 02:33 - Bee: Don't worry about it
01/01/2020, 02:33 - Nischal Abraham: No.... Sahil was famous 😂
01/01/2020, 02:33 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi didn't even hear what I said. Is it busy in college?
01/01/2020, 02:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy!
01/01/2020, 02:34 - Bee: Not today. I didn't hear anything either but I was sitting at the back so I thought maybe that's why
01/01/2020, 02:36 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it's cause you have no sleep and you're tired 😂
01/01/2020, 02:36 - Nischal Abraham: Well speaking of no sleep I should probably do that. Don't want to be getting up too late in the guests house
01/01/2020, 02:37 - Nischal Abraham: I have the loveliest room though. I don't think I'll want to get up 😭
01/01/2020, 02:37 - Bee: Haha...what do you mean loveliest? Comfy bed? A pretty color scheme?

Praying for your submission!
02/01/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Thank you. There's progress but I'm too sleepy to continue. I'll wake up in a few hours and do it
02/01/2020, 17:28 - Bee: How's your day going?
02/01/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: The situation at home is complicated. Well it's expected now that there's a family here. It'll take some time to find the balance living with them
02/01/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Other than that I bought supplies, threw out bad food, took a shower, just got up from an hour long nap
03/01/2020, 06:04 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)

03/01/2020, 08:45 - Nischal Abraham: There's enough noise for me to be earphoned in my room. So no studying at the dining table anymore. I can sit there if I'm just using my laptop or eating a meal
03/01/2020, 12:30 - Bee: I napped. No plans as such. I'll study for a while
03/01/2020, 12:30 - Bee: What's up?

And she told me about her conversation with aunty (the one I mentioned in the beginning of the message) and then she told me she knows why you're not homesick. Because we talk so much. And then she laughed and I left the room
03/01/2020, 14:13 - Bee: Wow that's a long message

05/01/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Here in Thane? 🤔
05/01/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: Na, here in Kilcock. That's probably got to do with me not leaving home yesterday though

05/01/2020, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: And I bought veggies for dinner. Gonna be eating healthy tonight 😊
05/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Veggies and rice?
05/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Would you like to talk?
05/01/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: You genius! 😮

05/01/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're free 😊
05/01/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Give me 10 minutes
05/01/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
05/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: On a video call with Joyce and the kids
05/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: Brb
05/01/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. I'm in no hurry
05/01/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Hey
05/01/2020, 16:39 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy
05/01/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Call?
05/01/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
05/01/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Maa said 'goodnight'
05/01/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Bye! ☺
05/01/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: 😅. Goodnight!
05/01/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: To all your family as well
06/01/2020, 02:31 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! :)
06/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: Praying that you sit down to study no matter what.
06/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: My day will be full of adorable newborns
06/01/2020, 02:32 - Bee: Hope your day goes well too
06/01/2020, 09:28 - Nischal Abraham: Have a wonderful time with newborns 😊. It started raining today too which is like the perfect excuse not to go to college... But I'll probably still go
06/01/2020, 11:12 - Bee: Why do you have to go to college though?
06/01/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's a good question. I was thinking I wouldn't study if I'm not in college. But I've got climbing plans for later in the evening and it'll probably be better to leave from home for that
06/01/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: So I should just study from home and leave in the evening
06/01/2020, 11:41 - Bee: Oh
06/01/2020, 11:41 - Bee: As long as your able to study
06/01/2020, 11:41 - Bee: You're*
06/01/2020, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... How's the hospital work going?
06/01/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Boring day today. I'm posted in the NICU for the week and there were very few babies
06/01/2020, 11:44 - Bee: I need to take the bus from the hospital to the station and the frequency is terrible
06/01/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Few babies in the NICU sounds like good news to me 😅
06/01/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done for the day already?
06/01/2020, 11:45 - Bee: It is good news!! But it also means there's hardly anything to do. And I'd rather have work because otherwise the day goes by very very slowly
06/01/2020, 11:46 - Bee: Yes. Finished at 4. The bus came at 4:40. Reached the station at 5. And the Thane train is at 5:20
06/01/2020, 11:46 - Bee: How's your day going?
06/01/2020, 11:52 - Nischal Abraham: You'd rather have sick babies!? 😱
06/01/2020, 11:53 - Bee: No I'd rather have work
06/01/2020, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: Alright. Cleaned the bathroom this morning, had a light breakfast, decided not to go to college so I'm in my room which is a mess but if I start cleaning it I'll be procrastinating from studying
06/01/2020, 11:54 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh I had porotha(I just realised I don't know how to spell that) and chicken curry last night
06/01/2020, 11:55 - Bee: OHHHH!! I don't know how to spell it either. Did you cook?
06/01/2020, 11:55 - Bee: So you're studying now? You don't have to reply. I don't want to disturb you
06/01/2020, 11:55 - Nischal Abraham: Nope Ciba did. And she very generously insisted she's cooking anyway and there's not enough place in the fridge so I can just eat what she's making
06/01/2020, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: I'm preparing to study now. Y'know the looking through all the subjects I need to cover over the next few days. I'm in the planning stage. Studies starts post lunch(which is gonna be early today in half an hour)
06/01/2020, 11:58 - Bee: She knows how to make porotta?! Wow
06/01/2020, 11:58 - Nischal Abraham: Na the porotta was frozen. But she did make the chicken curry
06/01/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Oh
06/01/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Reminded you of home?
06/01/2020, 11:58 - Nischal Abraham: It did 😭
06/01/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Now I'll have to learn to make chicken curry like that
06/01/2020, 12:13 - Bee: I know you can nana
06/01/2020, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: We'll see. Still haven't made an attempt at Chapatti. And Daniel has already tried it thrice 😂
06/01/2020, 12:27 - Bee: 😂
06/01/2020, 12:27 - Bee: Daniel is more Indian than you
06/01/2020, 12:27 - Bee: And me
06/01/2020, 12:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/01/2020, 12:29 - Bee: 😂
06/01/2020, 12:29 - Nischal Abraham: Looking good! And more importantly comfortable 😂
06/01/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Did you all color coordinate as well?
06/01/2020, 12:41 - Bee: Yes! It was fun. And comfortable
06/01/2020, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Reached home yet?
06/01/2020, 12:45 - Bee: No :(
06/01/2020, 12:45 - Bee: Waiting for the bus
06/01/2020, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: Have you had to wait for every vehicle you've travelled in today?
06/01/2020, 12:48 - Bee: Thane station
06/01/2020, 12:49 - Bee: On my way back yes.
06/01/2020, 12:50 - Bee: In the morning, no
06/01/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's unfortunate :(
06/01/2020, 12:52 - Bee: It is
06/01/2020, 12:52 - Bee: 🤷🏻‍♀
06/01/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Part of lofe
06/01/2020, 12:53 - Bee: Life*
06/01/2020, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. Buses here have a real time app for them so you can approximate when you can leave from a place
06/01/2020, 12:53 - Bee: If only we had one here
06/01/2020, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: But most places I need to go only require one bus ride so it's usually alright
06/01/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: If I had to change a bus and a train I'd still not be able to time it right
06/01/2020, 12:54 - Bee: 7 more months
06/01/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Till you get paid to do it?
06/01/2020, 12:55 - Bee: 😂
06/01/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Touche
06/01/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Well it's alright as long as you find something to do in that time. I didn't mind travelling to work but it's mostly cause I could choose my time to go
06/01/2020, 12:56 - Bee: You got to sleep in Nischal
06/01/2020, 12:56 - Bee: 😭
06/01/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: I did. But those are times in the past. Who knows what the future has for me
06/01/2020, 12:57 - Bee: Yes
06/01/2020, 12:57 - Bee: 6 for you
06/01/2020, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Its sort of 6. I'll be cycling in the summer so no bus hassles then
06/01/2020, 13:02 - Bee: The reality of it just hit me
06/01/2020, 13:06 - Nischal Abraham: Is me cycling so surprising?
06/01/2020, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: It'll surprise you but it'll end up feeling both long and short when you're through with it. That's how I've felt for most major milestones in my life
06/01/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Are we still talking about cycling?
06/01/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: We could be 😂
06/01/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: But to be fair I was referring to the 7 months
06/01/2020, 13:12 - Bee: Of what may come after the 7 months
06/01/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you're not overthinking in the negative again
06/01/2020, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: Actually.... What is to come after 7 months?
06/01/2020, 13:14 - Bee: No no I'm not
06/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Where will I be
Where will you be
How long it'll take for both places to be the same
06/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: But it's not for me to worry about
06/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: God knows the end from the beginning
06/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: That's my hope
06/01/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Amen to that
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's my hope to :)
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Too*
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Bee: Lunch?
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Done
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Bee: Oh
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Bee: So studying now?
06/01/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: I should probably get to studying now
06/01/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: I really really really don't want to... But I should
06/01/2020, 13:20 - Bee: Okay.
06/01/2020, 13:20 - Bee: You should!!
06/01/2020, 13:20 - Bee: I prayed for you. And I'll continue to pray
06/01/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. Have a safe trip back home
06/01/2020, 16:29 - Bee: Hey. Hope you're alright. I couldn't not message you. No need to reply. Bye!
06/01/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hii. Waiting at the bus stop for 20 minutes since I'm terrible at timing things
06/01/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: You've definitely got another early day tomorrow. Sleep well Debs... Thanks a million for the prayers
06/01/2020, 16:57 - Bee: How's the fever?
06/01/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Yes. Going to sleep in a bit
06/01/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Have fun, Nischal! :)
06/01/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Don't feel it anymore
06/01/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Oh btw, transport here is do much worse than in Mumbai. The bus just postponed to another half an hour from now
06/01/2020, 17:21 - Bee: You're still waiting for the bus?! :O
06/01/2020, 17:34 - Bee: What advice would you give to yourself on January 1st of last year?
06/01/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Goodnight!
06/01/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe God doesn't want you to go to Canada at this moment
07/01/2020, 06:34 - Bee: When did you realize for sure? That Canada wasn't working out?
07/01/2020, 06:34 - Bee: But why Canada?
07/01/2020, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: Canada seemed like the logical place to go to advance my career. I realised it wouldn't work out only after Ireland did
07/01/2020, 11:19 - Bee: 😃
07/01/2020, 11:25 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going? I'm just heading out to college to study now
07/01/2020, 11:50 - Bee: My day was the same as yesterday. Except for all the swaddling I did today
07/01/2020, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! I'm sorry for not replying, I'll be back online in 2 hours or so
07/01/2020, 13:05 - Bee: Don't be sorry. Take your time. :)
07/01/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee
07/01/2020, 17:11 - Bee: Hey :)
07/01/2020, 17:11 - Bee: We had guests over for dinner
07/01/2020, 17:12 - Bee: Sam uncle and Margaret aunty are here. So the whole fam came over
07/01/2020, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Sounds like lovely company
07/01/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Yes!! A lot of interesting conversations and funny stories
07/01/2020, 17:17 - Bee: How's your day going?
07/01/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Still in college?
07/01/2020, 17:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/01/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: I am still in college. I think I've saturated my studying capacity now
07/01/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Oh
07/01/2020, 18:06 - Bee: I'll go to sleep
07/01/2020, 18:06 - Bee: I'm exhausted
07/01/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Hope you've had a good day
07/01/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
07/01/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby 😊. I'm really sorry I haven't been able to message properly today
07/01/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: But I did have a good day. Managed to do a bit of studying coming to the uni. I'm just coming here everyday now
07/01/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Seems very biased 😑
08/01/2020, 07:05 - Bee: I found it on Pinterest. So it must be true :P
08/01/2020, 07:05 - Bee: That's great :)
08/01/2020, 07:05 - Bee: Good morning!
08/01/2020, 10:04 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
08/01/2020, 12:09 - Bee: How's the studying going?
08/01/2020, 12:09 - Bee: What's for lunch?
08/01/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Just gonna start for the day. We came to a cafe in Maynooth. No idea what'll be for lunch
08/01/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
08/01/2020, 12:58 - Bee: My day was good. I'm already home which is early. Got the bus on time
08/01/2020, 12:59 - Bee: I have a submission for tomorrow. I'll work on that after sometime
08/01/2020, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice. Your probably working on your submission now. This cafe is a nice place to be in. I've never done work in a cafe before... Feel like a proper professional now 😁
08/01/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Hey
08/01/2020, 17:31 - Bee: How's it going?
08/01/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Hope you're having a productive day :)
08/01/2020, 17:32 - Bee: I'm half done with the assignment. Too tired to continue. I'll sleep for a bit and then finish our
08/01/2020, 17:32 - Bee: It*
08/01/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm making good progress today. Don't know how productive I've been but better something than nothing
08/01/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Though I guess it's good morning whenever you read this 😁
08/01/2020, 22:46 - Bee: Hey that's good!
08/01/2020, 22:46 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
09/01/2020, 09:34 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Did you manage to complete your assignment?
09/01/2020, 12:19 - Bee: I did. But I hated the anxiety that came with completing an assignment just before the submission :(
09/01/2020, 12:19 - Bee: I wish I didn't procrastinate as much as I do
09/01/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: You and me both
09/01/2020, 12:34 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you had a good day today :)
09/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Not really. I'm just glad it's over
09/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: How's your day going?
09/01/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Today's just started. Had brunch at 11 and now I start studying
09/01/2020, 13:17 - Bee: Oh. Not going to college or a cafe to study today?
09/01/2020, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'm in college now
09/01/2020, 13:30 - Bee: Oh! Lunch?
09/01/2020, 13:31 - Bee: Praying that you have a productive day ☺
09/01/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee... Na I'll just have a heavy dinner
09/01/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Hey
09/01/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy! Not sleeping yet?
09/01/2020, 18:59 - Bee: I'm having a splitting headache. I slept in the evening because I couldn't stay up
09/01/2020, 18:59 - Bee: But it's still there
09/01/2020, 18:59 - Bee: And I have a seminar to present tomorrow. Everything is ready. I need to revise. I thought I'd do it after I wake up but I don't know now
09/01/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Still having the headache?
09/01/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Yes :(
09/01/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Are you planning on staying up long tonight?
09/01/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe try and get some more sleep
09/01/2020, 19:05 - Bee: That was the plan
09/01/2020, 19:05 - Bee: I'll do that
09/01/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Pray for me?
09/01/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Thank you
09/01/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Bye.
09/01/2020, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: I already have :)
09/01/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you feel better.
09/01/2020, 22:43 - Bee: Thank you Nischal
09/01/2020, 22:43 - Bee: I'm feeling much better
09/01/2020, 22:49 - Bee: Hope you've had a good day
09/01/2020, 22:54 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Happy to hear you're feeling better
09/01/2020, 22:54 - Nischal Abraham: I did get studies done today
10/01/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Hey :)
10/01/2020, 12:25 - Bee: The seminar didn't happen
10/01/2020, 12:25 - Bee: The teacher postponed it
10/01/2020, 12:25 - Bee: :(
10/01/2020, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
10/01/2020, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... So did you have a normal college day then?
10/01/2020, 12:34 - Bee: Hey!
10/01/2020, 12:34 - Bee: I did
10/01/2020, 12:34 - Bee: Not really
10/01/2020, 12:34 - Bee: I didn't
10/01/2020, 12:34 - Bee: The seminar was supposed to happen from 3 to 4:30
10/01/2020, 12:35 - Bee: But I got to know that it's postponed only around 2:30
10/01/2020, 12:35 - Bee: Thank you for praying though.
10/01/2020, 12:35 - Bee: That headache disappeared
10/01/2020, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: Well at least now you're ready for whenever it'll happen right?
10/01/2020, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done for the day?
10/01/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Yes
10/01/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Yes

10/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: What're you up to?
10/01/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Was doing stuff around the house
10/01/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Now preparing to go to sleep
10/01/2020, 18:14 - Bee: That's why the late reply :(
10/01/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ah no problem. I was busy solving a problem myself 😅
10/01/2020, 18:16 - Bee: Oh! How's the studying going? On your way back home?
10/01/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Still on the problem. Still in the lab 😂
10/01/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo! Finally done 😩
10/01/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Must be quite the problem. Meeting with your professor done?
10/01/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. It went well :). It's pretty late for you now isn't it...

11/01/2020, 04:37 - Bee: Heyyyyyyy
11/01/2020, 04:37 - Bee: ☺☺☺☺☺☺🤗
11/01/2020, 05:22 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. ☺
11/01/2020, 05:34 - Bee: I'm having fever.
11/01/2020, 05:34 - Bee: Baby fever.
11/01/2020, 07:17 - Bee: Nischallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
11/01/2020, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hii!
11/01/2020, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debs. You seem to be in good moods today 😁
11/01/2020, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: I guess this in one fever you don't want to end 😂
11/01/2020, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: Is*
11/01/2020, 10:14 - Bee: Saturdays do that to me.
11/01/2020, 10:17 - Bee: You're guessing right.
11/01/2020, 10:17 - Bee: What's today like for you?
11/01/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: The view out the window is sultry and VERY windy
11/01/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: But I'm in good moods too
11/01/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: There is a plan to go to college to study. But I'll see how bad the winds get and decide. Probably find a way to study at home
11/01/2020, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/fD4rxj7-uO0
11/01/2020, 10:27 - Nischal Abraham: Just go through the last 30 seconds when you can where the crowd is singing. Made my mood today 😁
11/01/2020, 11:08 - Bee: You're the first person that I know personally who has used the word sultry
11/01/2020, 11:08 - Bee: Aye aye captain
11/01/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you were here you'd be saying the same thing
11/01/2020, 12:01 - Bee: 🤔
11/01/2020, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: How goes your day?
11/01/2020, 13:11 - Bee: My day was good
11/01/2020, 13:14 - Bee: I became emotional a few times. 2 babies came directly from the labour room. They were to be kept under observation. And I got to feed them. The first time they ate was when I fed them 😭
11/01/2020, 13:21 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. That's sounds amazing!
11/01/2020, 14:48 - Bee: It was
11/01/2020, 14:48 - Bee: Hope your day is going well
11/01/2020, 14:54 - Bee: Just letting you know that I'm free if you want to talk. If you're busy studying then it's okay. :)
11/01/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I didn't even realise what time it is 😮
11/01/2020, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: Done snacking?
11/01/2020, 14:56 - Bee: Yes. Papa and I went to this new place that's opened a few doors down from Prashant
11/01/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm free to talk whenever you are
11/01/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Well I'm free to talk whenever you are
11/01/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Now?
12/01/2020, 14:31 - Bee: Hey
12/01/2020, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Hii
12/01/2020, 14:35 - Bee: Hows your day going?
12/01/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: It's been good. Did you sleep well?
12/01/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Last night? Today afternoon? Yes and yes
12/01/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. That's good 😊
12/01/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Just got back home
12/01/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day? Any progress on the Sunday school?
12/01/2020, 15:00 - Bee: Brb
12/01/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
12/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: My day went well ☺
12/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Sunday school in Dharamveer Nagar will start from the 26th
12/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Not next week because we need to pray and prepare
12/01/2020, 15:27 - Bee: Timings will be the same. Smaller classes. More teachers
12/01/2020, 15:27 - Bee: But the number of teachers who attended the meeting today was the same as before. We may need more
12/01/2020, 15:28 - Bee: What are you doing?
12/01/2020, 15:28 - Bee: What was for lunch?
12/01/2020, 15:28 - Bee: How are you?
12/01/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well I changed and had a chocolate since I got home.
12/01/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Are you sitting near the duvet? :P
12/01/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: Subway
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing really good now 😊
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'll always be near it in my room 😶
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Now? Details?
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Bee: That's why the delay
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: What delay!?
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Bee: 😂
12/01/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Jk
12/01/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Well last night I was disturbed. But this morning was beautiful. And worship was good. And now I'm feeling the tiredness of waking up at 5:30 😂
12/01/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: My body's only used to 9:30
12/01/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Did you sleep alright? At least until 5:30
12/01/2020, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well I only managed to sleep by 12. I couldn't fall asleep earlier
12/01/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Did you have dinner yet?
12/01/2020, 15:40 - Bee: Planning on sleeping early tonight? Or will you be up studying?
12/01/2020, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: Probably sleep early and get up early. I don't like staying up to study
12/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: I will in 3
12/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Oh. Cool. I prefer staying up
12/01/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hours?
12/01/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: I used to try to. But then I just end up really sleepy and nothing goes into my head. I don't mind staying up for assignments but I find it really hard to study that way
12/01/2020, 16:01 - Bee: :O
12/01/2020, 16:01 - Bee: Minutes?
12/01/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Seconds?
12/01/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Oh. It's that way for me in the mornings. And I'm panicking on the morning of the exam so I can't study anyway
12/01/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Milliseconds?
12/01/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Microseconds?
12/01/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. I don't panic so maybe that's why I study then. Well I wish I panicked earlier then I'd study more
12/01/2020, 16:06 - Bee: Nanoseconds?
12/01/2020, 16:06 - Bee: Panicking a day before is panicking earlier
12/01/2020, 16:09 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/01/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: THAT'S PRETTY!!
12/01/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: But I don't
12/01/2020, 16:12 - Bee: Picoseconds?
You lost
12/01/2020, 16:12 - Bee: Thanks
12/01/2020, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
12/01/2020, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I just gave up at nano
12/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: Maybe you don't have to panic. You don't need to panic to get stuff done.
12/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: Ha.
12/01/2020, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: If I'm not wrong the next is fermiseconds
12/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: But you lost. You can't continue now
12/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: Femto?
12/01/2020, 16:14 - Bee: Planck?
12/01/2020, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: I admit defeat. What's for dinner?
12/01/2020, 16:14 - Bee: I don't know why I remember this
12/01/2020, 16:14 - Bee: There's kanji, dry fish chutney, pickle. Sunday special
12/01/2020, 16:16 - Nischal Abraham: Interesting facts to remember 😂
12/01/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. I've got an unusual appetite today. Feeling hungry already. I think its the early breakfast that's ruined my routine again
12/01/2020, 16:19 - Bee: Again. The opposite. I dont feel like eating today :O I'm having an orange
12/01/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: Skipping on kanji?
12/01/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Yes
12/01/2020, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you're feeling okay. Heavy lunch?
12/01/2020, 16:51 - Bee: No I had very little for lunch too. Feeling weird
12/01/2020, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Weird?
12/01/2020, 17:16 - Bee: No appetite but I'm feeling weak
12/01/2020, 17:16 - Bee: What are you doing?
12/01/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Planning on eating now and then sitting down for studies. Somehow it being dark out just makes me think it's dinner time already
12/01/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: :(
12/01/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you aren't sick. Hospital or college tomorrow?
12/01/2020, 17:51 - Bee: I hope so too. I don't want to miss work
12/01/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Hospital until Thursday. college on Friday
12/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: What's for dinner?
12/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Praying that you're able to push yourself to study
12/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.” (Colossians 3:23-24).
12/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: You know this already. But reminders don't hurt
12/01/2020, 18:03 - Bee: "God is always faithful in giving his children all they need. He calls us to cast out burdens on Him. All things we always know but it never hurts to hear again"
This is what you sent a day before my exam and it was much needed encouragement
12/01/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Praying for you, Nischal. :)
12/01/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Goodnight ☺
12/01/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby. You making me cry before my exams 😂. It's good tears though. 
I'm always thanking God for you and it never seems enough
12/01/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying you feel better tomorrow and have an amazing day
13/01/2020, 04:59 - Bee: Nawwwww now you're making me cry
13/01/2020, 04:59 - Bee: I am feeling better. :)
13/01/2020, 04:59 - Bee: Praying for you. What time is the exam?
13/01/2020, 04:59 - Bee: Don't reply if you're busy. Let me know how it goes
13/01/2020, 07:29 - Nischal Abraham: Exam is at my 15:30. It's pretty late in the day. And all the exams are set at that time for 3 hours
13/01/2020, 11:29 - Bee: Wow it'll be late
13/01/2020, 11:29 - Bee: How are you?
13/01/2020, 11:29 - Bee: Again don't reply if you're occupied.
13/01/2020, 11:29 - Bee: Praying. Bye.
13/01/2020, 14:06 - Bee: You may be on your way to college. Praying for you, Nischal. Our God is your stronghold. ☺🤗
Do not reply. Bye.
13/01/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: The paper went well. Waiting for the bus in a storm now 😂
13/01/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you had a great day Debby. I'm sorry I couldn't talk anymore today. It'll probably be like this for the rest of the week
13/01/2020, 23:09 - Bee: Praise God!!! ☺
13/01/2020, 23:10 - Bee: I did. :)
And don't be sorry
13/01/2020, 23:10 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal :)
14/01/2020, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby!
14/01/2020, 09:11 - Nischal Abraham: Could we talk today? It's fine if you're busy with something, but if you happen to be free for just a little while later could you let me know. Thanks :)
14/01/2020, 10:01 - Bee: I should be free...what time?
14/01/2020, 10:34 - Nischal Abraham: Whenever you are free. I'm on study day today so I'll just take a break when you're free to talk
14/01/2020, 11:34 - Bee: Okay :)
14/01/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: If you could, let me know a few minutes before you get free I'll be able to make sure I'm free at the same time too
14/01/2020, 11:40 - Bee: Okay
14/01/2020, 11:40 - Bee: You okay?
14/01/2020, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. But it's not an immediate issue
14/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Oh :(
14/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: 7:30?
14/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Your 2
14/01/2020, 13:16 - Bee: Anytime after that.
14/01/2020, 13:16 - Bee: I'm still on my way home. I'll reach in 10
14/01/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Don't worry about it though :(. I'll be fine. Just need to talk that's all
14/01/2020, 14:05 - Bee: Nischal
14/01/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
14/01/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Call?
14/01/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Nischal
15/01/2020, 13:26 - Bee: Hey!! Trying to hold myself back from messaging you but clearly I'm not doing a good job 😂
Praying for you. Do well. 
Do not reply!!
15/01/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy! My net was off most of the day cause I was so busy with studies. The paper went alright. But I'm happy with it. I did the best that I could and actually really studied for this one
15/01/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you had a good day too 😊
16/01/2020, 05:53 - Bee: I'm so happy!!! ☺
16/01/2020, 05:53 - Bee: I had a good day. :)
16/01/2020, 05:54 - Bee: And good morning! :)
16/01/2020, 06:05 - Bee: I didn't go to the hospital today. Came home late last night. Had to wait for the bus for around an hour. Decided to sleep in today.
16/01/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up sleeping in too 😂. But I only need to go to college to study. Tomorrow is my full theory paper for System Requirements. Absolutely dreadful subject 😩
16/01/2020, 12:08 - Bee: One more day and you never have to study it again!!!
16/01/2020, 12:09 - Bee: It's very cold here. Freezing. And by freezing I mean 18 degrees.
16/01/2020, 12:11 - Bee: I'm not a big fan of the cold so I was feeling a little down. But I went to the kitchen a few minutes ago and the sunrays were streaming in which hardly ever happens even in the summer because there are trees outside the kitchen window and it looked so beautiful
16/01/2020, 12:11 - Bee: Needless to say, you don't have to reply
16/01/2020, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lovely view. I know you said I don't have to reply... But 18 degrees is cold
16/01/2020, 17:39 - Bee: It is. New Zealand is warmer rn
16/01/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Nischallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
16/01/2020, 17:39 - Bee: I hope you're having a productive day
16/01/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Thinking of you often. Praying for you often.
16/01/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Goodnight. :)

24/01/2020, 10:18 - Bee: At home today?
24/01/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. For the most part. I may go out shopping for groceries later in the day
24/01/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Is it affecting your throat or your head or both?
24/01/2020, 10:23 - Bee: Both 😔
24/01/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby :(. I'm praying for you so you just sleep and enjoy your forced off days okay
24/01/2020, 10:25 - Bee: Thank you :)
24/01/2020, 10:25 - Bee: Colds are the worst. Anything else is okay but a cold? No thank you.
24/01/2020, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: I disagree with anything else being okay 😂. But colds are no fun
24/01/2020, 10:48 - Bee: By anything else I meant fever and cough... Not cancer or an accidental :P
24/01/2020, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
24/01/2020, 10:49 - Nischal Abraham: Fever and coughs are no fun either though.
24/01/2020, 10:51 - Bee: But with fever and cough we can still go about our day
24/01/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Not with a cold though
24/01/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough. You must be finding it difficult to text as well right? It's fine if you can't. Rest up Debby :)
24/01/2020, 11:05 - Bee: Yes the pills I took are making me sleepy. I shall take a nap
24/01/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Nischal!!
24/01/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Hi
24/01/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How are you feeling now?
24/01/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Had a nice nap?
24/01/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I did
24/01/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Feeling much better
24/01/2020, 14:08 - Bee: My college has arranged a visit to a leprosy home. I was looking forward to it
24/01/2020, 14:08 - Bee: What's up?
24/01/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: Was that happening today?
24/01/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'm trying hard not to be lazy and get out of the house to go buy stuff
24/01/2020, 14:13 - Bee: No it's tomorrow
24/01/2020, 14:13 - Bee: Have you made a list?
24/01/2020, 14:13 - Bee: Is there a park nearby?
24/01/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Too cold for a park.
24/01/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: That's unfortunate. I have made a list... It's just the act of dressing up to get out
24/01/2020, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: Not that I know of
24/01/2020, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: This is true 😂. I'd rather not be spending time outdoors too much
24/01/2020, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: What're you up to?
24/01/2020, 14:25 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/01/2020, 14:26 - Bee: I watched The chronicles of Narnia as a child but didn't like it very much. And everyone keeps talking about how good it is. And I found it on Netflix. I put it on the TV. Now I'm thinking whether I really want to spend 2 hours watching a movie
24/01/2020, 14:26 - Bee: This is what I'm up to
24/01/2020, 14:32 - Bee: Would you like to talk.
24/01/2020, 14:32 - Bee: ?*
24/01/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: The Lion the witch and the wardrobe is a nice movie
24/01/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: The whole Chronicles of Narnia is a good book series
24/01/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Whether you want to spend 2 hours on a movie is an entirely different problem
24/01/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: If you're up to it then I'd love to. But I don't want you to strain if you aren't feeling well
24/01/2020, 14:45 - Bee: I'll be fine
24/01/2020, 14:45 - Bee: When are you going grocery shopping? Is after that okay?
24/01/2020, 14:45 - Bee: I'll watch it in installments
24/01/2020, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'll leave in a while. Eating something before I do. We could just talk when I'm walking to the shop and back if that's okay with you.
24/01/2020, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know what time is good for you
24/01/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Okay! I need 10 more minutes. Let me know when you leave
24/01/2020, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sure :)
24/01/2020, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: Debby
24/01/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Nischal
24/01/2020, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
24/01/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Hi
24/01/2020, 15:24 - Bee: I'll call?
24/01/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5 min
24/01/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Just need to wear my shoes
24/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Okay
24/01/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
24/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Hi
24/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Give me 10
24/01/2020, 15:57 - Bee: I'm having dinner
24/01/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Enjoy :)
24/01/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: That should work out perfectly. I'll be home to call then
24/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: I'm free. :) Let me know when you reach home
24/01/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!! I'm home now
24/01/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I'll call?
24/01/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1B9hvONtn0YaBA22VJQRUM?si=5P9M38ayT9-ioIfR3dSErg
24/01/2020, 17:51 - Bee: 😶
24/01/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: It happened! 😮
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Did you make it a collaborative playlist
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Yes. Wasn't that a perfectly timed bye though
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: What if we had not said bye
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yes. Did it make any difference
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Would've been worse for be
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Me
24/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: It did!!
24/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Are you talking about the playlist
24/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: That message was for this 😂
24/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: I was talking about the bye 😂
24/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I know!!
24/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I wasn't being mean Debby. I'm just really slow at typing
24/01/2020, 17:54 - Bee: I didn't think you were being mean
24/01/2020, 17:54 - Bee: It didn't make any difference
24/01/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Well then I guess I'll just keep adding songs and you can listen to them at leisure :)
24/01/2020, 17:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/01/2020, 17:55 - Bee: So*
24/01/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: It was
24/01/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Until we find it how to do it
24/01/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. Maybe it doesn't work on the free version of Spotify?
24/01/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I don't know. Sahil has premium. I'll ask him if it happens on his
24/01/2020, 17:56 - Bee: NISCHAL
24/01/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I added a song to that playlist
24/01/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo! How'd you manage?
24/01/2020, 17:57 - Bee: The usual process of adding a song to a playlist but I selected your playlist
24/01/2020, 17:58 - Bee: I've heard dancing in the minefields before! And I like it
24/01/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice. Cool it works then 😊
24/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Yes ☺
24/01/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: The song isn't that cheesy. It just sounds very 2000s
24/01/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Reminds me of Lady Antebellum
24/01/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Aren't the lyrics cheesy
24/01/2020, 18:00 - Bee: 2 tbsp oil heat then add jeera and black pepper and then add onion and stir then add ginger garlic add keema wait till it gets brown then add salt red chilly and Garam Madala  add coriander powder then mix and add 1 cup water then let it sit for 10 minutes then add rice

24/01/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the recipe!
24/01/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: I guess the lyrics are kinda cheesy. Current me would not play it on repeat
24/01/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: But there was a time I would've
24/01/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Oh
24/01/2020, 18:02 - Bee: When?
24/01/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: 9th to 12th standard
24/01/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Oh
24/01/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Current me plays it on repeat
24/01/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Old me played it on repeat too
24/01/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice 😁. My music taste keeps changing a lot
24/01/2020, 18:06 - Bee: But cheese is forever
24/01/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Sure. But there's different kinds of cheese
24/01/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Sure. I don't discriminate though :P
24/01/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: You are a better person than I am 😋
24/01/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: Are you not sleepy? It must be pretty late for you right?
24/01/2020, 18:15 - Bee: I'm trying to go to sleep but I'm not sleepy. Must be all the daytime naps I had
24/01/2020, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea makes sense. So what do you plan to do?
24/01/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Currently I'm mindlessly looking at memes on Instagram
24/01/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds productive
24/01/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Surprise
It is not
24/01/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
24/01/2020, 18:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/01/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be honest I've run out of things to talk about right now
24/01/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Okay
24/01/2020, 18:26 - Bee: 10 points for your honesty
24/01/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I'll mindlessly scroll through Instagram after I say goodnight
24/01/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
24/01/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! :). If you want to talk I can keep chatting
24/01/2020, 18:27 - Bee: No it's okay
24/01/2020, 18:27 - Bee: What are you doing?
24/01/2020, 18:27 - Bee: Aren't you 10 years too early though
24/01/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Going through my mail. Reading some articles
24/01/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Is there a time limit?
24/01/2020, 18:27 - Bee: Isn't there?
24/01/2020, 18:28 - Bee: I thought there was
24/01/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think we'd ever run out as long as we're living
24/01/2020, 18:28 - Bee: 😒
24/01/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: *right now*
24/01/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: It's not permanent
24/01/2020, 18:29 - Bee: We'll see
24/01/2020, 18:29 - Bee: Bye!
24/01/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Bye (not using any nicknames) Debby!
24/01/2020, 18:29 - Bee: 😶
25/01/2020, 09:03 - Bee: Nischal
25/01/2020, 09:03 - Bee: Late night?
25/01/2020, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. Yea it ended up being late
25/01/2020, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: How are you feeling?
25/01/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Much better
25/01/2020, 10:42 - Bee: I should be okay by Monday
25/01/2020, 10:42 - Bee: I'm watching The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe
25/01/2020, 10:42 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear it ☺
25/01/2020, 10:43 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. Planning on installments or one sitting?
25/01/2020, 10:43 - Bee: Watche half the movie. I think I'll finish it in one sitting
25/01/2020, 10:43 - Bee: Watched*
25/01/2020, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool. Enjoy :). Its not really dragging so you won't feel bored if its your first time watching. Especially the second half
25/01/2020, 10:50 - Bee: I like the beavers the most
25/01/2020, 11:50 - Bee: 😭
25/01/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: What's wrong?
25/01/2020, 12:11 - Bee: I finished the movie
25/01/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Liked it?
25/01/2020, 12:13 - Bee: LOVED IT
25/01/2020, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😁
25/01/2020, 13:05 - Bee: What's up?
25/01/2020, 13:07 - Bee: The sky is so pretty outside
25/01/2020, 13:07 - Bee: So many colors
25/01/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: My sky is fairly dull today as well. Wish I were there
25/01/2020, 13:40 - Bee: Don't worry. It's dark now
25/01/2020, 13:40 - Bee: :)
25/01/2020, 14:48 - Nischal Abraham: I still wish I was there 😂. It wasn't the sky I wanted to see
25/01/2020, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner? I'm considering progress that I had lunch kind of on time today 😁
25/01/2020, 14:59 - Bee: Then what did you want to see, Nischal?
25/01/2020, 14:59 - Bee: There's egg curry and rice. Too early for dinner though
25/01/2020, 14:59 - Bee: I had mutton soup in the evening
25/01/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Chronicles of Narnia of course
25/01/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! I need to learn to make soups in general. I hate all the packet ones I've bought so far
25/01/2020, 15:02 - Bee: What was for lunch?
25/01/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Aren't there illegal ways to download it?
25/01/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: I would never 😮
25/01/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Carrots, mushroom, boiled potatoes and eggs
25/01/2020, 15:14 - Bee: 😂😂
25/01/2020, 15:18 - Bee: Oh Nischal
25/01/2020, 15:18 - Bee: What a healthy lunch
25/01/2020, 15:18 - Bee: Try to gain weight!!
25/01/2020, 15:18 - Bee: But how
25/01/2020, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: Well I had MacDonalds on Thursday so that should be weight gaining right? 😂
25/01/2020, 15:35 - Bee: 😂
25/01/2020, 15:36 - Bee: If that was true I would've been obese
25/01/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: What nana... You don't gain weight no matter where you eat
25/01/2020, 15:47 - Bee: Right back at ya nana
25/01/2020, 15:47 - Bee: But you wait for 10 more years nana. It will be the opposite 😂
25/01/2020, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: You're saying I'll gain weight in 10 years?
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: I'm saying in 10 years everything I eat will increase my weight
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: What's up?
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: How are you?
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: What are you doing?
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: Wait I asked you that already
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: It'll probably be the same for me.
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: What color is your bedsheet?
25/01/2020, 16:22 - Bee: Okay. We'll compete.
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: In my room. On my bed
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well :)
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: On my phone chatting with you is one of the things
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Blue. It'll always be blue
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Bee: 🤔
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Bee: Is it the blue and grey
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Noooo.  That's a terrible thing to compete over 😂
25/01/2020, 16:23 - Bee: Or the other blue
25/01/2020, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: It's more of a blue and green for my bedsheet. My duvet cover is blue and grey
25/01/2020, 16:24 - Bee: 😂
Now the it is to see who gains weight faster
In 10 years it'll be to see who doesn't gain weight
25/01/2020, 16:24 - Bee: The evil duvet
25/01/2020, 16:24 - Bee: I don't want to gain any more weight tho
25/01/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: The washing machine is broken and won't be fixed for another 2 or 3 days so I'll have to be clever about using stuff
25/01/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: It's the coziest thing. Lifesaver really
25/01/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Enjoy whatever you have at the moment. And when the time comes to gain weight we'll enjoy that too 😁
25/01/2020, 16:29 - Bee: Fiiiiiinnne.
25/01/2020, 16:30 - Bee: ☺ I like this statement
25/01/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: What're you doing?
25/01/2020, 16:51 - Bee: I had some more mutton soup
25/01/2020, 16:51 - Bee: What are you doing?
25/01/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Playing Pokémon. You really like that mutton soup don't you
25/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: On your phone?
25/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Yes. There's no more
25/01/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/01/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Am I disturbing you
25/01/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Nope you aren't
25/01/2020, 17:02 - Bee: I'll continue no matter what your answer is :P
25/01/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: It's not like I'm being super productive about something
25/01/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Continue what?
25/01/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Disturbing you
25/01/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: But you aren't disturbing
25/01/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Am I disturbing you?
25/01/2020, 17:05 - Bee: Never
25/01/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Never is a long time 😮. You sure about that?
25/01/2020, 17:06 - Bee: 99% yes
25/01/2020, 17:06 - Bee: No
25/01/2020, 17:06 - Bee: 99.99999% yes
25/01/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Debby 🥺
25/01/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be helping out with Sunday school tomorrow?
25/01/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I don't think there's SS class tomorrow. A few are going to finalize things
25/01/2020, 17:19 - Bee: So I don't have to go
25/01/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. More rest for you then. Do you still feel sick at all?
25/01/2020, 17:24 - Bee: The cough got worse. There's no fever. The cold is manageable
25/01/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. I'm praying you get better. What time will you be sleeping?
25/01/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. :)
25/01/2020, 17:27 - Bee: I'm sleeping in 20. I'll take steam before I sleep
25/01/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Steam always helps me ☺. What'll you be doing for 20 min?
25/01/2020, 17:40 - Bee: I took steam for 10
25/01/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Now I'm just lying down
25/01/2020, 17:41 - Bee: What are you doing?
25/01/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Watching cooking videos... Trying to inspire myself to make more than just enough to fill my stomach 😅
25/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Did you settle on a recipe yet?
25/01/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: No.....
25/01/2020, 17:52 - Bee: What about chicken curry
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Or egg curry
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'll have to go buy chicken
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: OH!
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: ?
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: You have eggs
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I forgot you can make curry with eggs
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Bee: You can nana
25/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Got any recipe ideas? Or any type of prep
25/01/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Do you have Ginger and garlic?
25/01/2020, 17:57 - Bee: https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/punjabi-egg-curry-anda-curry-dhaba-style/
25/01/2020, 17:57 - Bee: She said we can just skip the steps with ingredients we don't have
25/01/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: I have garlic... I'll have to look around if ginger is there
25/01/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: I was on the same link 😂
25/01/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: It actually doesn't look too difficult
25/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.archanaskitchen.com/egg-curry-recipe/amp
25/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: This is easier!!
25/01/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Seems very doable... I don't have any of the hard spices but I'm just gonna skip over those
25/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: 😂
25/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Doesn't require any whole spices
25/01/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... I don't have coriander leaves but I'll skip over that as well :P
25/01/2020, 18:01 - Bee: So this one?
25/01/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Both look yum!
25/01/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yep the second one. I'll try the other one another day... If perchance I'm motivated enough to actually look for the spices
25/01/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby :)
25/01/2020, 18:03 - Bee: I just thought of egg fried rice too. I'm sure there's an easy recipe for that. Maybe next time
25/01/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe next time. I don't have cooked rice at the moment
25/01/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Okay
25/01/2020, 18:04 - Bee: I'll go to sleep
25/01/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)))))
25/01/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Goodnight Debby!! :)

25/01/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: And have a wonderful time of worship
25/01/2020, 18:04 - Bee: I hope so too
25/01/2020, 18:08 - Bee: *🐝
25/01/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Wha... I'm sorry I don't understand why this random insect has shown up
25/01/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight (absolutely no use of nicknames) Debby!
25/01/2020, 18:10 - Bee: But whyyyy
25/01/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Do you have a legit reason
25/01/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. I'm just doing it cause it annoys you
25/01/2020, 18:11 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/01/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
25/01/2020, 18:12 - Bee: You won't believe but that's my actual face rn
25/01/2020, 18:12 - Bee: ?
25/01/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm being terribly hypocritical saying no nicknames
25/01/2020, 18:12 - Bee: OH
25/01/2020, 18:12 - Bee: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: You won't believe but that's my actual face rn
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: At least it's not my full name anymore
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: It hasn't been for a while now :P
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you were going to sleep Debby!
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: I am
25/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Bye!
25/01/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Bye Bee
25/01/2020, 18:14 - Bee: With a smile on my face I wonder why
25/01/2020, 18:14 - Bee: There's a full stop after face
25/01/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Bye. :)
26/01/2020, 06:22 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
26/01/2020, 07:31 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! Hope you enjoy your restful day without Sunday school
26/01/2020, 08:00 - Bee: I was wrong. There's Sunday school on Bethany today. In Dharamveer Nagar it will start a couple weeks later. Looking forward to it :)
26/01/2020, 08:00 - Bee: I hope you have a great day!
26/01/2020, 14:31 - Bee: Hi Nischal
26/01/2020, 14:31 - Bee: How's your day going?
26/01/2020, 14:31 - Bee: Sunday school went well. Very few kids though. Which is expected because there was a long break
26/01/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: My days been good. Nikhil's plans for coming here are progressing
26/01/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: I just realised today that it's Republic Day today 😮. Maybe that's why there were fewer kids?
26/01/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: How was the gospel meeting?
26/01/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Oh! Are you excited? Will you take him sight seeing?
26/01/2020, 15:44 - Bee: He must be excited!!
26/01/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Maybe. Felt like a regular Sunday to me
26/01/2020, 15:45 - Bee: It was good. Many people responded. Wesley uncle shared the gospel
26/01/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Sort of. I don't know how excited/not excited he is really
26/01/2020, 15:47 - Bee: I started reading the Chronicles
26/01/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: From the Bible or of Narnia? 😂
26/01/2020, 15:51 - Bee: 😂
26/01/2020, 15:51 - Bee: Of Narnia
26/01/2020, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: Either way I think they're fun reads. Where'd you get the book from?
26/01/2020, 15:53 - Bee: The first two are available in Bethany. I got the third one from there. Got the first two ebooks illegally
26/01/2020, 15:54 - Bee: It has only a hundred something pages though
26/01/2020, 15:54 - Bee: Are they that small? Or am I missing pages
26/01/2020, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: The lion, the witch and the wardrobe?
26/01/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yep looks like around 150 pages
26/01/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: They're kids books Debby. Not novels
26/01/2020, 15:59 - Bee: Yes
26/01/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: Do you normally read a lot? I don't know if I've asked you this before
26/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: I expected a fat book
26/01/2020, 16:17 - Bee: I do. Just finished 20 pages. I think I'll finish the book before I go to sleep
26/01/2020, 16:17 - Bee: I stopped reading because there came a time I read only romance and they weren't good books. Graphic stuff and all. So I stopped
26/01/2020, 16:17 - Bee: I love reading
26/01/2020, 16:18 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. Fast reading... I tend to read so slowly it takes forever to finish a book
26/01/2020, 16:31 - Bee: Oh. I'm a quick reader
26/01/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy reading! Will you be going to the hospital tomorrow?
26/01/2020, 16:45 - Bee: Yes. I'm alright enough to go. Can't miss any more days
26/01/2020, 16:45 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
26/01/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'm good Debby. Meeting for Bible study tomorrow
26/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Pinterest
26/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Oh!!
26/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: When is Nikhil arriving?
26/01/2020, 17:01 - Bee: What are you doing?
26/01/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Probably 13th of Feb
26/01/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Are you talking to yourself Debby 😂
26/01/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: At the moment... Nothing
26/01/2020, 17:13 - Bee: No I'm talking to you
26/01/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Okay
26/01/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: But how can you be talking to me if I'm not replying?
26/01/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Hmm. I do not know
26/01/2020, 17:16 - Bee: I'm talking to future you
26/01/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Fair enough
26/01/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: You'll have to wait for future me to reply to that then
26/01/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Future you better have an answer 😂
26/01/2020, 17:20 - Bee: But it's not fair of me to ask you
26/01/2020, 17:21 - Bee: So present you or future you need not have an answer
26/01/2020, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: You could call me anything you want and I'll accept it. Isn't a nickname meant to be made by others? If people got to choose then I doubt people in school would be called what they are
26/01/2020, 17:25 - Bee: It is
26/01/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Hence
26/01/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. I think Nischal is a wonderful nickname
26/01/2020, 17:31 - Bee: What happened to people not getting to choose their nicknames
26/01/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Well you can take it or leave it. I'm just saying what I think
26/01/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Okay Nischal
26/01/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: So Nischal it is?
26/01/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: I mean you don't have to decide immediately. It can just come up over time
26/01/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe I end up doing something silly (very likely) which leads to a fun/embarrassing nickname
26/01/2020, 17:49 - Bee: 😂
26/01/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Until further notice.
26/01/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Cool ☺. So what're you up to? Is it bedtime?
26/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I'm reading the book. Less than half remaining. Bedtime in 10. I'll read until then. Not finishing it today
26/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I want to ask you something
26/01/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing!
26/01/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: You mean right now or later?
26/01/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: I think I took a week when I first read it 😅
26/01/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I think later. A phone call would be better
26/01/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I'll make a note of it
26/01/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Can I just ask you now? I'll explain the background when we talk.
26/01/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Of course
26/01/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Did I cross a line when I sent you a letter?
26/01/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
26/01/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Okay
26/01/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Thank you
26/01/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: No problem. I'm gonna try hard not to overthink this and just wait till our next conversation 😂
26/01/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Oh no. Please try not to.
26/01/2020, 18:12 - Bee: It's not important.
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But I'm glad you asked anyway
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: I am too
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: I should go to sleep now
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Okay Debs. I hope you have a great day tomorrow! And I pray your sickness is gone too
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Thank you
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Bee: :)
26/01/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! 😊
27/01/2020, 07:47 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
27/01/2020, 07:48 - Bee: I didn't go today. There's a little chest congestion. Told to stay home
27/01/2020, 09:19 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
27/01/2020, 09:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Are you okay? Does it hurt?
27/01/2020, 09:33 - Bee: Only when I cough
27/01/2020, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: That's a strange time to be okay. I guess it does clear your throat
27/01/2020, 09:38 - Bee: 😂
27/01/2020, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: What do you plan to do all day then?
27/01/2020, 09:38 - Bee: I meant it hurts only when I cough
27/01/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Pretty much nothing. There's an assignment I have to work on. I'll finish that before I sleep
27/01/2020, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: You going to sleep now?
27/01/2020, 09:40 - Bee: No.. I woke up at 10. No afternoon nap for me
27/01/2020, 09:41 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough. You've been getting a lot of sleep in these last few days haven't you... How does it feel?
27/01/2020, 10:00 - Bee: Terrible. I feel like I wasted so much time
27/01/2020, 10:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yea waking up at 10 makes me feel the same
27/01/2020, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Somehow I don't mind going to bed early as long as I'm getting up on time. Then again I am a morning person so...
27/01/2020, 10:22 - Bee: I'm a morning person when there's no choice
27/01/2020, 10:23 - Bee: What's your day like today?
27/01/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Going for Bible study in the evening. Planning on making the pulao today
27/01/2020, 10:28 - Bee: The chicken kheema one?
27/01/2020, 10:28 - Bee: Your have chicken kheema?
27/01/2020, 10:28 - Bee: What time will you leave for the Bible study?
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I'll be improvising 😂. Gonna use beef?
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Bee: So many questions
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Even better!!!
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Yum
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Evening. Maybe leave home at 6
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Oh
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Depends on how it turns out 😂
27/01/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Free to talk before that?
27/01/2020, 10:30 - Bee: Beef can't go wrong
27/01/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: I've already messed it up twice now
27/01/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely 😊. What time?
27/01/2020, 10:34 - Bee: 😯 how?
27/01/2020, 10:34 - Bee: Your 1:30?
27/01/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good
27/01/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Overcooked. I mean it's edible but it was rubbery
27/01/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: And tough
27/01/2020, 10:36 - Bee: Ahhh. I've never tried cooking beef. I wouldn't know
27/01/2020, 10:36 - Bee: I'll work on my assignment for a while
27/01/2020, 10:36 - Bee: Hope the pulao turns out edible
27/01/2020, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: Me too 😁
27/01/2020, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: Talk later!
27/01/2020, 11:26 - Nischal Abraham: Question. In the recipe is the rice supposed to be cooked already?
27/01/2020, 12:44 - Bee: Nischalll
27/01/2020, 12:44 - Bee: I turned off my internet
27/01/2020, 12:44 - Bee: How was the pulao?
27/01/2020, 12:45 - Bee: Yes... 😶
27/01/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Ah I was too lazy to go buy the beef so I made what I had for lunch
27/01/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Omlette with mushrooms onions and tomato
27/01/2020, 13:05 - Bee: What did you do with the beef you had?!
27/01/2020, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't have any beef. I'd have to go buy it
27/01/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Oh you were talking about a precious cooking endeavor
27/01/2020, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Previous yes. A while back with noodles
27/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Ahhh
27/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: I'm waiting for my red velvet waffle to arrive.
27/01/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Ordered?
27/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: I should stop watching cake deco videos
27/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Yes. 🤦🏻‍♀
27/01/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Really stop
27/01/2020, 13:11 - Bee: But that's all over my explore page
27/01/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Btw I'm free to talk whenever you are. Done with lunch

28/01/2020, 12:46 - Bee: I am well eny
28/01/2020, 12:46 - Bee: Just got back from the hospital
28/01/2020, 12:46 - Bee: How's your day going!
28/01/2020, 12:46 - Bee: ?*
28/01/2020, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm well too. Just finished with lunch
28/01/2020, 13:17 - Bee: What was for lunch?
28/01/2020, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: Rice and stuff
28/01/2020, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: What about you?
28/01/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Chapatis and a vegetable which I don't know the name of in English
28/01/2020, 14:14 - Bee: But it is tendli in konkani
28/01/2020, 14:14 - Bee: I'll look for a photo
28/01/2020, 14:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/01/2020, 14:15 - Bee: How was rock climbing and the Bible study?
28/01/2020, 14:15 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. Couldn't climb as well as I'd like. Bible study was good though so that's nice
28/01/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Still on your way home?
28/01/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Nope. I reached around 6:20
28/01/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Got a quick bus train and then bus again
28/01/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. I spoke for so long on the phone yesterday! 😮
28/01/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: After you, my parents called and I was on the line with them for 40 min
28/01/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Then I was talking to Nidhi for an hour or more
28/01/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Then I got late for my climbing 😂
28/01/2020, 14:46 - Bee: Woah what has happened to you Nischal 😂
28/01/2020, 14:46 - Bee: That's 4 hours 40 min+ on the phone
28/01/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Maybe that's why I couldn't climb properly
28/01/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Why yes...can't think of any other reason
28/01/2020, 15:05 - Bee: I'm feeling much much better today
28/01/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Thank you for all your prayers, Nischal.
28/01/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God! So happy to hear it 😁
28/01/2020, 16:05 - Bee: What are you doing?
28/01/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: I was going through old photos on my hard drive
28/01/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: What about you?
28/01/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Was working on my assignment. Took a break now. Don't know how long this break will last
28/01/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: Is it meant to be a short break?
28/01/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: Is it your dinner break?
28/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: No I had dinner already
28/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: I just remembered that I need a copy of the medical certificate which I have to submit tomorrow 🤦🏻‍♀
28/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: On my way to take a Xerox copy now
28/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: This is my break
28/01/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a nice break. A walk outside is a good context change I'd say
28/01/2020, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have a lot of the assignment still to go?
28/01/2020, 16:24 - Bee: Kinda yes. I can finish it if I work on it for two hours straight which I plan on doing once I'm back home
28/01/2020, 16:24 - Bee: It is!! Cold empty and pleasant
28/01/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Planning on staying up?
28/01/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wait. Its only 10 now... I thought it was much later
28/01/2020, 16:29 - Bee: Not even 10. Still got a min to go :P
28/01/2020, 16:29 - Bee: But yes I'll stay up until I finish
28/01/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. All the best for that :). I'll be awake if it gets too much for you and you need to chat
28/01/2020, 16:59 - Bee: ☺
28/01/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Halfway done. Don't feel like doing the rest now 😔
28/01/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Good job keeping at it this long 😮
28/01/2020, 17:49 - Bee: I'm thinking of trying to wake up early and do it but I don't know how that will work out
28/01/2020, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: What time do you have to leave?
28/01/2020, 17:50 - Bee: 6:15
28/01/2020, 17:51 - Bee: I'll ask Jason to wake me up when he comes
28/01/2020, 17:51 - Bee: And go to sleep now
28/01/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. Do you have to submit it tomorrow?
28/01/2020, 17:57 - Bee: I don't have to. I know I'll be excused since I was sick. But I want to
28/01/2020, 17:58 - Bee: It's alright. If I'm able to wake up I'll finish it. If not then I'll find time to do it there
28/01/2020, 17:58 - Bee: I'll go to sleep anyway
28/01/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough 😊
28/01/2020, 17:58 - Bee: What are you doing?
28/01/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Listing down things to buy for today's dinner. I'm starting really small and slow.
28/01/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Cause everyday I keep telling myself I'll make the pulao and its not happening
28/01/2020, 17:59 - Bee: What are you planning on cooking then?
28/01/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: But there's a simple fried rice recipe I found for which I already have the ingredients
28/01/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Just need cabbage I think. So I'll go get that
28/01/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Oh
28/01/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I shall asleep
28/01/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Sleep*
28/01/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. ☺
28/01/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Okay Debby. You rest up! I hope you are able to finish the work you need to
28/01/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
28/01/2020, 18:01 - Bee: I hope so too
28/01/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Bye!
28/01/2020, 23:35 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
28/01/2020, 23:37 - Nischal Abraham: Veg fried rice. It actually tasted good 😁. I'm glad I did something today.
I hope you managed to get up. Have a great day Debby!
29/01/2020, 06:18 - Bee: It looks goood!
29/01/2020, 06:18 - Bee: I didn't wake up early. I think it's impossible for me. I should just finish everything before I go to sleep
29/01/2020, 06:18 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. ☺
29/01/2020, 06:18 - Bee: You have a great day too!
29/01/2020, 12:58 - Bee: The time you laughed the hardest in 2019?
29/01/2020, 12:58 - Bee: If you remember
29/01/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: I don't really... I don't think I remember the time I've laughed the hardest in all my life. I know its there somewhere... Just don't remember it
29/01/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: What about you?
29/01/2020, 13:06 - Bee: I don't remember the time I laughed the hardest. I laughed a lot during the Delhi trip (I remember the RND singing along to Love is an open door very clearly). And the family camp (Shibi aunty was sharing stories about her mum in law. I'll share the one I remember the next time we talk).
29/01/2020, 13:07 - Bee: And lunches with Abisha and Tijy (the two closest friends in college). We're usually posted in different areas and meet only for lunch which is always fun
29/01/2020, 13:08 - Bee: OH and the Valentine's day spent with Ben and Sahil. I laughed A LOT. That I remember
29/01/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like wonderful memories!! I don't know why I'm drawing a blank right now 🤔
29/01/2020, 13:09 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/01/2020, 13:09 - Bee: Maybe because I'm asking you
29/01/2020, 13:09 - Bee: That happens
29/01/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! That looks cool!! Was it your phone?
29/01/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Sahils. The most expensive one among ours!!
29/01/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. Well it led to good photos
29/01/2020, 13:36 - Bee: Yes 😂
29/01/2020, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Home yet? How was your day?
29/01/2020, 14:44 - Bee: Yes I reached around 7
29/01/2020, 14:45 - Bee: My day went well :) I was posted in the OPD. So there's this machine there which has a probe like a sonography's probe but is meant for listening to the heartbeat of the baby
29/01/2020, 14:45 - Bee: So I was doing that the whole day. And some mums got all emotional which was wow.
29/01/2020, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds beautiful. I attempted my first egg curry
29/01/2020, 15:08 - Bee: And?
29/01/2020, 15:08 - Bee: How is it?
29/01/2020, 15:09 - Bee: Send a photo!
29/01/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: I just realised you can't even see the eggs 😂
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Bee: Ohh this is the tomato onion one
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Bee: How does it taste?
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. For all the stuff I put in it, it didn't have a lot of taste
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Bee: Well done, Nischal! :)
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Bee: Oh
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Bee: You need chicken cubes 😂
29/01/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe my proportions are wrong
29/01/2020, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: In egg curry?
29/01/2020, 15:21 - Bee: I think it goes with everything
29/01/2020, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'll need to buy chicken for that
29/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: No no those chicken stock cubes
29/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: My bad. I wasn't clear
29/01/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Those Maggi cubes?
29/01/2020, 15:27 - Bee: Thank you for not questioning my sanity 😂
29/01/2020, 15:27 - Bee: ..
29/01/2020, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: OH! Okay yea I know those
29/01/2020, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yea instead of just water I could add that. Probably would add to the flavour
29/01/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: The problem with most things I make is that they smell really good and end up tasting rather bland 😂
29/01/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Not too sure but I think it's cause there wasn't enough ginger and salt. Also I skimped on the garam masala cause I couldn't find it... Which may be the actual reason
29/01/2020, 15:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/01/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Sorry couldn't help myself
29/01/2020, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha... I'm perfecting them for the Irish tastebuds 🤣
29/01/2020, 15:45 - Bee: 😂
29/01/2020, 15:45 - Bee: Cherise and the gang would love it
29/01/2020, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: YEA! I completely forgot that's a thing. I've got two dishes under my belt to contribute now 😁
29/01/2020, 15:47 - Bee: And raita!!
29/01/2020, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Don't know how to make raita
29/01/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Just curd and cucumber and salt and a little water and onions if you want
29/01/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh the basic raita. Yea I could manage that. For some reason in my head I was thinking of boondi raita
29/01/2020, 15:50 - Bee: Do you get boondi there?
29/01/2020, 15:50 - Bee: :O
29/01/2020, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: Idk. Maybe not. I also don't know why it came into my head
29/01/2020, 15:53 - Bee: Do you like boondi raita?
29/01/2020, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: Every instance I've eaten it has been good
29/01/2020, 15:54 - Bee: What's up?
29/01/2020, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: Noting down ideas for next new dish I can try out tomorrow
29/01/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: How about you? Working on the assignment?
29/01/2020, 16:07 - Bee: What have you come up with?
29/01/2020, 16:07 - Bee: Finished dinner. I'll go to sleep early
29/01/2020, 16:07 - Bee: Can I call you to say hi?
29/01/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Oh sorry bad phrasing. I meant looking for a dish I can make
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Ahhh
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yes please! When?
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Now?
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Or whenever you're free
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: 5 min?
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Until my 10
29/01/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Yes yes
29/01/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: As in give me 5 min. I'll just head upstairs
29/01/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: Cool I'm free
29/01/2020, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: I should've said 1 min
29/01/2020, 16:10 - Bee: Got it
29/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: I'll call
29/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: ?
29/01/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nice sweet short half an hour call
29/01/2020, 16:54 - Bee: You are nice and sweet
29/01/2020, 16:54 - Bee: ohhhhh I wanted to ask you something 🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
29/01/2020, 16:54 - Bee: I forgot
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Tomorrow
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: For next time?
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Yes
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Sure 😊
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'll note it down
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Okay
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Good because I'll forget
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Key word : questions
29/01/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal! :)
29/01/2020, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Praying for your tomorrow ☺
30/01/2020, 07:30 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal ☺
30/01/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Half the exam is over. It went really well. I got a very cooperative family
30/01/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Waiting for the viva part of it now
30/01/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Hope your day goes well
30/01/2020, 07:31 - Bee: And that you cook something new.
30/01/2020, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! So glad to hear your exam's going well
30/01/2020, 09:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'll definitely try
30/01/2020, 11:26 - Bee: Nischallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
30/01/2020, 11:26 - Bee: The viva was okay
30/01/2020, 11:26 - Bee: I'm glad it's over
30/01/2020, 11:26 - Bee: Hows your day going?
30/01/2020, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: My day's okay. Woke up at 9:30 and realised next week I won't be able to do this anymore
30/01/2020, 12:32 - Bee: 3 days to reboot?
30/01/2020, 12:32 - Bee: What did you cook?
30/01/2020, 12:32 - Bee: Are you looking forward to college?
30/01/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea
30/01/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing yet
30/01/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yes and no
30/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Okay
30/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: What're you up to?
30/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Lunch?
30/01/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Have you eaten?
30/01/2020, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: Going to the kitchen now. What about you?
30/01/2020, 13:17 - Bee: Just got home. I'll eat an orange now
30/01/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh... Healthy snack alternative?
30/01/2020, 13:31 - Bee: Yes. I'm enjoying oranges. With salt and chilli powder
30/01/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good. I tried making cabbage thoran... I think I didn't slice the cabbage thin enough
30/01/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Scratch that. I definitely didn't slice the cabbage thin enough
30/01/2020, 14:46 - Bee: How does it taste?
30/01/2020, 14:47 - Bee: I think it's a success as long as it's cooked well. Is it the mustard seed recipe?
30/01/2020, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: It does have mustard seed. I think it needs to be done a bit more than I have
30/01/2020, 15:20 - Bee: Oh. Ate it with rice?
30/01/2020, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Rice, yogurt and pickle
30/01/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Now for the first time I have leftovers for 2 dishes in my fridge 😂
30/01/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Feels good
30/01/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Wow Nischal.
30/01/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Productive day and you still have so many hours to go!!
30/01/2020, 15:40 - Bee: ☺
30/01/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. Well my meeting with guide got postponed to tomorrow
30/01/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm going climbing with Rufus, Matthew and Abigail
30/01/2020, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: They're all from CU
30/01/2020, 16:13 - Bee: Sounds fun. And tiring. But fun
30/01/2020, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: Are you tired?
30/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: Yes. Carrying that bag is a lot of work
30/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: Finished dinner. I'll go to bed early tonight
30/01/2020, 16:16 - Bee: When do you leave for rock climbing?
30/01/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: In the bus now. When will you go to sleep?
30/01/2020, 16:18 - Bee: 10:30
30/01/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably reach the gym before then
30/01/2020, 16:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/01/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
30/01/2020, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep is such a luxury. I can't believe I never thought this way when I was in school
30/01/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: So is tomorrow a relatively lighter day? Since you're in college
30/01/2020, 16:26 - Bee: Ikr?! I fought naps as a child. So stupid
30/01/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Yes. The afternoon is for research stuff so I'll just be sitting in one place in working
30/01/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Looking forward to tomorrow
30/01/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! ☺. So what are you doing till bedtime?
30/01/2020, 16:32 - Bee: Nothing at all. Ashley is having dinner
30/01/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Waiting for him to finish
30/01/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
30/01/2020, 16:35 - Bee: There was dry-fish curry with mixed vegetables and rice
30/01/2020, 16:35 - Bee: It was my favorite dry fish
30/01/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Wow... I'm really missing fish with how often you're having it 😂

03/02/2020, 11:13 - Bee: Hey
03/02/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: How'd it go?
03/02/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Better than I thought it would go. I think I'll pass. Which is enough for me
03/02/2020, 12:54 - Bee: How's your day college? How is it being back?
03/02/2020, 12:54 - Bee: How's the new subject?!
03/02/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Going*
03/02/2020, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: The new professor is really good. It's a lot of Math so far but all that I understand so it's going well
03/02/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Still just the first day so we'll see how it goes
03/02/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's good
03/02/2020, 14:37 - Bee: I hope you say the same after a week of the just one subject
03/02/2020, 14:37 - Bee: Of just one subject*
03/02/2020, 14:37 - Bee: Are your timings the same?
03/02/2020, 16:36 - Bee: I'm exhausted... Going to bed
03/02/2020, 16:36 - Bee: I hope you had a great day, Nischal :)
03/02/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
03/02/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Worse if today is an indicator. It's proper 9:30 to 5:30
03/02/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I'm sorry we couldn't talk today. I hope your day goes well tomorrow too
04/02/2020, 02:39 - Bee: Hey. It's okay 😊
04/02/2020, 02:39 - Bee: Good morning. ☺
04/02/2020, 08:20 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! 😁. "Shadow of the Almighty" has been such a blessing to me. It's surprisingly not the kind of book I was expecting it to be
04/02/2020, 11:17 - Bee: Is it everything about Jim Elliot?
04/02/2020, 11:18 - Bee: Missionary stories are my favorite. I grew up reading them. I should start reading one too
04/02/2020, 11:18 - Bee: Did you finish the book?
04/02/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. It's his biography so I guess that's all that's covered in the book. I don't recall ever reading a full biography before
04/02/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: Not yet. Halfway through. I'm a terribly slow reader 😅
04/02/2020, 11:26 - Bee: A statement/quote/event/anything that stood out to you?
04/02/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Oh. I read a biography of Jim Elliot by Elisabeth Elliot called 'Through gates of splendor'. I wonder if this is different from the one you're reading
04/02/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Whenever you have time
04/02/2020, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea. I think that book is about the people that Jim Elliot went to evangelize to. 
The book I'm reading is about his life story
04/02/2020, 13:42 - Bee: OH. You've read that one too?
04/02/2020, 14:56 - Nischal Abraham: Nope haven't read it. I just checked out the wiki right now
04/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: Oh
04/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: I'm gonna start a book on George Muller
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Bedtime for me. Going to sleep early.. had a busy day today
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: I hope your day is going well, Nischal
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Hey!!
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished with lecture
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Finished early today?
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Ahh
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Good for you 😃
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: They sounds good
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Heading back home?
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: That*
04/02/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Yesss
04/02/2020, 16:34 - Bee: I have a copy at home
04/02/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: I will in some time. He literally just left
04/02/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Oh
04/02/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Bus? Walk? Cycle?
04/02/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Rest well Debby. Don't stay up on my account :(
04/02/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Bus
04/02/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Okay
04/02/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Hope it was a good day though!
04/02/2020, 16:35 - Bee: If I sleep in a few I'll get more than 6 hours of sleep 🤩
04/02/2020, 16:35 - Bee: It was
04/02/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: 😊😊
04/02/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Came back home on time today
04/02/2020, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep is nice. I'm trying to make sure I keep up 6 hours of sleep as well
04/02/2020, 16:36 - Bee: How has your day been so far?
04/02/2020, 16:36 - Bee: You must be heading out now
04/02/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Tell me later!
04/02/2020, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: It's been good. Done with lecture so now it's just heading home and working on other stuff
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Project stuff?
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Bee: The Thursday meet
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Not yet. In 10 min. Just chilling in the lab for a while
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Is there Bible study this week?
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Oh
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that needs to be done 😢
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep on Thursday. But it's just me and Daniel this week
04/02/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Family hour was good! I'll tell you about it when we talk. I forgot to mention it because of the exam
04/02/2020, 16:38 - Bee: Oh
04/02/2020, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. Nidhi told me some about it
04/02/2020, 16:38 - Bee: Okay
04/02/2020, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: I've been talking to her a lot more recently. She seems to be struggling with things too
04/02/2020, 16:39 - Bee: I don't know what you're talking about but she did share some during the sleepover
04/02/2020, 16:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well I guess everyone's struggling. But it's nice to talk openly with my siblings. Hopefully someday Nikhil and my conversations would be that open 😂😂
04/02/2020, 16:39 - Bee: It's nice that you're getting to talk more. She misses you
04/02/2020, 16:39 - Bee: 😂 in less than two weeks for all you know
04/02/2020, 16:40 - Nischal Abraham: I still need to decide on the card stuff
04/02/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: There's so much to do and such s temptation to just give up on all effort
04/02/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: I've just been praying I don't stay down for longer than is absolutely unavoidable
04/02/2020, 16:42 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for keeping you up. Hope we get to talk soon 😊
04/02/2020, 16:42 - Nischal Abraham: Have an amazing day tomorrow!!
04/02/2020, 16:47 - Bee: What kinda card do you want to make? I forgot. Was it a birthday card?
04/02/2020, 16:47 - Bee: I prayed and will be praying too Nischal
04/02/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Please don't be sorry. You didn't keep me up
04/02/2020, 16:48 - Bee: I miss you
04/02/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Bye

05/02/2020, 08:11 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal
05/02/2020, 08:11 - Bee: May day has been good so far
05/02/2020, 08:11 - Bee: I hope your day is productive
05/02/2020, 08:12 - Bee: ☺
05/02/2020, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
05/02/2020, 08:22 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear you're having a good day. It's always my hope that my day ends up productive
05/02/2020, 08:23 - Nischal Abraham: Today is the first CU for the sem! Excited to meet everyone... Though I've been bumping into them all through last month so it won't be like it's been a long time
05/02/2020, 08:37 - Bee: Yay! What's the topic for today?
05/02/2020, 08:37 - Bee: If you bump into Rufus, tell him I say hi
05/02/2020, 08:37 - Bee: Thanks
05/02/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: I don't remember. But Cherise is sharing her testimony today
05/02/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Did you reply to his friend request finally?
05/02/2020, 11:13 - Bee: I did
05/02/2020, 11:14 - Bee: On my way back home. I have an assignment to complete today
05/02/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun with the assignment :). I'm starting to enjoy this subject
05/02/2020, 12:55 - Bee: I will try to. You have fun with your possibly new favorite subject (??) and CU ☺
06/02/2020, 13:21 - Bee: Hey!
06/02/2020, 13:23 - Bee: I'm sorry we couldn't talk
06/02/2020, 13:24 - Bee: It was a busy day. Just left from college
06/02/2020, 13:25 - Bee: How's your day going?
06/02/2020, 13:25 - Bee: Are you meeting with your professor today?
06/02/2020, 13:25 - Bee: How was yesterday's CU?
06/02/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: You and me both
06/02/2020, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: Busy for me too. Lectures this year are so much more hectic. But I'm enjoying them too so it's not too bad
06/02/2020, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I wish I had something to show for the two weeks of not meeting him. I'm disheartened by myself :/
06/02/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. Very short but I guess that's cause it was the first day of the new sem
06/02/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: How has college been? Did you go to the hospital as well today?
07/02/2020, 01:08 - Bee: Nischal
07/02/2020, 01:09 - Bee: I went to sleep around 8:30 last night
I have my seminar today The one which was postponed two months ago. Woke up early to prepare for that
07/02/2020, 01:11 - Bee: I'm very sorry. :(
07/02/2020, 01:11 - Bee: It was a busy day. Went to the hospital in the morning and then college in the afternoon for research
07/02/2020, 01:22 - Bee: Again, I'm sorry, Nischal
07/02/2020, 08:37 - Nischal Abraham: I don't see why you have to be sorry for that. If anything I feel bad that I've been too busy to message you at all.
I guess we're both just really busy people right now and I think that's okay :).
Praying for your seminar! I don't know if you're already done with it by the time you read this but I'm confident God isn't bound by my timezone. I pray your day goes well.
And again, please don't apologize for not being able to reply. We'll just have to appreciate all the time we do get to talk a lot more
07/02/2020, 08:37 - Nischal Abraham: And sorry for the long message 😅
07/02/2020, 12:04 - Bee: Thank you for praying. :) My seminar went really well. I got a good score
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Bee: But I could've messaged. I made poor choices. The only good that came out was me getting 8 hours of sleep
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Bee: I love long messages
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Bee: And short messages
07/02/2020, 12:05 - Bee: All messages. From you.
07/02/2020, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!! Good going on the seminar 😁
07/02/2020, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Done with lecture for today. Now I'm hoping I can keep up my momentum through the weekend
07/02/2020, 16:53 - Bee: Oh
07/02/2020, 16:53 - Bee: Rock climbing today?
07/02/2020, 16:54 - Bee: I'm in college tomorrow as well. So an extra hour of sleep
07/02/2020, 16:54 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
07/02/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your sleep! No rock climbing today. I went yesterday and may have pulled a muscle on my arm which hurts
07/02/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Also no one's going rock climbing today. So it's straight home for me... After shopping for some stuff
08/02/2020, 02:26 - Bee: Nischallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
08/02/2020, 02:26 - Bee: Good morning. ☺
08/02/2020, 02:26 - Bee: I always made fun of people who send good morning/night messages
08/02/2020, 02:27 - Bee: 😂
08/02/2020, 02:27 - Bee: What's your plan for today?
08/02/2020, 02:27 - Bee: How did the meet with your professor go? The Thursday one
08/02/2020, 02:28 - Bee: It's a quiet day for me in college today. No lectures. Only research stuff. And my group is the only one done with the pilot study. Makes me happy. (Not the fact that the others are behind but they were getting work done)
08/02/2020, 02:29 - Bee: And I'm babysitting Christopher and Ella on Monday! ☺ I'm looking forward to it
08/02/2020, 02:30 - Bee: Jason and I hung out with Reenee yesterday evening. Jason had taken leave because he has an exam today. We ate a lot of street food and ended it with coke. And we also bumped into Lydia
08/02/2020, 02:30 - Bee: I once dropped Lydia when she was an infant
08/02/2020, 02:31 - Bee: But she's turned out fine..
08/02/2020, 02:31 - Bee: I'll tell you about it when we talk
08/02/2020, 02:31 - Bee: It is Manaswi's birthday tomorrow. Do you remember Manaswi?
08/02/2020, 02:33 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
08/02/2020, 02:35 - Bee: It feels like I haven't spoken to you in a long time. Which is true. That's why so many messages. My bad
08/02/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! It has been a while since we've spoken. Let me know if you're free today?
08/02/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be calling home too but I'm at home all day today so I can plan something out 😁
08/02/2020, 10:02 - Nischal Abraham: And when we do get to talk I'll give my reply to all your messages... Unless you really really want to message you the reply which fair enough I could do.  It's up to you really
08/02/2020, 12:03 - Bee: Hey
08/02/2020, 12:03 - Bee: Just left from college. I am free today. I'll let you know once I reach home
08/02/2020, 12:04 - Bee: You can reply when we talk
08/02/2020, 12:04 - Bee: :)
08/02/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Cool!
08/02/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it :)
08/02/2020, 12:39 - Bee: 😊
08/02/2020, 13:17 - Bee: Hey
08/02/2020, 13:17 - Bee: I'm home! And free to talk whenever you are
08/02/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice! I'll call after lunch okay? So in another 40 min?
08/02/2020, 13:21 - Bee: Yes yes. Take your time
08/02/2020, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take a while longer. Just heated my food. I'll message when I'm done
08/02/2020, 13:59 - Bee: Okay. I'll be here whenever you're done :)
08/02/2020, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
08/02/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Hey
08/02/2020, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free now
08/02/2020, 14:39 - Bee: I'm free too
08/02/2020, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
08/02/2020, 14:40 - Bee: Yes
08/02/2020, 17:39 - Bee: PRIYA AND JASON WENT FOR A MOVIE
08/02/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice
08/02/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Was it animated?
08/02/2020, 17:40 - Bee: A MOVIE
08/02/2020, 17:40 - Bee: No
08/02/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Is it surprising for Jason to be watching movies?
08/02/2020, 17:41 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/02/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Is it?
08/02/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: You wanted to go with them?
08/02/2020, 17:43 - Bee: Not the first time they went for a movie without me
08/02/2020, 17:44 - Bee: Not really
08/02/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Then I don't see why it's a big deal
08/02/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: You could always take Ashley for a movie
08/02/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Yes. But Ashley isn't interested in animated movies
08/02/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: But it wasn't animated
08/02/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh! Take Nidhi with you. She'd love to join (if she has time)
08/02/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Yes. Nidhi. Waiting for the next animated movie to come out now
08/02/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: What was for dinner? And isn't it bedtime?
08/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Dal, beetroot vegetable, and rice
08/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: It is bedtime
08/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: I'm in my bed. Jason just came in saying he watched a movie and I wanted to tell you
08/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Now I'll go to sleep
08/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Thank you. For being understanding.
08/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
08/02/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby 😊. It was fun talking to you
09/02/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
09/02/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Have a great day!
09/02/2020, 09:31 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby! I hope you have a great day yourself
09/02/2020, 10:06 - Bee: Thank you
09/02/2020, 10:06 - Bee: On my way to Dharamveer nagar
09/02/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Hey!! The children's club at Dharamveer Nagar went well. ☺
09/02/2020, 13:15 - Bee: I have two computer doubts Nischal
09/02/2020, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: That's great news! Thanking God 😊
09/02/2020, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: Ask away
09/02/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I received a laptop as a gift! And it has the Microsoft office trial...not the complete one. Is there a way to download the application for free?
09/02/2020, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: I think there's a student version you can get of Microsoft. I'll search on it tonight and let you know
10/02/2020, 01:12 - Bee: Thank you
10/02/2020, 01:12 - Bee: And good morning, Nischalllllllllllllllllllll. ☺
10/02/2020, 01:12 - Bee: New week! And new subjects for you!!
10/02/2020, 01:13 - Bee: I hope you have a gooood day. :)
10/02/2020, 04:32 - Bee: How did your yesterday go?
10/02/2020, 07:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I'm excited for my new subjects 😁
10/02/2020, 07:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yesterday was a good day. I'll explain in detail when we talk but the short of it is I was invited by Jim and Jean for lunch and had wonderful conversation
10/02/2020, 07:10 - Bee: I'm glad!
10/02/2020, 07:10 - Bee: Okay. I'll make a note. :)
10/02/2020, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
10/02/2020, 14:09 - Bee: HEYYYYY
10/02/2020, 14:09 - Bee: IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU
10/02/2020, 14:09 - Bee: Back home already?!
10/02/2020, 14:09 - Bee: Snowfall!!!!!!
10/02/2020, 14:09 - Bee: Are you excited?
10/02/2020, 14:09 - Bee: Do you like snowfall?
10/02/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't have lecture today. Sorry for the delay I was talking to parents
10/02/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: It was interesting. It lasted all of 15 min and then turned sunny 😂
10/02/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
10/02/2020, 18:09 - Bee: 😂 no Narnia-like scene anytime soon then. Or ever
10/02/2020, 18:11 - Bee: My day was good. I had college today. And I spent some time with Christopher and Eliana in the evening. Christopher taught me a new game. And no matter how I played, I always lost because of the ever changing rules 😂
10/02/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Dinner was at Siby Aunty's. Had a lovely time there. Received some much needed encouragement
10/02/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Also, I drove to and fro. And there were other cars on the road. It wasn't too bad. Ashley seemed impressed
10/02/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Postings from tomorrow
10/02/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Back to waking up when everyone else is still sleeping.
10/02/2020, 18:13 - Bee: How was your day?
10/02/2020, 18:38 - Bee: I'm gonna go to sleep... Goodnight, Nischal. :)
10/02/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Hope your day is going well
10/02/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: I hope not. I don't think that's a fun environment to be in. Unless you mean the summer time where everything turns green
10/02/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: Sound like a fun game I need to learn 😂
10/02/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! Does Ashley drive?
10/02/2020, 22:13 - Nischal Abraham: I was sleeping when you sent all these messages. Did I tell you my lecture was cancelled today? I don't have one tomorrow either. Now it's straightaway on Wednesday
10/02/2020, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: But that just means I have a lot of work to be done while I'm home
10/02/2020, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you read this. I hope your day is filled with learning and blessing tomorrow
11/02/2020, 02:35 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. ☺
11/02/2020, 02:35 - Bee: Nope
11/02/2020, 02:36 - Bee: Ahh. Do you still have to go to college? Or can you work at home
11/02/2020, 02:37 - Bee: Thank you. :)
11/02/2020, 09:09 - Nischal Abraham: I can "work" from home. The hardest thing I've found to do
11/02/2020, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: And good afternoon Debby! I hope your day's going well
11/02/2020, 11:33 - Bee: How's it going?
11/02/2020, 12:08 - Bee: Random thought. 
Thank you for being you. God is my only source of joy and you are a major medium through which I receive it. Thanking God for you.
Done. 
Bye!
11/02/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Better than I thought. But not enough. Took me an hour to go through just 1 paper 😶
11/02/2020, 12:19 - Bee: That's progress. You can do it Nischal
11/02/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so. My goal for today is just 2 papers before 2pm
11/02/2020, 14:03 - Bee: And?
11/02/2020, 14:03 - Bee: What about lunch?
11/02/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Done
11/02/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: With lunch. And 1 and a half paper
11/02/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Oh cool
11/02/2020, 14:19 - Nischal Abraham: It is!! It's so much better than 0 😂
11/02/2020, 14:48 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been?
11/02/2020, 17:06 - Bee: My day was good. Tiring but good. I slept for a while. I have an assignment to complete
11/02/2020, 20:37 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good. I'm in for a busy few days coming up
11/02/2020, 22:28 - Bee: Oh.. assignments?
11/02/2020, 22:51 - Nischal Abraham: Not just that. So tomorrow there'll be CU. Then Thursday the Bible study meet. Then God willing Friday Nikhil will be here for the weekend
11/02/2020, 23:13 - Bee: OH!! Nikhil!!
11/02/2020, 23:13 - Bee: Does he leave on Sunday?
11/02/2020, 23:13 - Nischal Abraham: Monday. How come you're still awake?
11/02/2020, 23:14 - Bee: Bedtime for you?
11/02/2020, 23:14 - Bee: ..
11/02/2020, 23:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'll be heading to bed in 10 min
11/02/2020, 23:13 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... How's it going?
11/02/2020, 23:14 - Bee: Halfway done. I'll do the rest in college
11/02/2020, 23:14 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
11/02/2020, 23:15 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby. Really been missing you
11/02/2020, 23:15 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have a great day today 😊
11/02/2020, 23:16 - Bee: Im missing you too Nischal. So much.
11/02/2020, 23:16 - Bee: Thank you. :)
12/02/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Nischal
12/02/2020, 11:27 - Bee: How's your day going?
12/02/2020, 11:27 - Bee: What's for lunch?
12/02/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Tried any new recipes lately?
12/02/2020, 11:28 - Bee: What's planned for CU today?
12/02/2020, 11:28 - Bee: I was in college today. Research is progressing. I'm happy about that
12/02/2020, 11:29 - Bee: I skipped dinner last night. I think I'm going to get good from my parents and grandparent once I reach home
12/02/2020, 11:31 - Bee: Don't be in a hurry to reply the any if these questions
12/02/2020, 11:32 - Bee: Just remembering you. And praying you're having a good day. :)
12/02/2020, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Going on fine. It feels like I'm in the calm before the storm
12/02/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Sandwich and a roll
12/02/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing particular. I'm just surviving these days
12/02/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Discussion on something called Alpha. It's kinda long to explain over text so remind me when we talk 😅
12/02/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: That's good! Happy for you 😊
12/02/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Any reason why or were you just not hungry?
12/02/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: I wasn't. I had a lecture so couldn't have replied even though I wanted to
12/02/2020, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. I don't deserve you. Praying the rest of your day is good too!
12/02/2020, 14:33 - Bee: Are you talking about Nikhil?
12/02/2020, 14:33 - Bee: Okay. I'll add it to the list
12/02/2020, 14:34 - Bee: I went to sleep around 8ish because I was too tired to do anything. I was told to eat dinner before I sleep but I said I would eat once I wake up. Which I didn't. Eat, I mean. But nothing happened!
12/02/2020, 14:34 - Bee: Cool. I'm not going anywhere
12/02/2020, 14:35 - Bee: Right back at you, Nischal.
12/02/2020, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: Nope this time it was assignments 😂
12/02/2020, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. Sleeping in the evening messes up my eating cycle as well
12/02/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Not Nikhil? Shocker. :P
12/02/2020, 17:17 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/02/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Going to bed.
12/02/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Goodnight, marshmallow.
12/02/2020, 17:18 - Bee: 🍥 imagine that's a marshmallow
12/02/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Done. Bye. ☺
12/02/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Nikhil won't be coming after all. His visa didn't come through in time. Looks like God has other plans for him at this time
12/02/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! Praise God!!
12/02/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: That's the strangest shaped marshmallow I've seen. Lucky for you I have a very vivid imagination 😁
12/02/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! May your night be restful and your day filled with energy
13/02/2020, 09:03 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debs!
13/02/2020, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: I mean afternoon of course. Hope your day's been fun. I'm excited about my Bible study today. Studying Malachi and I'm learning a thing or two about myself trying to do it
13/02/2020, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: It's a weird dichotomy to meet my guide and have the Bible study on the same day. I'm never looking forward to one but always looking forward for the other
13/02/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Hey. :)
13/02/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Im sorry for such a late reply.
13/02/2020, 12:48 - Bee: Couldn't message even though I wanted to. Been a busy day
13/02/2020, 12:48 - Bee: Is he okay?
13/02/2020, 12:48 - Bee: Marshmallows come in all shapes and sizes!!
13/02/2020, 12:49 - Bee: Sounds good. Which chapter today? Patrick will join today right?
13/02/2020, 12:49 - Bee: Praying about your meeting with your guide. Let me know how it goes
13/02/2020, 13:21 - Bee: Nischal
13/02/2020, 13:21 - Bee: I have two assignments that I need to submit tomorrow
13/02/2020, 13:21 - Bee: It will take around 6 hours in total
13/02/2020, 13:21 - Bee: And I feel like doing nothing
13/02/2020, 14:01 - Bee: I started the assignment. Finished 10%. I'm going to give you updates. Its more for me. Not expecting replies
13/02/2020, 16:03 - Bee: 45% done
13/02/2020, 17:00 - Bee: 70% done with my first
13/02/2020, 17:01 - Bee: The second one is not as time consuming
13/02/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Finished the second one. 3% of the first one still pending
13/02/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that's awesome!!
13/02/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: My meeting with my guide went well too 😁. Really happy with how it weny
13/02/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Went*
13/02/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Malachi 1. Yep I'll be seeing Paddy after a long while!
13/02/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't spoken to him since. I'm sure he's fine
13/02/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Not the ones I've seen... But I have a very limited worldview on marshmallows
13/02/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: I guess you'll be going to bed now. It's been busy days for me too... And I guess it'll continue being so. But I'm glad for them. I'd prefer busy days to those where I'm just sitting home
13/02/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Noooo 30%
13/02/2020, 18:15 - Bee: I'm glad it went well!!
13/02/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Yes. Going to bed. Yes. Busy days are good
13/02/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
14/02/2020, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Late nights and early mornings seem to be a theme for college days
14/02/2020, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Last night Bible study was fun! Had a great time with all 4 of us again. Hope you're days been good so far.
14/02/2020, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Did you manage to finish the assignment finally?
14/02/2020, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: Have a great day!
14/02/2020, 11:41 - Bee: I did. But I also did something very stupid. I'll tell you whenever we talk
14/02/2020, 11:41 - Bee: I had a good day
14/02/2020, 11:42 - Bee: I'm meeting with Reenee somewhere in Thane station. Making plans for the evening once we meet. Looking forward to it
14/02/2020, 11:42 - Bee: How's your day going?
14/02/2020, 16:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I had such a long day. But it's finally over
14/02/2020, 16:27 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds fun!
14/02/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have college tomorrow?
14/02/2020, 17:10 - Bee: I have this thing called a Lamp lighting ceremony tomorrow
14/02/2020, 17:11 - Bee: Have I told you about it ever?
14/02/2020, 17:11 - Bee: That's from 9 to 1
14/02/2020, 17:11 - Bee: I should be back home by 3:30
14/02/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: First I'm hearing of it. Sounds interesting. Is it for the hospital or the college?
14/02/2020, 18:23 - Bee: I'll tell you about it in detail when we talk
14/02/2020, 18:23 - Bee: It is for college but held in an auditorium in the hospital
14/02/2020, 18:24 - Bee: What's up?
14/02/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Nischal
14/02/2020, 18:55 - Bee: You and me, we're like loaves and fishes. We just might be a miracle.
14/02/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Done. Goodnight. 😂
14/02/2020, 21:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! I had an interesting day today. Full of laughter in the evening
14/02/2020, 21:58 - Nischal Abraham: I've added so many items to the list of things we can talk about now. This is awesome 😁
14/02/2020, 23:14 - Bee: Are you going to ignore this awesome line
14/02/2020, 23:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'd starred it for our next phone call. I don't think I get the context but it sounds lovely
14/02/2020, 23:37 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing you have ever told me is ignored Debby :). Just because I don't mention it doesn't mean I haven't seen it. I may forget about some stuff over time but I thank God for every word you've shared with me
15/02/2020, 02:08 - Bee: Nischal
15/02/2020, 02:08 - Bee: I'm sorry if I hurt you by saying this
15/02/2020, 02:10 - Bee: I'll explain the line over the phone :)
15/02/2020, 02:11 - Bee: I thank God for you
15/02/2020, 02:11 - Bee: Good morning. :)
15/02/2020, 02:11 - Bee: I hope you have a productive day today
15/02/2020, 02:11 - Bee: Will you be home today?
15/02/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hii! Don't worry I wasn't hurt. I thought you were joking. I'm sorry if you weren't
15/02/2020, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. For the most part anyway. I'm trying to get out of the house in the evening
15/02/2020, 10:34 - Bee: I was joking. I thought you weren't
15/02/2020, 10:34 - Bee: Oh ... Free to talk? I should be home by 5:30
15/02/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me 😊
15/02/2020, 10:35 - Bee: Okay! Looking forward to it. :)
15/02/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Nischal
15/02/2020, 12:13 - Bee: I'm home
15/02/2020, 12:13 - Bee: There's a special meeting at 6:30 which I had forgotten about
15/02/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Woah it's 12 already 😮
15/02/2020, 12:14 - Bee: A speaker from Holland is taking the meeting
15/02/2020, 12:14 - Bee: What's up?
15/02/2020, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice!
15/02/2020, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just chilling. It's been really windy outside today
15/02/2020, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: We can talk after if you're okay with it
15/02/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Are you going out?
15/02/2020, 12:15 - Bee: I am
15/02/2020, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: After lunch maybe. So the family is having a load of guests over. So I'll probably head to college and be there till the evening
15/02/2020, 12:18 - Bee: Oh
15/02/2020, 12:18 - Bee: I don't know if I'll be back before you leave Nischal
15/02/2020, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I'm hoping you aren't. I was planning on talking to you once I reach college
15/02/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Oh. That works
15/02/2020, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: Wouldn't want to be stuck at home once we started 😅
15/02/2020, 12:20 - Bee: Cool. I was worrying for nothing then
15/02/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: Why were you worrying?
15/02/2020, 12:24 - Bee: That we may not get to talk
15/02/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: I don't want you to worry even if we don't get to talk Debby. There'll always be time for it. And if we're too busy to talk now it just makes the next time we do that much more precious
15/02/2020, 12:27 - Bee: I know I shouldn't but sometimes I can't help it. When I know we can't talk for awhile I'm fine. But today we made plans to talk and then there came the possibility that we may not get a chance...like I said. I was already looking forward to it
15/02/2020, 12:27 - Bee: How are you so wise 😂
15/02/2020, 12:28 - Bee: Definitely makes the next time more precious.
15/02/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: I am not so wise 😂. I get disappointed on days we can't talk too. I think I'm saying a lot of the don't worry stuff to myself more so than to you
15/02/2020, 12:36 - Bee: Okay I'll say it then. Don't worry Nischal
15/02/2020, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. I feel better already
15/02/2020, 12:49 - Bee: 😂
15/02/2020, 12:49 - Bee: What yaaa
15/02/2020, 14:47 - Bee: I'm back home
15/02/2020, 14:47 - Bee: Are you in college m
15/02/2020, 14:47 - Bee: *?
15/02/2020, 14:47 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
15/02/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: That was quick. Or maybe I'm just delayed. I'll be heading to college now. Should be free to talk in 30 min is that okay?
15/02/2020, 15:24 - Bee: Yes. Take your time. I'm free
15/02/2020, 15:26 - Bee: I'll have dinner now
15/02/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Let me know when you're done
15/02/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free now. Just send me a message whenever you are
15/02/2020, 16:17 - Bee: I'll be done in 15
15/02/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome. I'll be here
15/02/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Nischal
15/02/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/02/2020, 16:28 - Bee: Are you free?
15/02/2020, 16:28 - Bee: Or should I wait for 5 more minutes?
15/02/2020, 16:28 - Bee: I thought I would need 15 minutes but I didn't
15/02/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Debby
15/02/2020, 17:12 - Bee: You have to go?
15/02/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: No I have to stay. Do you have to go?
15/02/2020, 17:13 - Bee: No
15/02/2020, 17:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/02/2020, 17:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/02/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I don't think I thanked God enough...sharing the photos so that you can thank God for me too!
15/02/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely praising God for this Debby! It's so much bigger than I thought it was
15/02/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Congratulations! I know it's God's grace in your life but it's also the efforts you've put in to allow His name to be glorified 😊. I'm so happy for you!!!
15/02/2020, 18:25 - Bee: ☺☺☺☺☺☺ thank you.
15/02/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
15/02/2020, 18:25 - Bee: :)
15/02/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby. I'm just finishing up assignments so I didn't see your message earlier. I hope you have a blessed day tomorrow
16/02/2020, 14:36 - Bee: Hey
16/02/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How was your day?
16/02/2020, 15:38 - Bee: It was a good day. We had the WWW thing after worship because some weren't free in the evening
16/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: WWW stands for Women with worth. That's what we named the group 😂
16/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: I messaged because there was a father-daughter dispute while the daughter was driving and the father was impatient (that's what I think). Just wanted to get it out. I'm alright now
16/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: Hows your day going?
16/02/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: On my way home now. I'm in the bus
16/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: SS at Dharamveer Nagar went well. Reenee took the common session today
16/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: Many new kids came
16/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: Gospel meeting went well too. Rolf played the guitar

16/02/2020, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: Will be calling home when I reach home
16/02/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Oh!! Foooood
16/02/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Was it emotional?
16/02/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. There were messages recorded by people who couldn't come that was played on the projector and that was pretty emotional
16/02/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Aww
16/02/2020, 17:50 - Bee: I'm sure Carol is going to look back on this afternoon for many days/months to come
16/02/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Going to bed.
16/02/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
16/02/2020, 17:50 - Bee: I hope the rest of your day goes as you've planned
16/02/2020, 17:50 - Bee: ☺
16/02/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I hope my day goes well too. I'm home now so at least I'm out of the storm 😊
17/02/2020, 12:00 - Bee: Nischal
17/02/2020, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Busy week has started. How's it going for you?

17/02/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Better than I deserve. Got my Bible study today
17/02/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Why better than you deserve?
17/02/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Oh. What about alpha?
17/02/2020, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: Still not sure what's the plan for today for Alpha. I've messaged Abigail and I'm waiting on a reply
17/02/2020, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: What do you have to do once you get home?
17/02/2020, 12:44 - Bee: One assignment, one presentation to prepare for. And I want to start studying for the exam on the 20th
17/02/2020, 12:50 - Bee: Not sure if I'll be able to do all of it
17/02/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: That is quiet a bit. Our lecture has been interesting. Add it to the list 😂. Anyway I hope you manage to finish what you need to today!
17/02/2020, 13:23 - Bee: OkayN
17/02/2020, 13:23 - Bee: !*
17/02/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Marshmallow
17/02/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Goodnight. ☺
18/02/2020, 08:15 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Things went on late last night. I was so exhausted this morning
18/02/2020, 08:16 - Nischal Abraham: How did your day go? Did you manage to finish some things?
18/02/2020, 12:29 - Bee: I finished half my assignment and prepared for the presentation. It went unexpectedly well
18/02/2020, 12:29 - Bee: Haven't started on the exam front yet
18/02/2020, 12:30 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/02/2020, 13:32 - Bee: Sahil's birthday. 19th
18/02/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good!
18/02/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'm in college finishing up assignments. No lecture today but I'm starting a cold :(
18/02/2020, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the heads up. I hope I remember long enough to wish him
18/02/2020, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: When does your exam start?

18/02/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Nischal
18/02/2020, 17:33 - Bee: 🥱
18/02/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Goodnight. :)))

19/02/2020, 06:57 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
19/02/2020, 06:58 - Bee: Gargle with warm salt water. At least once before you leave?
19/02/2020, 06:58 - Bee: I saw you in my dream last night...I have vague memory of it. It was in Pune
19/02/2020, 06:59 - Bee: I'm at home today. Trying to study for the exam.
19/02/2020, 06:59 - Bee: I hope you have a goooood day, Nischal! :)
19/02/2020, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I'm praying for you. Study hard and I hope you won't be stressed about it 😊
19/02/2020, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'll try 😂. It's progressing slowly and so far I've managed to keep it under control so that's good
19/02/2020, 09:06 - Nischal Abraham: I count it as not too bad till the day I find it difficult to sleep. Until such a time it's all good
19/02/2020, 09:06 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I hope you do too!!
19/02/2020, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and I got my provisional results for last sem. Praise God I passed all my modules! 😊. Thank you for being there through it all Debby
19/02/2020, 10:39 - Bee: NISCHAL
19/02/2020, 10:39 - Bee: I'm sure you more than passed
19/02/2020, 10:39 - Bee: Praising God!!!
19/02/2020, 10:39 - Bee: ☺🤗
19/02/2020, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: You're right. I did do really well. This themes been coming up pretty often for me about humility I create and it's become a subconscious thing for me now. Well I'll talk about it detail later. Thank you! 😊
19/02/2020, 13:37 - Bee: Okay.
19/02/2020, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: How's your prep going? Btw you don't have to reply if you're studying
19/02/2020, 17:07 - Bee: Its going alright... I may have to stay up longer because I have a lot left
19/02/2020, 17:07 - Bee: What's up?
19/02/2020, 17:07 - Bee: How's your day going?
19/02/2020, 17:08 - Bee: CU today right?
19/02/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yea there's CU today. There's sooooo much work for assignments for tomorrow. Getting a bit overwhelmed really. I guess I just have to sit down and get the work done
20/02/2020, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby. I hope your exam has/will go well. Although I couldn't message earlier I've been praying. I'm sure you'll be fine :)
20/02/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Hey. :)
20/02/2020, 14:01 - Bee: The exam didn't go well...I'm trying not to think about it
20/02/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Thank you for praying for me, Nischal
20/02/2020, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: :(
20/02/2020, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: Praying harder for your next one. Will you be studying any today or taking a rest day?
20/02/2020, 19:41 - Bee: I have an assignment to complete. I'll do that now. I slept after college because I didn't sleep well last night
20/02/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough. I'm stuck with an assignment that needs to be submitted today as well
20/02/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Still in college competing it

21/02/2020, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I got back home late yesterday and then I was soooo tired
21/02/2020, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the reminder!
21/02/2020, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. I'm praying for your tomorrow as well. And today obviously. Well have a great day!!
21/02/2020, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you manage to find the time and energy to do the things you need to do :)
21/02/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Nischal! :)
21/02/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Bible study?
21/02/2020, 12:39 - Bee: No you had that on Monday right
21/02/2020, 12:40 - Bee: Thank you. :) I had a great day! Except for this one part where my friend and I had an argument. It was my fault.
21/02/2020, 12:40 - Bee: But we spoke about it later and we're good now.
21/02/2020, 12:40 - Bee: How's your day going?
21/02/2020, 12:41 - Bee: I have an exam tomorrow.
21/02/2020, 12:44 - Bee: I was posted in the labour room today. The case that I saw today...was my first of it's kind. I'll tell you about it when we talk.
21/02/2020, 12:46 - Bee: Also, whenever I look at the time, I wonder what's going on at your end
21/02/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Whatever it is, I'm praying that you're doing okay (at least okay). And eating well.
21/02/2020, 12:48 - Bee: I'm craving donuts. With red velvet. Did you know there are red velvet donuts at MOD?
21/02/2020, 12:49 - Bee: I prefer the red velvet waffle tho...
21/02/2020, 12:49 - Bee: Until later. Bye.
21/02/2020, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!
21/02/2020, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry I haven't found the time to reply to you sooner 😞
21/02/2020, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: Finishing up the assignment. I reached home at 10:40
21/02/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: Had a busy day and a fun night. I'll tell you about it when we talk
21/02/2020, 21:43 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying! Let me know how it goes
21/02/2020, 21:43 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to hearing about it
21/02/2020, 21:44 - Nischal Abraham: Either a lecture or food break 😂
21/02/2020, 21:45 - Nischal Abraham: I think I do. But I agree waffles are better 😁. I've only ever had the chocolate stuff at MOD and that's too rich for me. I prefer Krispy Kreme glazed among donuts
21/02/2020, 21:46 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I hope you're well rested for today when you write your exam. You're always in my prayers :)
22/02/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Hey
22/02/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Today's went well. :) I didn't expect it to go this well
22/02/2020, 16:58 - Bee: I've never had Krispy Kreme donuts
22/02/2020, 16:58 - Bee: The one in Viviana shut down
22/02/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Patti is admitted in the hospital. She's got pneumonia. I went to meet her straight from college
22/02/2020, 17:02 - Bee: I took flowers!! I found ones that I like on my way there
22/02/2020, 17:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/02/2020, 17:03 - Bee: And my parents offered to buy me new shoes!!!! That turned into dinner plans. And I just came home
22/02/2020, 17:03 - Bee: I'm sorry I didn't make time to reply. :(
22/02/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lot has happened!
22/02/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God! So glad to hear it 😁
22/02/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's sad
22/02/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! How is she doing now?
22/02/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: They look beautiful. Almost fake
22/02/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! What's the occasion?
22/02/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be :). I'm glad you're busy with things
22/02/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Health wise not okay... On continuous oxygen. She'll take a few days to recover
But she's smiling and singing
22/02/2020, 17:46 - Bee: I asked her if she wanted me to sing (something I did with Flory Aunty in her last years) Patti said okay. I asked her what her favorite hymn was. Guess which one she told me
22/02/2020, 17:46 - Bee: They are!!
22/02/2020, 17:46 - Bee: The soles of my old running shoes came off
22/02/2020, 17:47 - Bee: No occasion as such
22/02/2020, 17:47 - Bee: I think the gold medal may have done a bit tho
22/02/2020, 17:47 - Bee: How's your day going.
22/02/2020, 17:47 - Bee: ?*
22/02/2020, 17:47 - Bee: At home?
22/02/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: I am indeed home
22/02/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: That's good
22/02/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: I have nothing to go on but here's a random guess, 'Abide with me'?
22/02/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh ye! Now you have to go running with new shoes 😁
22/02/2020, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: It's been alright so far. I had a nice shower in the morning. Hopefully the evening ends up being a bit more productive
22/02/2020, 17:59 - Bee: YES!!!
22/02/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Yes. I've been told that at least thrice already
22/02/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Do you have assignments to work on?
22/02/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: Sort of
22/02/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh lucky guess
22/02/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing urgent. I spent extra time through the week finishing up my work so I'd be a bit more relaxed today
22/02/2020, 18:32 - Bee: HOW DID YOU KNOW
22/02/2020, 18:33 - Bee: That's wise.
22/02/2020, 18:33 - Bee: What's up?
22/02/2020, 18:33 - Bee: What are you doing?
22/02/2020, 18:33 - Bee: What was for lunch?
22/02/2020, 18:33 - Bee: And breakfast?
22/02/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Lying down. My cold is on its last legs
22/02/2020, 18:34 - Bee: How are you feeling?
22/02/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Tortilla wraps with stuff in them
22/02/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Wow! What stuff?
22/02/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Much better today. I was sicker yesterday
22/02/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Basic stuff. Cheese, hummus, cold slice of meat
22/02/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: One with ketchup
22/02/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Is your throat still affected? Are you gargling with warm salt water?
22/02/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Yum. Keep it up, Nischal
22/02/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: It's moved out of my chest and throat. Just a blocked nose occasionally now. Being active has helped 😁
22/02/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: It's lazy meals Debby! Don't encourage it 😂
22/02/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: How come you're still up?
22/02/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: I was almost certain you'd have gone to bed
22/02/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Add veggies and it's healthy too!
22/02/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I was too lazy to chop the tomatoes and onions
22/02/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Messaging you. I'll sleep on a few
22/02/2020, 18:37 - Bee: In*
22/02/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Oh
22/02/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'll so something more for dinner. Cook up some eggs and add tomatoes to that
22/02/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: I have to buy stuff on my way home tomorrow from Fairview
22/02/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Oh
22/02/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Trying a new recipe?
22/02/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Try!!
22/02/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Just more food
22/02/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: We'll see. I don't feel motivated for anything today. Maybe tomorrow will be a different story
22/02/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Reenee will be going for the Sunday School in TMT Nagar from tomorrow... There's nobody to take the singing there
22/02/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Yes tomorrow
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Oh Tryphena is a Sunday school teacher now!!
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. And you'll be in the other place then?
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Bee: And Nathan's board exams have begun
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: She really wants to be in the older crowd huh 😂
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Yes.
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Bee: 😂
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Bee: We need more teachers
22/02/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Ah! I'll add that to my prayer list
22/02/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Okay. And there's the baptism service tomorrow
22/02/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: More help is always good.
22/02/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I saw the group chat
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Oh
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Do you want to ask me anything
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: For a second I was wondering who Rachel was
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Bee: 😱
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Whaaaatt
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Then I remembered it must be Rachel James 😂
22/02/2020, 18:42 - Bee: It's been only 5 months since you left!
22/02/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: It feels sooo much longer if I'm being honest
22/02/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Just so much has happened. And everything is new
22/02/2020, 18:43 - Bee: In a good way?
22/02/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Are you prepared for tomorrow?
22/02/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Worship? Sunday school, m
22/02/2020, 18:43 - Bee: ?*
22/02/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: So far it's been blessings :)
22/02/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Take your pick
22/02/2020, 18:44 - Bee: I think so and yes
22/02/2020, 18:44 - Bee: There's always more that I can do though
22/02/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Bible study with Malachi just brought back reminders of bringing blemished offering
22/02/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well I pray you have a great day tomorrow! Busiest day of the week 😊
22/02/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Thank you for the reminder. I'm ashamed to say that the seriousness of it is lost on me many times
22/02/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'm really happy to know your exam went well. I miss hearing your voice. And the days go by so quickly sometimes
22/02/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: On me too. Just something to keep reminding ourselves
22/02/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: I've been getting some clarity on things I've been studying. I'll tell you more when we talk
22/02/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: But Debby. Shouldn't you be sleeping?
22/02/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Malachi? Humility?
22/02/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Okay. When we talk.
22/02/2020, 18:48 - Bee: I should.
22/02/2020, 18:49 - Bee: I miss you. Looking forward to seeing you. Whenever that is.
22/02/2020, 18:49 - Bee: I hope the rest of your day goes as you've planned.
22/02/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
22/02/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I look forward to it too. I just hope I'm patient enough to keep looking forward when the time comes 😊
22/02/2020, 18:51 - Bee: I didn't understand
22/02/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Ah I guess that one's more just for me than it is for you
22/02/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Again, I didn't understand
22/02/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Don't overthink it 😂. Messages are a terrible medium to explain things
22/02/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'll tell it to you proper when we are on a call
22/02/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Okay.
22/02/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Bye marshmallow.
22/02/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I shouldn't have said anything at all. Debby... Please don't think it's negative
22/02/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I am not...
22/02/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I'm not overthinking
22/02/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: It really isn't. Okay. Hope you dream of rainbows and sunshine
22/02/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Byeee!
23/02/2020, 13:54 - Bee: Hey :)
23/02/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Will you be free to talk later today M
23/02/2020, 13:58 - Bee: ?*
23/02/2020, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy!
23/02/2020, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I should be. Once I'm home I've got nowhere to be. But I'm still on the bus now
23/02/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Safe to say it may be another hour before I get free to talk. But after that there's no time limit
23/02/2020, 14:00 - Bee: Yay!!
23/02/2020, 14:00 - Bee: We're having guests over for dinner. I should be free by 10
23/02/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! I'll let you know when I'm home. Then you just let me know whenever you're free :)
23/02/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm home
23/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: Okay. Having dinner. I'll let you know when I'm free
23/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: Looking forward to talking to you, Nischal. ☺
23/02/2020, 15:42 - Bee: I'm feeling the same way that I felt right before I would meet you all those times before you left
23/02/2020, 15:42 - Bee: I don't know why
23/02/2020, 15:42 - Bee: Bye!
23/02/2020, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: Can't wait! I'll be here when you're done. Take your time
23/02/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Hey!
23/02/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
23/02/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: All good?
23/02/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Yes
23/02/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Give me 5 minutes
23/02/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: 👍🏼
23/02/2020, 17:44 - Bee: Nischal
23/02/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yep?
23/02/2020, 17:44 - Bee: I'll call?
23/02/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yes
23/02/2020, 19:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
23/02/2020, 21:27 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/-RkZXZx6HCI
23/02/2020, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: Whenever you get the time. Sleep is priority over this though
24/02/2020, 05:42 - Bee: Okay.
24/02/2020, 05:44 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)))))))))))))
24/02/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon/evening. I ended up oversleeping 😶
24/02/2020, 11:53 - Bee: Oh no. Late night?
24/02/2020, 11:53 - Bee: Going to college?
24/02/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Not at all. My phone died and the alarm didn't ring
24/02/2020, 12:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I'll leave now. Missed the first half. And there's also Alpha today
24/02/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Oh
24/02/2020, 13:57 - Bee: Praying for alpha and everyone who attends
24/02/2020, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. How was your workshop?
24/02/2020, 19:53 - Bee: It was alright. A lot about interview skills, confidence and all that. I'm there tomorrow as well
24/02/2020, 19:54 - Bee: I came home and slept for a while. Going back to sleep now. That makes it 9 hours of sleep!
24/02/2020, 19:54 - Bee: I hope Alpha goes without any trouble
24/02/2020, 19:55 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
24/02/2020, 22:32 - Nischal Abraham: Alpha was wonderful! It was a beautiful time and I really hope more people will join next week
24/02/2020, 22:33 - Nischal Abraham: Woah Debby! You actually caught up on lost sleep
24/02/2020, 22:33 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like important stuff
24/02/2020, 22:33 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I hope you have a wonderful day tomorrow as well.
25/02/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!!
25/02/2020, 13:18 - Bee: How are you?
25/02/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing good. How are you?  Today is self study day so no lectures
25/02/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I'm doing good too ☺
25/02/2020, 18:26 - Bee: So you're in college?
25/02/2020, 18:31 - Bee: Postings begin tomorrow. And they're in the main hospital. Not the maternity one.
25/02/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
25/02/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Praying you have a good day!
25/02/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Heading home now. It's terribly cold today at the bus stop
26/02/2020, 09:12 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
26/02/2020, 09:12 - Bee: I'm posted in the casualty. Been running around since morning
26/02/2020, 09:36 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I haven't been running enough
26/02/2020, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Must be busy. Hope your day is amazing!
26/02/2020, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm lagging behind on my assignments by quite a bit at this moment. I'll have to put aside all extra fun activities aside for a while if I ever hope of catching up. Sounds dreadful even to me when I say it
26/02/2020, 15:15 - Bee: Aww no. So that's CU?
26/02/2020, 15:16 - Bee: Wise to hold off meets until you finish
26/02/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: But I'll never finish 😶. There's always new and more. I need to discipline myself more
26/02/2020, 20:19 - Bee: Do what you have to do Nischal. You have a good record from your first sem. And only 3ish months to go
26/02/2020, 20:23 - Bee: Also, thanking God for you and the last 6 months. :)
26/02/2020, 20:23 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
26/02/2020, 20:43 - Bee: Also, night shifts begin tomorrow 😯
26/02/2020, 20:44 - Bee: And it's Reenee's birthday (27th)
26/02/2020, 21:18 - Nischal Abraham: I thank God for every one of those days too. And also for all the ones before of preparing us. And for the ones to follow, full of wonder and unsureness, and yet I can't wait to experience every one of them with you
26/02/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: You have night shifts!? I thought that was only for nurses after they graduate. I guess there's always something new to learn
26/02/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying you enjoy them. Does that mean you'll be home in the morning?
27/02/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Nischal
27/02/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Hey :)
27/02/2020, 12:55 - Bee: On my way to my first night shift.
27/02/2020, 12:55 - Bee: I'm nervous. Because I'm posted in the casualty
27/02/2020, 12:56 - Bee: And I had a tiny injury on my right thumb yesterday. Finding it hard to work with my hands
27/02/2020, 12:56 - Bee: Yes. 8pm today to 8am tomorrow
27/02/2020, 23:13 - Bee: Nischal
27/02/2020, 23:13 - Bee: You okay?
28/02/2020, 00:34 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy! I've been praying for your night shift. I hope it's been going on well
28/02/2020, 00:35 - Nischal Abraham: How did it happen? Were you okay?
28/02/2020, 00:36 - Nischal Abraham: I am. Just a busy day. But it's been such a blessing Debby! Remind me of Thursday when we talk next
28/02/2020, 00:37 - Nischal Abraham: And let me know how your first night shift goes! I'm sure it'll be hard but God is your strength through all the tough times so I'm confident you'll get through 😊
28/02/2020, 14:20 - Bee: I'll tell you when we talk...better now
28/02/2020, 14:20 - Bee: It was a rough night Nischal :( I don't think I like night shifts
28/02/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think anyone likes night shifts for anything. Do you have another night shift soon?
28/02/2020, 15:02 - Bee: Yes. Today. And tomorrow.
28/02/2020, 15:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying!
28/02/2020, 15:30 - Bee: 😔
28/02/2020, 15:33 - Bee: Please do
28/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: Thank you
28/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: How's your day going?
28/02/2020, 15:41 - Bee: I've been too busy or asleep to message Nischal
28/02/2020, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: That's perfectly fine. I'd be to busy to reply too. I'm doing well. Today's lecture was good. Have an assignment I have to submit by tonight
29/02/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby! Good afternoon... How was day 2?
29/02/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Or I guess it's more accurate to say night 2?
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Hey :)
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Night 2 was much better
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: I think I was too hard on myself the first night
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Yesterday's shift was uneventful. Which is goood.
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Did you finish your assignment M
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: mz
29/02/2020, 15:39 - Bee: *?
29/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
29/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: I'll be missing worship tomorrow :(
29/02/2020, 15:40 - Bee: I hope I get a morning or evening shift next week
29/02/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad you had an uneventful night 😁
29/02/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: I submitted it. Wouldn't say it's finished. I'll just have to do better next time
29/02/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: Today is a good day. Yesterday was also good but ended up terribly
29/02/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: I joined a climbing competition which took place today. It was so much fun!
29/02/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no. I fear you'll have to get used to that being a common occurrence with night shifts
29/02/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying you do
29/02/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
01/03/2020, 17:58 - Bee: NISCHALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
01/03/2020, 17:58 - Bee: What happened?!
01/03/2020, 17:58 - Bee: Well done, Nischal! :)
01/03/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I came home from the shift and went to sleep. Woke up in time for Sunday school and then went for the gospel meeting
01/03/2020, 17:59 - Bee: After gospel us girls went out for dinner because Reenee's birthday
01/03/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I had decided that I would come home straight from the gospel but it was Reenee's thing and Lakshmi was excited so I went
01/03/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Came home and hour ago and now ready for bed
01/03/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I have a morning shift this week
01/03/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Hey!!!
01/03/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Been so long, Nischal
01/03/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hey :). It's been a minute
01/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: What nooooooooo
01/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: How's your day going?
01/03/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough. Night shift to morning must be tiring
01/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: It is. I didn't even get a complete day off
01/03/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Are you sleeping immediately?
01/03/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Not for few minutes
01/03/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Quick call?
01/03/2020, 18:02 - Bee: What happened?

01/03/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Give me a minute
01/03/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing at all... I just got up from a nap
01/03/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Btw it's fine if you can't make the call! I hope you're not going out of your routine and comfort for it... It's nothing urgent
01/03/2020, 18:07 - Bee: I'll call?
01/03/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yep

02/03/2020, 11:52 - Bee: I have morning shifts this week. But the timings are 7 to 3. Which means I have to leave at 5am but I will be back an hour early too
02/03/2020, 11:52 - Bee: Which means I can go for the prayer meeting!
02/03/2020, 11:53 - Bee: How's your day going?
02/03/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! That's awesome!! Early back home is always a nice feeling :)

02/03/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Praying for the volunteers and everyone else who comes
02/03/2020, 19:01 - Bee: I had a great day :)
03/03/2020, 08:29 - Nischal Abraham: He gave time till next week now
03/03/2020, 08:29 - Nischal Abraham: It's alright I guess. There's a lot of assignments for this subject since there's no written paper for it
03/03/2020, 08:30 - Nischal Abraham: Alpha was amazing again! Such a good time meeting new people and talking about Jesus Christ with them
03/03/2020, 08:30 - Nischal Abraham: I'm happy to hear it Debby :). I hope you have a great day today as well. 
And good afternoon!!
03/03/2020, 13:09 - Bee: 😃

03/03/2020, 13:10 - Bee: That's good. All students from Maynooth?
03/03/2020, 13:10 - Bee: How's your day going?
03/03/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Are you back home? Or did you have the option of staying home today?
03/03/2020, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: I had the option of staying home but I'm in college. Had an interesting day
03/03/2020, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't that good?
03/03/2020, 14:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. It is in Maynooth so it's always with students
03/03/2020, 16:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
03/03/2020, 16:46 - Bee: It is. Those are tears of joy
03/03/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! She stayed on the call!?
03/03/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Yes
03/03/2020, 17:18 - Bee: She's a chatterbox now
03/03/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Soooooo cute
03/03/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome ☺️. How was your day?
03/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Tiring but good
03/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Going to sleep now
03/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
03/03/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee :)
04/03/2020, 00:12 - Bee: Nischal
04/03/2020, 07:12 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
04/03/2020, 07:12 - Nischal Abraham: How are you doing?
04/03/2020, 10:59 - Bee: I'm alright
04/03/2020, 10:59 - Bee: How are you?
04/03/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright too. It just feels like every time I think I'm on top of things, something makes me realise how far behind I'm lagging on submissions 😢
04/03/2020, 14:30 - Bee: Procrastinating again?
04/03/2020, 14:30 - Bee: Anything planned for after college today?
04/03/2020, 14:39 - Bee: Sing a hymn and start working!! I'm telling myself this too
04/03/2020, 14:45 - Bee: Also, I added the 50th item to the Possible list
So many things to do Nischal!
04/03/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Always :(
04/03/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: There's CU today
04/03/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'll do that. When I have the time to do things I lose all motivation 😂
04/03/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: 50!!? How are there so many already 😮
04/03/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I don't know!! It just happened 😂
04/03/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Make a checklist?
Set reminders?
Tell me to reprimand?
Pray and sit down?
04/03/2020, 17:03 - Bee: There's this thing that I do which works sometimes. Too long to type it out. I'll tell you the next time we talk
04/03/2020, 17:04 - Bee: I sat down with the family and talked today.. nothing particular. Everything that came up... Instead if sitting in the room telling everyone that I'm tired
I had fun. :)
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: It was an okay day today. Okay is good
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: Heading to bed now
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: Don't reply if you can't
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Okay :)
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: I'll just read your messages tomorrow morning
04/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: Hope CU goes well
04/03/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds lovely
04/03/2020, 17:06 - Bee: It was
04/03/2020, 17:06 - Bee: Bye! :))))))))))
04/03/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I'll send in my messages later in the day
04/03/2020, 17:06 - Bee: Looking forward to it
04/03/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so too. Won't be too many people in today. I'll tell you about it on a call
04/03/2020, 17:08 - Bee: :)
05/03/2020, 07:32 - Nischal Abraham: CU was a small crowd and it was quiet short. A majority of people had gone for the CU ball
05/03/2020, 07:33 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't really do much work even later in the day. But I've been feeling incredibly burdened about mental disorders and people suffering through them
05/03/2020, 07:34 - Nischal Abraham: It's the weirdest thing. I don't know why I'm feeling so strongly about it 😶. But anywho... Looking forward to today. 
Have to meet my guide and go for the Bible study. Still loving the dichotomy of emotions for the two 😂
05/03/2020, 11:45 - Bee: CU ball? How come you didn't go?
05/03/2020, 12:19 - Bee: That may be God telling you something.. Pray about it. Ask God to give you a clear indication/direction
05/03/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal :)
06/03/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Hope your having an amazing day
06/03/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: It was 40 EUR for entry
06/03/2020, 16:16 - Bee: Hey!
06/03/2020, 16:16 - Bee: I had an evening shift today
06/03/2020, 16:16 - Bee: My day went alright
06/03/2020, 16:17 - Bee: Went to a nursing college for research before my shift
06/03/2020, 16:17 - Bee: How's your day going?
06/03/2020, 16:17 - Bee: How did the Bible study and the meet with your professor go?
06/03/2020, 17:24 - Bee: https://youtu.be/QiH31PYouAc
06/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Nischal
06/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: I miss you
06/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Bye!
06/03/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Is that the same as a night shift?
06/03/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Had a lecture for most of the day. I met my guide today, since yesterday's lecture went on too long and I couldn't meet him
06/03/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: I feel guilty for not replying earlier Debby. And I don't mean just to you... My network ends up being off for the whole time I'm in college, and then when I do switch it on its when I'm home for dinner and then I just want to head to bed and I end up not replying to anyone :(
06/03/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: The Bible study was good though. So was climbing. We finished with Malachi and next week Stephen isn't around so we're doing Jude
06/03/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh Daniel is speaking at Fairview this week!!
06/03/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you loads too. Let me know if you're free anytime tomorrow for a call. Honestly I'll have to see if I'm free too
07/03/2020, 07:36 - Bee: Nope. Evening shift timings are from 12pm to 8pm
07/03/2020, 07:39 - Bee: Nischal, don't worry about it. I'm not going anywhere
07/03/2020, 07:43 - Bee: Oh!! So does that mean you have 3 kids for Sunday school? Or will there be no Sunday school?
07/03/2020, 07:43 - Bee: I'm free later tonight. Let me know of you are. Tomorrow night works for me too
07/03/2020, 07:43 - Bee: If*
07/03/2020, 07:43 - Bee: Also, I hope you have a goooood day today. :)
07/03/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby! Hope you're having a great day too!
I'm not sure about Sunday school. Even if it is there Hannah is too small to sit there so it'll still be 2
07/03/2020, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good. I'll let you know when I'm free as well. Heading out for brunch to some Indian restaurant in the city with my classmates
07/03/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby
07/03/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
07/03/2020, 17:14 - Bee: Hey :)
07/03/2020, 17:14 - Bee: My day was alright
07/03/2020, 17:15 - Bee: There was a Dharamveer Nagar Sunday school meet at Amaresh bhaiyyas house in the evening. To discuss how the classes have to be taken and stuff... It went really well. I'm blessed to be a part of it
07/03/2020, 17:15 - Bee: And then maa and I went out for a bit
07/03/2020, 17:15 - Bee: I've been driving around now!!!
07/03/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Woah!!!
07/03/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Driving without your dad?
07/03/2020, 17:16 - Bee: How's your day going?
07/03/2020, 17:16 - Bee: No no. Maa won't let me. Not for a month at least
07/03/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: On my way home now. I'm in the bus. Should reach in another 15-20 min I'd say
07/03/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Ahh
07/03/2020, 17:17 - Bee: It was a whole day thing then
07/03/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Did you have to go to college M
07/03/2020, 17:17 - Bee: ?*
07/03/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Ended up being that way. I didn't go to college no, we ended up going to city centre and to a mall there
07/03/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Ahh
07/03/2020, 17:18 - Bee: How was the Indian food?
07/03/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Alright. It was chole batura. Really oily but for nostalgia's sake it was good
07/03/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Oh there was lassi too that was good!
07/03/2020, 17:19 - Bee: No chicken?!
07/03/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. It was all veg
07/03/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Chilled thick and sweet? 😋
07/03/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: And North Indian. We stopped at another place for sweets as well but I'm not big on sweets so didn't have any
07/03/2020, 17:24 - Bee: Indian sweets?
07/03/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
07/03/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Have you reached home?
07/03/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I really want to talk but it's kinda late now Nischal
07/03/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I should go to bed early
07/03/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: If you need to go to bed that's alright
07/03/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: We can talk tomorrow if you want
07/03/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: I just got home
07/03/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Tired from your day?
07/03/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Yes. Been getting less than 5 hours of sleep this week because of the 7am shifts
07/03/2020, 17:39 - Bee: I would love to. Will you be free? Your 5ish
07/03/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry I couldn't be free earlier today :(
07/03/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: I should be. I really hope I reach home in time. If I don't I'll message and let you know
07/03/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Daniels invited me for lunch after worship so I'll be there right after
07/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: No don't be. It's the time zone's fault
07/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: I'll be up for a while
07/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Your 6ish is okay too
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: I'm just hoping we get to talk
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: Even if it's a short call
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so too :)
07/03/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy sleep Debby! I know how hard it must be for you to get any during the week. I hope you have a great day tomorrow

07/03/2020, 17:55 - Bee: I hope you have a great day too Nischal

07/03/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Always
07/03/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: I'm making the assumption you're talking about you and me
07/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Your assumption is correct
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Thank you.
08/03/2020, 08:00 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
08/03/2020, 08:00 - Bee: I hope you have a special time of worship and with Daniel and fam

10/03/2020, 08:54 - Bee: Sanitizers don't work as well and soap and water
10/03/2020, 08:54 - Bee: Okay bye
10/03/2020, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. Cause I don't have a sanitizer anyway 😅. Soap and water all the way. Have a great day Debby! I don't know if I told you but I have my PPS appointment today. It's the tax document needed to work here
10/03/2020, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: So I'll be heading to the government office. Keep me in prayers if you read this in time. But even if you do read it later still pray for this. Hopefully all my documents are good enough
10/03/2020, 12:05 - Bee: I don't know if I'm late.. Praying anyway
10/03/2020, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for praying :). It went by smoothly. No hitches
10/03/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have a holiday today?

10/03/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Thinking of you often.
10/03/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Bye,!
10/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Exercising with other people is so much more fun than doing it alone
10/03/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Just asking
Please do not read too much into it
Do you think of me too?
10/03/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: I do. Did you stay up this long thinking about it?
10/03/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Yes
I'll try to go to sleep now
Bye
10/03/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Debby... Are you okay?
10/03/2020, 19:45 - Bee: I am not
10/03/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Want to talk about it?
10/03/2020, 19:50 - Bee: It's late
10/03/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying Debby. I'm here if you want to talk
10/03/2020, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: Or we can chat. Whatever you're comfortable with
10/03/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Even if it's about you?
10/03/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Are you back home?
10/03/2020, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: I am home. And especially if it's about me
10/03/2020, 20:07 - Bee: I don't know if it'll make sense but I'm just going to type it out. Probably wiser to tell you on a phone call but I really don't want to talk right now... I am sorry
Also, these are thoughts which aren't in any particular order
In the first few months of the relationship we chatted so often... Taking out a minute between schedules to do so. But now it hardly ever happens.. And you did say that the feelings are no longer there for you which makes me think if all that talking was out of feelings only and whether it's going to be there way it is henceforth
Also, whenever I think of messaging you (even if you haven't replied to the previous ones) I hold myself back because I'd hate it if you start thinking I'm clingy.
But sometimes I don't message because i tell myself that if he (he refers to you) really wants to message then he will. And I understand (99.9 out of 100 times) that you're busy and even if you really wanted to message your wouldn't be able to but sometimes (0.01 out of 100) it's hard for me to believe that
I was up trying to cry it all out because crying does bake me feel better but it just want working so I messaged you the question
10/03/2020, 20:08 - Bee: This is very long. It's okay if you can't read all of it and reply if you have stuff to do
10/03/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Just reply whenever you can and I'll check once I wake up...
10/03/2020, 20:09 - Bee: Also I'm probably missing a few thoughts that were going on in my mind (crying must have worked a bit). If I remember, I'll let you know
10/03/2020, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: I read all of it. It isn't that long... But feels really deep
10/03/2020, 20:12 - Bee: While I'm telling you all the stuff I thought I wouldn't I'd like to add this too
From the messages it must be evident that I've been crying. And I know that some men ( I'm not saying you're one of them) think women use their tears as ammo or whatever but I'm not doing any of that... Crying just really helps sometimes
10/03/2020, 20:12 - Bee: I'm sorry if you think this is too much... Take your time.
10/03/2020, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: Firstly, I'm a bit relieved that this is what's bothering you
10/03/2020, 20:15 - Bee: You're relieved?!
10/03/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Instinctively I just want to answer all the points you brought up... But I don't think that would help
10/03/2020, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hear me out. I know it sounds heartless but there's reasons why I think so
10/03/2020, 20:17 - Nischal Abraham: The first few months was a beautiful time. I genuinely just kept thinking only about you in everything I was experiencing
10/03/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: But I wouldn't trade that for the stage we're at now Debby. Right now, I'm confident that you are in this relationship to the end. And even though there'll be days or weeks between us making contact, I have a calm assurance knowing that this thing we have is stronger than every message that is sent
10/03/2020, 20:24 - Nischal Abraham: I always ended up trying too hard to keep a relationship going because I had to rely on myself everyone before...
But that's not the case with you. I've committed this to the Lord and I am certain that there's nothing I could do to make our relationship any surer
10/03/2020, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not justifying my lack of keeping in touch. God knows I'm guilty of that on all counts with everyone. But somehow with you I'm never worried of going out of touch... Before anything else in the relationship I've always wanted to be your best friend
10/03/2020, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: So I'm relieved you brought it up. I'm relieved it's something I can do something about. We could probably do better with me trying harder to message more often :)

I just hope it doesn't stay this way where you have to think this long to tell me about it
10/03/2020, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: I hope we reach a stage in our lives where you can be clingy and I'd tell you that you are... Because we're soooo far away from that right now
10/03/2020, 20:33 - Nischal Abraham: My point is until the day I tell you to stop (I'd kick myself if I do), please don't hesitate to message me. I wish there was a way to show you emotions cause if you could see what I feel when I read your messages, you wouldn't hold back for a minute
10/03/2020, 20:35 - Nischal Abraham: ^i know that's long. You don't need to reply specifically. You don't need to justify yourself either. 
P.s. crying is good. I envy that ability in people :)
10/03/2020, 20:45 - Bee: I waited hoping all of this would roll over me and because you have an amazing thing going on there...I didn't want to be the reason you're upset
And also because I didn't want you to message because you think you have to... Only if you want to.
10/03/2020, 20:45 - Bee: Don't*
10/03/2020, 20:47 - Bee: I have committed to Lord too
Please don't think that me wanting to keep in touch and the time is not trying to keep this relationship going because I know that won't work
I just want to know how things are going at your end and want you to know how much you mean to me... And praying for you and messaging you are the only two ways to do it
10/03/2020, 20:48 - Bee: I have committed this to the Lord too*
10/03/2020, 20:48 - Bee: All the time*
10/03/2020, 20:48 - Bee: *is me trying to keep
10/03/2020, 20:48 - Bee: Sorry for the typos
10/03/2020, 20:50 - Bee: It's just that sometimes I feel I'm more invested in this relationship than you are
10/03/2020, 20:56 - Nischal Abraham: I know you are. And I'm so glad for it too. I'm still working towards getting there
10/03/2020, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: But most times I just don't know how
10/03/2020, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm figuring this out as we go, and I wouldn't want to do it with anyone else
10/03/2020, 21:00 - Bee: I'm not going to tell you what to do or what not to do... I'm learning too. We'll get there one day
10/03/2020, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: I wish I could ask you to trust me in this. But I can't. Not truthfully. I don't trust myself with most things... 
All I can ask is that you'll trust God to work in me through this
10/03/2020, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I know it's a lot but could you be patient with me?
10/03/2020, 21:07 - Bee: YES. But I can't promise I won't have moments of weakness and insecurity like I did tonight
10/03/2020, 21:08 - Bee: I know I won't wait long to tell you about it though.
10/03/2020, 21:09 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to it :). I just think it's a lot better getting it out than keeping it in
10/03/2020, 21:10 - Bee: I know it is. But this ^
Guess I'll have to ruin a day or two of yours then.
10/03/2020, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: Well here's the thing. I'll still only message because I want to... And you let me know when that's too little
10/03/2020, 21:12 - Bee: I don't think it's right for me to decide Nischal
10/03/2020, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: Only a day or two? I was hoping for an excuse of long conversations with you for waay longer
10/03/2020, 21:13 - Bee: A day or two is the minimum. We'll find out how much it actually is
10/03/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: You're right. But I don't want you to feel upset about it either
10/03/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Then what do we do
10/03/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Have you eaten dinner?
10/03/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Sounds like a great opportunity for a fight if we're headstrong about our own opinion
10/03/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: Not yet
10/03/2020, 21:15 - Bee: When will you eat?
10/03/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: Later. I had a sandwich in the evening cause I was hungry. And now I'm not hungry
10/03/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Underweight runners do run faster but what if it's windy in the opposite direction... You won't finish the half marathon then
10/03/2020, 21:18 - Bee: It would've already been one if we were on a phone call
10/03/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: You think so?
10/03/2020, 21:19 - Bee: From my side yes
10/03/2020, 21:19 - Bee: I don't know about you
10/03/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: The wind won't be the reason for me not to finish the race... It'll be cause I can't run that long
10/03/2020, 21:19 - Bee: You have time to prepare
10/03/2020, 21:20 - Bee: I'll try not to feel upset about it
10/03/2020, 21:20 - Nischal Abraham: And missed opportunity for a fight then 😕. Looks like we'll have to wait for another time
10/03/2020, 21:20 - Bee: Yes
10/03/2020, 21:21 - Nischal Abraham: Noooo... That's not the solution I was thinking of. How about you be upset but we talk about you being upset
10/03/2020, 21:21 - Nischal Abraham: How do you NOT feel upset about something that upsets you?
10/03/2020, 21:21 - Nischal Abraham: That's the same as bottling it up
10/03/2020, 21:21 - Bee: I try not to think about it
10/03/2020, 21:22 - Nischal Abraham: .
10/03/2020, 21:22 - Bee: Okay. But what if it's too often Nischal
10/03/2020, 21:23 - Nischal Abraham: And what if it is
10/03/2020, 21:23 - Bee: I'd hate it if you think 'why is Debby so sensitive' and stuff
10/03/2020, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't thought of you in that way so far. If anything I have the complete opposite view
10/03/2020, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: And tonight hasn't changed that opinion one bit
10/03/2020, 21:24 - Bee: You think I'm insensitive?!
10/03/2020, 21:24 - Bee: That's a relief.
10/03/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: 😮
10/03/2020, 21:25 - Bee: ?
10/03/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: You caught me there. I have no rebuttal
10/03/2020, 21:25 - Bee: Seeeeee
10/03/2020, 21:25 - Bee: There's no winning
10/03/2020, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm okay with not winning as long as you're okay
10/03/2020, 21:26 - Bee: Okay. Works for me.
10/03/2020, 21:27 - Nischal Abraham: Though now that I think about it... Why is you being sensitive a bad thing?
10/03/2020, 21:27 - Bee: Being sensitive isn't 
Maybe being too sensitive is
More sensitive than you'd like to deal with
10/03/2020, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't found my threshold yet. It's all new to me... How about we discover it together 😁
10/03/2020, 21:28 - Bee: I'd like that.
10/03/2020, 21:29 - Bee: :)
10/03/2020, 21:29 - Nischal Abraham: Will you please sleep? I'm worried you don't be rested enough :(
10/03/2020, 21:30 - Bee: I'll go to sleep now
10/03/2020, 21:31 - Nischal Abraham: Debby. Thank you for talking it through. It couldn't have been easy to do... I'm really grateful for you
10/03/2020, 21:32 - Bee: Thank you for listening and handling it so well, Nischal.
10/03/2020, 21:32 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
10/03/2020, 21:32 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee. I hope you have a great day ahead!
10/03/2020, 21:33 - Bee: I hope you have a great one too. Bye
10/03/2020, 21:33 - Nischal Abraham: Bye :)
11/03/2020, 07:40 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
11/03/2020, 07:40 - Bee: I hope you have a great day today!
11/03/2020, 07:41 - Bee: I have a research thing today. Going to another nursing college to teach the kids a fee emergency drugs. I'll let you know how it goes
11/03/2020, 07:47 - Bee: I've been re-reading this message since morning. Especially the last part. And I love that you said that. Thank you for thinking that way
11/03/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I hope your day is going well too 😊
11/03/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Will be praying for it
11/03/2020, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for reading through all of it. I just scrolled up to see it and realised I typed way too much 😳
11/03/2020, 11:48 - Bee: I think it went well! It's was the last hour of the day so they were kinda dull. Can't hold it against them tho. I would've been the same
11/03/2020, 11:48 - Bee: Thank you for praying, Nischal :)
11/03/2020, 11:51 - Bee: You typed just the right amount.
11/03/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: When you say kids... Do you mean college kids? Otherwise why are you teaching kids about drugs...
11/03/2020, 14:21 - Bee: They are second year nursing students... Not kids kids. But kids
11/03/2020, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Look at you calling them kids 😂. Yea I get it though. Everyone I meet at the CU are kids
11/03/2020, 15:32 - Bee: 😂. The students of the college I went to today have postings in the same hospital that I go to. So I know some of them...and they call me Didi/chechi (I don't know why) so calling them kids just fits
11/03/2020, 15:33 - Bee: You're the oldie Nischal
11/03/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Old but not the most mature. So what's your plans for the evening?
11/03/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Just finished dinner. I'll head to bed early tonight
11/03/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Thank you for taking time out to message, Nischal. It means a lot to me.
11/03/2020, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'm happy that you are Debby :)
11/03/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Got CU today and it'll probably be short
11/03/2020, 16:34 - Bee: How come?
11/03/2020, 16:36 - Bee: I hope you have a meaningful fun time anyway
11/03/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
11/03/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: There's some other event after that the committee people are attending.
11/03/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: I hope to enjoy whatever time is there. It's probably for the best since I should head home and finish assignments 😅
11/03/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I hope you get good sleep tonight :)
11/03/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Thank you. I know I will
11/03/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Bye!
11/03/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Byeeee
12/03/2020, 07:54 - Bee: Heyyyyyyyyy
12/03/2020, 07:54 - Bee: Bible study today!!!
12/03/2020, 07:54 - Bee: And your meet with your professor
12/03/2020, 07:55 - Bee: Praying for you and hoping you have a goooood day. :)
12/03/2020, 07:57 - Bee: Also, it is Shirly Aunty's birthday today. I know you remember but just in case
12/03/2020, 07:57 - Bee: Bye!
12/03/2020, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! CU ended up being short as expected. But I did manage to submit two assignments which is 2 more than 0 so I'm happy about that 😁
12/03/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Yay!
12/03/2020, 12:47 - Bee: I had a quiet day at the hospital... I'm not as tired as I usually am
12/03/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Feels good
12/03/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😌. The Corona virus thing is affecting things here. There's no college till the end of the month from tomorrow on
12/03/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: But worst of all the climbing gym may be closed 😭
12/03/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: But Bible study is still on. Excited for that! My guide meeting has been shifted to Fridays now
12/03/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the reminder... I did call Ma up in the morning itself cause I didn't want to end up being too busy to call later in the day
12/03/2020, 16:06 - Bee: This is a relief. You'll still have submissions through the month tho right?
12/03/2020, 16:07 - Bee: All for good, Nischal!!
12/03/2020, 16:07 - Bee: That's good. So you're going to college once a week now? Or you're going anyway?
12/03/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Goodnight. :))))
13/03/2020, 00:25 - Nischal Abraham: I do have submissions all through. And a load of work to be done too! Not so much of a relief really 😅
13/03/2020, 00:27 - Nischal Abraham: Well climbing was still open! I couldn't climb too well today but the Bible study was crazy blessed today Debby!!! I wish you were here. If you get the opportunity to study the book of Jude please do. It's tremendously encouraging
13/03/2020, 00:27 - Nischal Abraham: So I won't be going to college at all for the rest of the month at least. Will probably be Skype calling the guide
13/03/2020, 00:28 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! I hope you have a blessed wonderful day today. I just got back from the Bible study so will be heading to bed soon
13/03/2020, 00:29 - Nischal Abraham: If there's one good thing that's come out of all the precaution here... It's that I've got an insane amount of time available to talk to you now. I hope you don't end up thinking it's too much 😂😂
13/03/2020, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy!
13/03/2020, 11:43 - Bee: HI NISCHALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
13/03/2020, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day's going well. How's the situation there with the virus and all
13/03/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Oh hi!!!!
13/03/2020, 11:43 - Bee: My day was busy. Went to another college for the research thing
13/03/2020, 11:44 - Bee: The situation isn't any different for me... But the hospital is running out of masks
13/03/2020, 11:45 - Bee: And MGM has a newly built isolated ward for the pandemic
13/03/2020, 11:45 - Bee: Nothing else I think
13/03/2020, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh. How's your research thing progressing?
13/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: I hope I'm not given holidays Nischal. Because that would be cut from my May holidays and study leave
13/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: It is progressing. Still two months of work to do but it's going somewhere at least
13/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: How's your day going?
13/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: You have to tell me about it!!!
13/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: I did have a blessed wonderful day. Looking forward to the rest of the day at homw
13/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: Home*
13/03/2020, 11:48 - Bee: There's a lesser chance of you getting infected with the virus. That's the good thing!!
13/03/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: I was hoping for the same thing. Holidays aren't really a good thing anymore in life 😅. Now all our assignments have to be handed in without any lectures to teach us
13/03/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Been alright today. It's a bright sunny day outside but I'm sure it'll be cold if I had to head out
13/03/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: I've got all the notes saved up so definitely someday
13/03/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done for the day already? Heading home?
13/03/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: It is indeed
13/03/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Yes that was the second thought which came to my mind
13/03/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Have more flowers bloomed?
13/03/2020, 11:57 - Bee: Did you save me one?
13/03/2020, 11:57 - Bee: Adding it to the possible list
13/03/2020, 11:57 - Bee: Yes and yes. Waiting for the bus
13/03/2020, 11:58 - Bee: What's for lunch?
13/03/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Rice and carrots and beans and stuff
13/03/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Still the same trees
13/03/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: I have not Debby. I'll be honest I feel bad plucking flowers off the trees. I will definitely pluck up the courage to do it though
13/03/2020, 12:08 - Bee: Nooo don't do something you don't want to. I'll just take a dark grainy photo with my grandmother's phone :P
13/03/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. It's the best type of photos if you ask me
13/03/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Ummmmm I that's what you believe then whose going to click profile picture worthy photos of me
13/03/2020, 12:15 - Bee: If*
13/03/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: Selfies seem to be the trend last I checked. But that was actually a couple of years ago... Also if you're expecting good photos from me I don't think I'll be able to match expectation 😶

13/03/2020, 12:42 - Bee: Yes. Sunday after worship
13/03/2020, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a fun time for you girls 😊. I need to check up on buses and see if they're running on Sunday otherwise I may just miss worship
13/03/2020, 13:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 13:24 - Bee: No red velvet. We're making chocolate cupcakes
13/03/2020, 13:24 - Bee: Oh. Can you check online? Or will you have to go to the bus stop
13/03/2020, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's cute
13/03/2020, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Chocolate is nice too
13/03/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: I can check online. Everything is online here
13/03/2020, 15:00 - Bee: I'm not very fond of chocolate. But the majority are

13/03/2020, 15:00 - Bee: We're in majiwada

13/03/2020, 15:01 - Bee: It was my first time in traffic and a red light
13/03/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Papa was holding on to that side handle (does it have a name?) the whole time
13/03/2020, 15:02 - Bee: What's up?
13/03/2020, 15:02 - Bee: We went to the grocery store before Majiwada. And people are stocking up Nischal!! 😯
13/03/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome!!
13/03/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds stressful. Hope you got through it 😁
13/03/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: It's called a hand brake
13/03/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Because of the virus? I saw a lot of that here yesterday but didn't think Mumbai would be that affected
13/03/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Nooo the one on the door
13/03/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Yes. I didn't either
13/03/2020, 15:13 - Bee: I think I did
13/03/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh haha that one. I think that's just a handle then :P
13/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Better by Pat Barrett
https://open.spotify.com/track/6f2YcFaM5NaDoKbKyMwiCm?si=C9d7Y7jISRW5i6lCIK9QFQ
13/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Oh
13/03/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Don't worry Debby. As with all things just keep practicing and you'll be fine 😊
13/03/2020, 15:33 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal
13/03/2020, 15:33 - Bee: What do you believe about giving alms to beggars Nischal
13/03/2020, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: My actions aren't really backed by anything other than growing up in Mumbai. I don't directly give any money to beggars on the street
13/03/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Okay
13/03/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Just asking
13/03/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Nischal
13/03/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Goodnight :)
13/03/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I don't know how your day's going to be tomorrow but I hope it's a good one :)
14/03/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)))
14/03/2020, 07:31 - Bee: How was the rest of your day?
14/03/2020, 08:07 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Nothing eventful happened for the rest of the day. Sitting at home doesn't really translate to a lot of activities happening
14/03/2020, 11:39 - Bee: Hey :)
14/03/2020, 11:40 - Bee: Are the buses running?
14/03/2020, 11:40 - Bee: How many submissions you have until there's college again?
14/03/2020, 11:41 - Bee: My cousin and his family are coming over for dinner. He has an adorable 10 month old. The best part about dinner is getting to carry her
14/03/2020, 11:41 - Bee: Her name is Eliana too
14/03/2020, 11:41 - Bee: What's for lunch?
14/03/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. But Fairview called off meeting for this week as a precaution
14/03/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Too many :(
14/03/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Same as yesterday. Probably add eggs in there today
14/03/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a fun evening 😊. And tomorrow's going to be a busy day for you too!
14/03/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Oh nooo
14/03/2020, 13:07 - Bee: We bought a 100 small paper teacups yesterday. For the wine
14/03/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Yes!! I'm going over to Reenee's after dinner to make a photo booth thing
14/03/2020, 13:08 - Bee: There's no Sunday school in Dharamveer Nagar tomorrow... I don't know why. I'll ask Amaresh bhaiyya tomorrow
14/03/2020, 13:08 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
14/03/2020, 13:10 - Bee: What's up?
14/03/2020, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Won't paper get soggy?
14/03/2020, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Probably because of the virus situation
14/03/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... I'm missing out 🙁
14/03/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright. Sitting at home all day never does me any good. And it's a rainy moody day today too
14/03/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: Just got done with lunch and now I'm in my room. What about you?
14/03/2020, 14:45 - Bee: Those are the same as Sunday gospel teacups
14/03/2020, 14:45 - Bee: Yes. But we've been told to prepare for next week
14/03/2020, 14:46 - Bee: That's for the bachelorette... You probably wouldn't have been invited had you been here :P Ashley Jason Rolf aren't there
14/03/2020, 14:46 - Bee: Final prep for dinner. Almost done. Waiting for them to arrive now
14/03/2020, 15:02 - Bee: Make a list?
14/03/2020, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea I forget dinners are late there 😂. What's for dinner?
14/03/2020, 15:11 - Bee: There's pulav, chicken curry, pork, dal, some salad, idlis, bread
14/03/2020, 15:11 - Bee: Wait there are no vegetables!!!
14/03/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds Irish if there's no vegetables 😋
14/03/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: But I'd love to eat all of it!
14/03/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Come!!!
14/03/2020, 15:23 - Bee: The pork is really good. It's a Mangalorean recipe
14/03/2020, 15:24 - Bee: My friend just called. A Covid-19 patient just came to MGM. A few of my friends are on night shift there. I'm worried :(((((
14/03/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well it was bound to happen at some point in the hospital right... And from what I've heard it's just a flu that comes and goes for most people our age
14/03/2020, 16:10 - Bee: True
14/03/2020, 16:15 - Bee: I don't want to bring the virus home that's all
14/03/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's fair
14/03/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I hope you had a good day :). Praying for your tomorrow
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Hey :)
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Dinner was fun
14/03/2020, 18:54 - Bee: I'm at Reenee's now. Working on a photo booth thingy for tomorrow
14/03/2020, 18:55 - Bee: But it may not even happen. Teena is down with fever. She'll let us know tomorrow morning of she's coming or not
14/03/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Are you going to sleep?
14/03/2020, 18:55 - Bee: How's your day been so far?
14/03/2020, 18:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 18:56 - Bee: *.
14/03/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I thought you might be since it's pretty late. And I didn't want to disturb you while you're working on tomorrow
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! I hope she's okay
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: I think you do 😂
14/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Uneventful. I feel that's going to be my answer for the next 2 weeks
14/03/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome
14/03/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be staying over at Reenee's?
14/03/2020, 19:48 - Bee: I hope so too
14/03/2020, 19:48 - Bee: It was supposed to be a full stop
But okay
14/03/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: I know. It was a joke
14/03/2020, 19:49 - Bee: From what I've seen you're not an uneventful week kinda person
14/03/2020, 19:49 - Bee: You prefer activity
14/03/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Yes
14/03/2020, 19:50 - Bee: I'll go home early in the morning. 6:30ish
14/03/2020, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: I've had plenty of uneventful weeks before. I just don't enjoy them :P
14/03/2020, 19:55 - Bee: What do you do then?
14/03/2020, 19:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>

14/03/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Okay
14/03/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Nope. Pinterest
14/03/2020, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: Still looks awesome!! Are you guys going to stay up all night?
14/03/2020, 20:20 - Bee: I hope not
14/03/2020, 20:20 - Bee: Going to sleep in 10
14/03/2020, 20:20 - Bee: What about you?
14/03/2020, 20:22 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be awake for a while
14/03/2020, 20:23 - Nischal Abraham: I was thinking of checking if Maynooth community church is still gathering tomorrow
14/03/2020, 20:38 - Bee: Oh
14/03/2020, 20:38 - Bee: Who's the friend if yours who goes there?

14/03/2020, 20:44 - Bee: Around my 9ish?
14/03/2020, 20:44 - Bee: Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
14/03/2020, 20:44 - Bee: We can plan around it
14/03/2020, 20:46 - Bee: Bye

14/03/2020, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: I hate my terrible memory :/
15/03/2020, 01:08 - Bee: It's okay
15/03/2020, 01:08 - Bee: Not important
15/03/2020, 09:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>

15/03/2020, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: It is beautifully done 😊. Looks like a wedding dress to me. Sounds like you guys had a fun time! 
Did you sleep in the afternoon since you have no Sunday school?
15/03/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi!! 😂. That ring looks way too big for her hand
15/03/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Yay! It is a wedding dress
15/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: I'm still here. Cleaning up the place
15/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: There's no gospel meeting either
15/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: :(
15/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Doesn't feel like a Sunday Nischal
15/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: 😂
15/03/2020, 11:25 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/03/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: I know that feeling. I'd prefer a Sunday in the week.

15/03/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: Incredible really. I think it's really sweet you did that for them ☺
15/03/2020, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: This one looks like you're singing
15/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: They mean a lot to us
15/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: It's the least we could do
15/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: 😂
15/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: I don't remember if I was
15/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: What's up?
15/03/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'm trying to convince myself that I need to go to the shop to buy stuff
15/03/2020, 12:01 - Bee: Go!!
15/03/2020, 12:02 - Bee: What if stuff runs out
15/03/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Then I'll have to find alternate stuff. I mean I just need food. So if one type of food isn't there I'll just get something else
15/03/2020, 12:15 - Bee: I'm walking back home
15/03/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Can I call you?

15/03/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Don't be
15/03/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I should be :)
15/03/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Okay :)

15/03/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Okay
15/03/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Debby
15/03/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Hi
15/03/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Call?
16/03/2020, 06:36 - Bee: Nischal. I want to tell you those two things. I don't know when we'll meet and I want to tell you as soon as I can
16/03/2020, 06:36 - Bee: Can we talk for a bit today?
16/03/2020, 08:49 - Nischal Abraham: We can definitely talk today... even if you had nothing to tell me
16/03/2020, 09:47 - Bee: Your 10:30?
16/03/2020, 09:47 - Bee: My 4?
16/03/2020, 09:48 - Nischal Abraham: You mean in 40 min?
16/03/2020, 09:49 - Nischal Abraham: Could we make it your 4:30? I should be done with breakfast by then 😅
16/03/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Yes
16/03/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Yes yes
16/03/2020, 09:49 - Bee: 4:30
16/03/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: 👍🏼. I look forward to it
16/03/2020, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
16/03/2020, 11:02 - Bee: Hi
16/03/2020, 11:03 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free when you are
16/03/2020, 11:11 - Bee: I'm free
16/03/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: So am I
16/03/2020, 11:12 - Bee: I'll call?
16/03/2020, 15:46 - Bee: Hi
16/03/2020, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
16/03/2020, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up having a late lunch. How was driving?
16/03/2020, 16:18 - Bee: What was for lunch?
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Omlette and bread
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Bee: Driving was okay. Parking in our tough parking spot wasn't okay. I added a few more scratches. It's a huge patch because of the wall I hit :(
Papa wasn't bothered by it and seemed almost proud because this attempt was better than the last
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I'm having dinner now
16/03/2020, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh enjoy dinner. Did you do the slope thing?
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Bee: I did. Not intentionally tho. I got stuck on a slope. I got out of it but I don't remember how
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Bee: I did something with the clutch and accelerator
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Bee: We went to visit this family whos been coming for the gospel meeting for a while now
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like the only way I know to get out of it
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Bee: I'll tell you about it when we talk
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Bee: I don't remember what I did tho. Half or full cutch and half or full accelerator
16/03/2020, 16:30 - Bee: 🤷🏻‍♀
16/03/2020, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Added to the list
16/03/2020, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Well whatever the case may be you got out of it! 😁
16/03/2020, 16:41 - Bee: Yes
16/03/2020, 16:41 - Bee: I have holidays until the 31st
16/03/2020, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that is long. Would that affect your college?
16/03/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Yes. I may not get summer holidays or study leave
16/03/2020, 16:43 - Bee: :(
16/03/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Good thing there was no Delhi plan
16/03/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea. I guess that worked itself out. You'll just have to consider this to be your summer vacation
16/03/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Yes
16/03/2020, 16:50 - Bee: But I can't go play with kids or visit the elderly
16/03/2020, 16:57 - Bee: It's okay. I've got other ways to spend my two weeks wisely
16/03/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes. Both of those must be avoided right now. You could spend a lot more time doing stuff at home! Cook some new dishes
16/03/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Yes!!! That's one of the things I'll be doing
16/03/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: What was for dinner?
16/03/2020, 17:04 - Bee: Dal, rice, methi vegetable, and salad
16/03/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good! I haven't had a two side dish meal in a while
16/03/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Now's the time
16/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: If you want to call and talk or call and not talk any time tell me okay
16/03/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Talk about food?
16/03/2020, 17:44 - Bee: If you want to
16/03/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Just to clarify. You mean today right? Not like a this month is the time to call
16/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Why is this month not a time to call?
16/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Today or tomorrow or whenever
16/03/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you aren't too sleepy already then I'd love to call if you're okay with it
16/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: I'd love to too
16/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Give me 5
16/03/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Let me know when you're free
16/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Yes brv
16/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Brb
16/03/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Hi
16/03/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hii
16/03/2020, 18:13 - Bee: I'll call?

16/03/2020, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
16/03/2020, 20:20 - Bee: I'll call?
16/03/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Sure
17/03/2020, 10:08 - Bee: Hi Nischal
17/03/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Hope you're having a fun time and have taken at least one video for Ankush's sake
17/03/2020, 20:43 - Nischal Abraham: It was quite the adventure! I'm exhausted but it was super fun. I'll tell you all about it when we talk. Didn't even get a video in the end 😂
18/03/2020, 00:21 - Bee: What nooooo
18/03/2020, 00:21 - Bee: Poor Ankush
18/03/2020, 08:30 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the day?
18/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Hey :)
18/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: I had to go to college today to fill my exam form. On my way back home now
18/03/2020, 11:23 - Bee: What's up?
18/03/2020, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's cool. I'm recovering from exhaustion😅
18/03/2020, 12:51 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about it :)
18/03/2020, 12:51 - Bee: What's for lunch?
18/03/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Egg sandwich
18/03/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: When will you reach home?
18/03/2020, 13:12 - Bee: What are you doing now?
18/03/2020, 13:13 - Bee: I just  reached home. I dropped by Amaresh Bhaiyya's place on my way back to pick up Sunday school stuff
18/03/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'm heading downstairs to prepare lunch
18/03/2020, 13:14 - Bee: Cool
18/03/2020, 13:14 - Bee: What're you going to make?
18/03/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: :P
18/03/2020, 13:16 - Bee: Oh waaiiitt
18/03/2020, 13:16 - Bee: I thought you already had lunch
18/03/2020, 13:16 - Bee: And you're talking about dinner here. And I never questioned why you're having dinner so early. Even I haven't had dinner yet!!
18/03/2020, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
18/03/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Well it is an Irish dinner so you're not wrong
18/03/2020, 14:00 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/03/2020, 14:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
18/03/2020, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: Day's going well so far. Just been in my room for most of it
18/03/2020, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been?
18/03/2020, 17:12 - Bee: Hey :)
18/03/2020, 17:12 - Bee: It was tiring. 
And I've been given so many assignments. There's something to submit everyday. Finished one. One more has to be done today
18/03/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Assignments for me too! I guess they couldn't just give you a holiday so it sort of makes sense
18/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Yes. I hope this means I'll still get may holidays. But who knows how the situation is going to be then
18/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Will you be free in an hour and a half or so?
18/03/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I will ve
18/03/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Be*
18/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Can we talk?
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yes we can :). Look forward to it
18/03/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Me tooooooo
18/03/2020, 18:56 - Bee: I'm going to need more time Nischal
18/03/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time Debby. It's okay if you're too busy today we can talk tomorrow
18/03/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: But I'm here whenever you're free
18/03/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Finished the assignment. I'll take a quick shower and then call
18/03/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Cool
18/03/2020, 20:00 - Bee: Nischal
18/03/2020, 20:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
18/03/2020, 20:00 - Bee: I'll call?
18/03/2020, 20:01 - Nischal Abraham: Sure
19/03/2020, 06:18 - Bee: Dude
19/03/2020, 07:57 - Bee: Bb
19/03/2020, 08:09 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning
19/03/2020, 08:09 - Nischal Abraham: Did you manage breakfast?
19/03/2020, 08:24 - Bee: To your
19/03/2020, 08:24 - Bee: You*
19/03/2020, 08:24 - Bee: Yes
Ham sandwiches and coffee
19/03/2020, 08:27 - Bee: I went back to sleep after
19/03/2020, 09:18 - Nischal Abraham: Sound like a lovely breakfast. Will you be sleeping now as well?
19/03/2020, 09:29 - Bee: Nope. I have an assignment to be submitted by 4:30
19/03/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Hope you manage to complete it!
19/03/2020, 10:30 - Bee: I hope so too
19/03/2020, 11:05 - Bee: What are you up to?
19/03/2020, 11:05 - Bee: I haven't completed it
A last minute research thing came up
Because the colleges who are a part of our sample have holidays too
19/03/2020, 11:34 - Nischal Abraham: Oh so you don't have to submit it today?
19/03/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished cleaning the bathroom. Now I'll go take a bath and then work on homework
19/03/2020, 11:35 - Bee: I do. :(
19/03/2020, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: Well better late than never. Is there a lot more to be completed?
19/03/2020, 11:58 - Bee: I just finished!!!
19/03/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! That wasn't too much later. So done with assignments for the day?
19/03/2020, 11:59 - Bee: Yes :S
19/03/2020, 12:00 - Bee: Oops
19/03/2020, 12:00 - Bee: I meant :D
19/03/2020, 12:00 - Bee: I don't know what :S is
19/03/2020, 12:00 - Bee: But I think that is something. I've seen it in my t9 days
19/03/2020, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: I don't either. But you could always invent a definition for it
19/03/2020, 12:00 - Bee: One day
19/03/2020, 12:01 - Bee: Are you doing your assignments now?
19/03/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. At least for the next hour
19/03/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Cool. I'm going to take a nap
19/03/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
19/03/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Hey
19/03/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: How was your nap?
19/03/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Longer than I thought it would be
19/03/2020, 16:40 - Nischal Abraham: Well you had sleep to catch up on
19/03/2020, 16:41 - Bee: Yes. Im well rested now. Trying to get Ashley to come for a walk with me
19/03/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: At this time of night? Had dinner yet?
19/03/2020, 16:45 - Bee: Yes and yes
19/03/2020, 16:45 - Bee: It must be so pleasant outside
19/03/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: It probably is... Enjoy your walk :P
19/03/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Still working on this
19/03/2020, 16:51 - Bee: Maa wont let me go alone
19/03/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Well if he's working tomorrow I can understand if he doesn't want to go
19/03/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Hi isnt. He has the next 3 days off
19/03/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Wouldn't you rather just go for an early morning walk?
19/03/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Any time of the day is fine by me really
19/03/2020, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: So what brings about a night walk?
19/03/2020, 16:59 - Bee: I am wide awake. And I didn't step out of the house today
19/03/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. Fair enough. I didn't step out of the house today either. I'd have joined you if I could've
19/03/2020, 17:01 - Bee: That would've been amazing
19/03/2020, 17:01 - Bee: I was just thinking that
19/03/2020, 17:02 - Bee: But you don't live in the vasant vihar area
19/03/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Nope... I'm not in that area 😂
19/03/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Well we're meant to be quarantined anyway. Maybe take the opportunity to walk around home!
19/03/2020, 17:04 - Bee: 😂
19/03/2020, 17:04 - Bee: But I'm not there Nischal
19/03/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Not where? I meant your home
19/03/2020, 17:12 - Bee: Oh
19/03/2020, 17:12 - Bee: I was talking about you
19/03/2020, 17:12 - Bee: What's up?
19/03/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Started the second movie for lotr. Turns out it's just as long as the first one... I'll probably be watching it in parts
19/03/2020, 17:13 - Bee: I'll not go tonight. I'll ask Ashley to come with me in the morning
19/03/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Oh
19/03/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Is it interesting?
19/03/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know when I'm done with the third part.
19/03/2020, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'd say he'd be more agreeable to that offer
19/03/2020, 17:15 - Bee: Third movie?
19/03/2020, 17:15 - Bee: What if he doesn't wake up
19/03/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. So far I'd say it is interesting. But my interest in watching all of it is more because it's become so popular. I want to see why
19/03/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Well you'll have to try waking him up then. Play football with him or something he'll get up fine 😂
19/03/2020, 17:22 - Bee: 😂 I'll come back with aches in muscles I never knew I had
19/03/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: You'd be fine. You're fit enough. Btw when did you finally get up?
19/03/2020, 17:28 - Bee: Right before the Bible study
19/03/2020, 17:29 - Bee: I'm not fit Nischal. I've been doing the house work since I've been at home and I get tired very easily
Probably another reason why I wanted to go for a walk
19/03/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Ill just go tomorrow morning
19/03/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Start afresh in the morning. So how has your day been?
19/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: It was alright. Kinda productive. I feel like I overslept tho.
19/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: How's your day been?
19/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Still watching the movie?
19/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: I'll just message later then
19/03/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: My days been kinda productive too!
19/03/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: No no. I'm free to talk. The movie's a side thing anyway
19/03/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Second movies in trilogies are only for build up
19/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: LOTR is a trilogy? I thought there were some 5-6 movies
19/03/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yea the Hobbit is supposed to be a prequel of sorts
19/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Didn't the Hobbit come out after Lotr though?
19/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: 🤷🏻‍♀
19/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: I've been drinking too much iced tea
19/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Finished two packets in a month and a half
19/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Switching to lemon water now.
19/03/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. As movies tend to do they're sometimes in the order they're released
19/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Did you/will you go grocery shopping?
19/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Oh
19/03/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Not today. Maybe tomorrow
19/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Okay
19/03/2020, 18:07 - Bee: I want to go to Sanjay gandhi Nischal
19/03/2020, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Would they be open at this time?
19/03/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Not right now
19/03/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Tomorrow morning
19/03/2020, 18:08 - Bee: But the borivali entrance is closed because of the virus
19/03/2020, 18:08 - Bee: I don't know if it'll be open here
19/03/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yea by this time I meant in the morning 😂
19/03/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: But because of the virus wouldn't it be closed here too?
19/03/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Probably
19/03/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Oh. I thought you meant right now
19/03/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you couldn't go for a walk I doubt you'd be allowed for a trek
19/03/2020, 18:20 - Bee: Yes
19/03/2020, 18:20 - Bee: After everything settles down then
19/03/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: What're you doing?
19/03/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Lying down. Not sleepy. Thinking of watching something. Don't know what though
19/03/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Want to talk?
19/03/2020, 18:29 - Bee: Aren't you watching a movie?
19/03/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: It's far too long to watch in one go
19/03/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: .
19/03/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Yes
19/03/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Do you?
19/03/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yes! I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to
19/03/2020, 18:37 - Bee: I'll call now?
19/03/2020, 18:38 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
19/03/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
19/03/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Okay
20/03/2020, 06:24 - Bee: Bb
20/03/2020, 08:41 - Bee: Bb
20/03/2020, 10:58 - Bee: Nischal
What's the easiest way to transfer files from one laptop to another?
20/03/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Move it into a harddrive and then onto the other laptop? But if it's a smaller file then using Google drive is an option
20/03/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: I feel old but what's this supposed to mean? 😅
20/03/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Not much
20/03/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Hmmmm. I don't have a hard drive
20/03/2020, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: Wait what... Are you saying it doesn't mean much or it stands for not much
20/03/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Oh it doesn't mean much
20/03/2020, 13:16 - Bee: It sounds different in my head. I'll tell you why I said it when we talk. It'll just sound stupid when I say it out loud though
20/03/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: You could try using Google drive then. It allows you to store upto 15 GB
20/03/2020, 13:19 - Bee: Its some 70 GB
20/03/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh. Yea then HD drive is the way to go. I guess if you have a high storage pen drive that may work too
20/03/2020, 13:22 - Bee: I'll ask Reenee if she has a hard drive
20/03/2020, 15:10 - Bee: Reenee had one. Got it from her
20/03/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. How's your day going?
20/03/2020, 15:52 - Bee: Going good. I went for a walk in the morning. Finished a few assignments during the day. Went for a drive with papa. Another walk but this time with Reenee. And just had a lot of left over frosting from Sunday
20/03/2020, 15:52 - Bee: How's your day going?
20/03/2020, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: Not nearly as many walks in mine. Its been an okay day so far. Got on a call with Megha and Ankush. Spoke to my parents
20/03/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yep that's all of it
20/03/2020, 16:10 - Bee: Is Megha the one doing her PhD?
20/03/2020, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yep that's her. She's in Germany at the moment
20/03/2020, 16:19 - Bee: Oh. How is she doing? With the pandemic and all
20/03/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yea she's stuck at home as well... She was planning on travelling to Mumbai in April but that's cancelled now
20/03/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Aw :( at least she's okay health-wise
20/03/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's true. Well I'm hoping we'll have a lot more time for interaction now that we're always at home 😂
20/03/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Yes! Call people up, Nischal!
20/03/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Well at this time of the night you're the only person who'd want to be called
20/03/2020, 17:28 - Bee: I'm sure Arpitha would be up too
20/03/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: !!
20/03/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: I completely forgot again!
20/03/2020, 17:32 - Bee: NISCHAL!!!
20/03/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Yes?
20/03/2020, 17:32 - Bee: !!
20/03/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well I sent here a message now. I'll probably just talk to her tomorrow
20/03/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Okay
20/03/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Had dinner?
20/03/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Yes
20/03/2020, 17:38 - Bee: There was rice and a mixed vegetable curry
20/03/2020, 17:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: 🙁
20/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: But it opens in the newer one
20/03/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Is there anything I can do?
20/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: So that it opens
20/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: It's a new hard drive
Never used before
20/03/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not too sure. Is it password protected?
20/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: I don't think so
20/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: .
20/03/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yes but even if it's new you can usually set a password. But it's hard to say what the problem is without being there. I'd try reconnecting it to the old one
20/03/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: But if that doesn't work then you'll probably need the help of someone who knows how to work those things
20/03/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Oh
20/03/2020, 17:52 - Bee: What do you mean by reconnecting it to the old one?
20/03/2020, 17:52 - Bee: You're the only person I know who knows computers Nischal
20/03/2020, 17:53 - Bee: It's okay then
20/03/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I meant unplug and plug in again
20/03/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: If you can figure it out, format the hard drive on the old computer. If it's already empty then it shouldn't matter
20/03/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: And the new computer will probably be able to recognise it
20/03/2020, 17:56 - Bee: It's working in the new one
Not working in the old one
20/03/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I know. That's why do this on the old one
20/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Okay I will try it
20/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: I did it
20/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Still wasn't happening
20/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Ashley called one of his friends and has done something. He said it'll take some time
20/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Now we wait
20/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal
20/03/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Expect a lot more computer related doubts.
20/03/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. I'd help out more if I was there but a lot of what I'd do is just trial and error 😂
20/03/2020, 18:15 - Bee: That's more than what I do!!
20/03/2020, 18:33 - Bee: What's up?
20/03/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing at all. Watching the evening light take over. I'll have to switch on my light soon
20/03/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Did the hard drive work finally?
20/03/2020, 18:37 - Bee: No it's still happening
20/03/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Sounds pleasant
20/03/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: It's a quiet evening. What's your plans for tomorrow?
20/03/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Going for a walk in the morning with Reenee. And then working on tomorrow's submissions. Nothing else really
I'm kinda getting tired of being home so long Nischal
20/03/2020, 18:43 - Bee: I can't even go play with kids
20/03/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. This isn't a pleasant homestay. It isn't supposed to be... Maybe start a new book to read?
20/03/2020, 18:48 - Bee: I could. I haven't continued the Chronicles of Narnia
20/03/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Do you play Quizup?
20/03/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Used to when I was in college
20/03/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: But like most other games I stopped playing after a while
20/03/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Oh. I played for a year and then stopped. Restarted again because of boredom
20/03/2020, 18:59 - Bee: What are you doing?
20/03/2020, 19:00 - Bee: If you don't mind, can you send a photo of yourself/your face
20/03/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Feels like I haven't seen you in long
20/03/2020, 19:00 - Bee: It's okay if you don't also
20/03/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: You saw me just a few days back in video call! If anything it's your face that I haven't seen in a while 😂
20/03/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well I don't look the most flattering at the moment. But you've reminded me to ask for photos from Megan so I'll do just that now
20/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: That's a long time ago
20/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Okay
20/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: You're not asking to see my face 🤷🏻‍♀
20/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: This statement sounds wrong but I don't know why
20/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Grammatically
20/03/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds correct to me
20/03/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Cool

20/03/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's me today :P
20/03/2020, 19:13 - Bee: This is my favorite out of the lot
20/03/2020, 19:13 - Bee: The place looks beautiful 😍
20/03/2020, 19:13 - Bee: I didn't take you as the type of person who takes screenshots during a video call
20/03/2020, 19:14 - Bee: I'm gonna go to sleep
20/03/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: It was a rare video call. Pictures are memories 😁
20/03/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Late bedtime tonight as well. I hope you're sleeping okay Debby
20/03/2020, 19:15 - Bee: I hope so too
20/03/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Bye!
20/03/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby!
21/03/2020, 04:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 04:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 04:24 - Bee: Started the day with this
21/03/2020, 04:25 - Bee: It's a filter btw
21/03/2020, 04:28 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 04:29 - Bee: Look at those photogenic faces
21/03/2020, 04:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. That's awesome. Those filters look extremely life-like 😮. Especially that first pic
21/03/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: I thought it was face paint
21/03/2020, 09:34 - Bee: Video calls on Instagram have filters
21/03/2020, 09:36 - Bee: What's up?
21/03/2020, 09:36 - Nischal Abraham: Finished with breakfast. I made a plan for the day. Hoping I'll be able to stick to it
21/03/2020, 09:36 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh and Daniel invited me for dinner 😁
21/03/2020, 09:37 - Bee: Oh! How are you going to get there?
21/03/2020, 09:38 - Bee: Is there a phonecall with me in the plan? Could you add it?
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: What're you up to now?
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: He'll come pick me up
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Okay
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Bee: I'm having lunch
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Just to talk. Nothing particular
21/03/2020, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Late lunch isn't it? I'd love to talk. We'll have to plan a time though. Daniel will pick me up sometime after lunch. And then I'll only be back home late.
So I think it'll be better if we talk before I go
21/03/2020, 09:42 - Bee: Is your 10:30 okay?
21/03/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good
21/03/2020, 10:30 - Bee: Nischal
21/03/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
21/03/2020, 10:34 - Bee: I'll call?
21/03/2020, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
21/03/2020, 11:11 - Bee: Nischal
21/03/2020, 11:11 - Bee: Missed voice call
21/03/2020, 11:11 - Bee: You're on another call
21/03/2020, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jai7WW-Qqjk
21/03/2020, 14:28 - Bee: Aren't beavers the ones who build dams?!
21/03/2020, 14:28 - Bee: 😂
21/03/2020, 14:28 - Bee: This is me when I have to meet the word count
21/03/2020, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yep they are
21/03/2020, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly! 😂
21/03/2020, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: They have 2 other PowerPoint related videos as well
21/03/2020, 14:31 - Bee: I'll watch them too
21/03/2020, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: Did you read their pinned comment? Jaxon didn't know what was on the slides and that's why he's laughing so much
21/03/2020, 14:31 - Bee: I didn't
21/03/2020, 14:31 - Bee: Which one is Jaxon?
21/03/2020, 14:31 - Bee: OH. I thought that was part of the skit!!
21/03/2020, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: The long haired chubby one 😂
21/03/2020, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: One the left
21/03/2020, 14:32 - Bee: Because usually I find everything is funny during presentations
21/03/2020, 14:32 - Bee: 😂
21/03/2020, 14:32 - Bee: More reasonable explanation
21/03/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/N8TUB2IgjmU
21/03/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: I found this to be the funniest of the 3
21/03/2020, 15:46 - Bee: The one on beans is hilarious too!!
21/03/2020, 15:47 - Bee: Have an amazing time with Daniel and fam, Nischal. :)
21/03/2020, 16:59 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. She's so tiny!
21/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: She is
21/03/2020, 17:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: I did not. Keeping my hands clean Debby
22/03/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Hi Nischal
22/03/2020, 16:51 - Bee: My day was alright
22/03/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Bye!
22/03/2020, 16:52 - Bee: :)
22/03/2020, 16:52 - Bee: How's yours going?
22/03/2020, 16:53 - Bee: Bye!
22/03/2020, 19:21 - Bee: I was on Instagram and got an account suggestion
Name : Radhika Rajvanshi
Mutual friend : Nischal Abraham
I'm assuming this is the Radhika.
Morbid curiosity led me to click on the account.
And now there's a face to the name.
This is me trying not to bottle it up.

Hope you're okay. Bye
23/03/2020, 05:10 - Bee: Nischal I'm okay.
23/03/2020, 05:11 - Bee: Please don't think/worry about this.
23/03/2020, 11:21 - Bee: Haven't heard from you in a while. I hope you're okay...
23/03/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I'm doing fine. Was avoiding WhatsApp for a while... Sorry for being out of touch yesterday. 

I'm glad to hear you're okay 😊. That is Radhika... And your curiosity is understandable. I hope your day's going well today too!
23/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: It is. :)
23/03/2020, 14:50 - Bee: Hey!
23/03/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. Got an online lecture going on right now
23/03/2020, 15:22 - Bee: Okay. Bye!
23/03/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hi!
23/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Hey
23/03/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: You're awake! I was almost certain you'd gone to bed already
23/03/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: How has your day been?
23/03/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Yes heading to bed in a minute
23/03/2020, 17:55 - Bee: My day was alright
23/03/2020, 17:55 - Bee: How's yours going?
23/03/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Well I had a lecture today. It's been a good day so far though. Need to spend more time out of my room
23/03/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Too late to head out now?
23/03/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I meant I really needed it and finally did today
23/03/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: I spent all of yesterday in the room and it gets really drab just sitting in bed all day
23/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Oh
23/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: I thought you might have had a busy Sunday
23/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: That's good!!
23/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: I'm going to bed...
23/03/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
23/03/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! Enjoy good sleep :)
23/03/2020, 18:05 - Bee: You too!
23/03/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Well I've got a while to go
24/03/2020, 09:42 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby!
24/03/2020, 09:42 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up enjoying too much sleep
24/03/2020, 10:19 - Bee: 😂
24/03/2020, 10:19 - Bee: How are you?
24/03/2020, 10:19 - Bee: What's for breakfast?
24/03/2020, 10:19 - Bee: What's up?
24/03/2020, 10:19 - Bee: I finished assignments for today and I have time for a nap!! 😌
24/03/2020, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm well. All plans to go out have been cancelled for this week except shopping. Had cereal for breakfast. And even though I woke up late I'm still tired... Started exercising again yesterday
24/03/2020, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! I wish I could say the same
24/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: I started exercising too and my legs are killing me today
24/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: I was on a video call with Norah
24/03/2020, 11:46 - Bee: And I showed her the magnet that Ruth sent and asked her to identify each person
24/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: When she say your face she yelled 'Nischal baiyya' and kept saying 'I want to talk to Nischal baiyya'
Thought of adding you to the call but it was around 2ish so you may have been sleeping
24/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: Saw*
24/03/2020, 11:47 - Bee: I didn't take the nap.
24/03/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Online lecture?
24/03/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: None today
24/03/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Yea I would've been fast asleep then 😂
24/03/2020, 15:10 - Bee: 😂
24/03/2020, 15:10 - Bee: What's up?
24/03/2020, 15:16 - Nischal Abraham: Not a lot. As most days staying at home have been.
24/03/2020, 15:16 - Bee: Same here. Trying to find things to do
24/03/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Somehow I can't focus on studying for longer than an hour when I'm home
24/03/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'd much rather waste time doing anything else
24/03/2020, 15:22 - Bee: I've not even been studying. I should start though. The lockdown here is extended until April 15th
24/03/2020, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: We haven't had an official lockdown yet but we're still isolating
24/03/2020, 15:51 - Bee: Okay
24/03/2020, 15:52 - Bee: A lot of time to study the Bible and pray.
24/03/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: That's true. And reading... Which I haven't done much of either
24/03/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Telling myself this
24/03/2020, 16:03 - Bee: I've hardly done it.
24/03/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Always the case for me where the more free time I have the less I do
24/03/2020, 16:42 - Bee: Are you going to start a book?
24/03/2020, 16:42 - Bee: What are you reading currently?
24/03/2020, 16:42 - Bee: I haven't had a regular quiet time. Mentioning it to you so that I'm accountable
24/03/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: I need to finish books I'd started. The Jim Elliot one is still pending completion
24/03/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Oh
24/03/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Should've specified
A book from the Bible
24/03/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Yea I haven't started any specific book since the last Bible study. That's actually a good idea. Plenty of time to do that noe
24/03/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Now*
24/03/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: What about you?
24/03/2020, 17:55 - Bee: I haven't either. I want to
24/03/2020, 17:58 - Bee: Do you have a lecture tomorrow?
24/03/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Just Mondays so far. Unless something gets announced later on
24/03/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Oh
24/03/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Could we talk tomorrow? Whenever you're free
24/03/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me. I should be free most of the day. I think in the evening there's going to be a prayer thing online with Fairview. But that's later in the evening
24/03/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: So yea... I'll let you know whenever I'm up and done with breakfast :).
24/03/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Okay Nischal :)
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to bed now?
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Bee: No ill be up for a while
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Bee: I am trying to learn ukulele basics
24/03/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Wow! You have a ukulele?
24/03/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Do you remember we visited Usha aunty once? After we visited Philip Uncle and aunty
And she had a ukulele
The next time papa maa and I visited she asked me if I'd like to take it and learn how to play but I said no because me and musical instruments?
But now since I have the time I thought I'll give it a try
I'm okay if I'm terrible at it. Just want to give it a try
24/03/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Everyone starts off not knowing anything. If you enjoy it I'm sure you'll pick it up just fine 😁. Sounds like a fun activity to take up with all this free time
24/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: It is fun. And I was told the uke doesn't hurt because of the nylon strings but my fingers are hurting
24/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: So much of free time
24/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: So bored that I picked up a musical instrument
24/03/2020, 18:43 - Bee: I was shocked that I followed up on the thought
24/03/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Well the hardest part is always the start. And it doesn't hurt as much as playing the guitar. I think after a week your fingers get used to it
24/03/2020, 18:54 - Bee: I hope so
24/03/2020, 18:59 - Bee: I want to cut my hair Nischal
24/03/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Cut it yourself? Cause I doubt any salon would be open now
24/03/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Yes cut it myself
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: What's stopping you?
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Ashley's trimmer doesn't have enough battery. I'm waiting for it to charge
24/03/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: I thought it'd be easier to cut your hair with scissors? Wouldn't the trimmer be harder to control. Also since you have long hair you'd be trimming off the ends right?
24/03/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Trimmer is faster
24/03/2020, 19:37 - Bee: I trimmed more than just the ends
24/03/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Used the scissors. Kinda uneven. I'll correct it after I wash my hair tomorrow
24/03/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: See! It is hard to cut your own hair. And you get to see the ends you're cutting off
24/03/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Trimmer would've been easier
24/03/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Trimmer will work for you Nischal
24/03/2020, 19:47 - Bee: I used it on Jason
24/03/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Easy
24/03/2020, 19:48 - Bee: Nischal
24/03/2020, 19:48 - Bee: That memory you shared
You and your mum walking somewhere and you told her 3 things you'd like in a girl
I'm terribly falling short at one of those :P
24/03/2020, 19:48 - Bee: Like reeaally short
24/03/2020, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: The difference is he didn't have to use it in himself
24/03/2020, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. It was the trivial thoughts of a very young me. I don't care for those things as much anymore
24/03/2020, 20:00 - Bee: 😂 say that after you see my hair
24/03/2020, 20:01 - Bee: I still believe you can do it yourself
24/03/2020, 20:01 - Bee: If the length is not bothering you then I guess it's fine
24/03/2020, 20:06 - Bee: Nischal
24/03/2020, 20:06 - Bee: You okay?
Just checking
24/03/2020, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: I think I'd be okay even if you decided to keep a shorter hairstyle Debby. It's your choice to make. And I'm sure I wouldn't like you any less 😂
24/03/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Cool I'll show it to you tomorrow
24/03/2020, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright. Thanks for asking. Being home all day isn't helping much but I'm getting by each day as it comes
24/03/2020, 20:10 - Bee: Yes I understand. Schedule calls with your friends back home? Or friends there? Or text and catch up maybe?
24/03/2020, 20:11 - Bee: I shouldn't tell you this but here I am. Work on the handstand!
24/03/2020, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well I started exercising yesterday with the intent to work on the handstand. I don't think my upper body could handle a handstand the way it is right now
24/03/2020, 20:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 20:15 - Bee: Same though. My body is aching
24/03/2020, 20:16 - Bee: What's up?
24/03/2020, 20:16 - Bee: It's like I'm talking to you after a long time
24/03/2020, 20:16 - Bee: Which is true I guess
24/03/2020, 20:16 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
24/03/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I'm surprised you're still up at this time. Hopefully I'll have more to say since we're talking after a long time :P
24/03/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: You should be sleeping more to rest up then 😂
25/03/2020, 03:17 - Bee: 😂
25/03/2020, 03:17 - Bee: I am sleeping enough
25/03/2020, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I am done with breakfast but there is an assignment I need to be doing this morning. Would it be fine if we talk later in the evening?
25/03/2020, 11:30 - Bee: Hi :)
25/03/2020, 11:30 - Bee: Yes any time works for me
25/03/2020, 11:30 - Bee: Free whenever you are
25/03/2020, 16:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
25/03/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free in half an hour. Let me know when you can talk after. No time limits after that
25/03/2020, 17:04 - Bee: Isn't there a prayer meeting?
25/03/2020, 17:05 - Bee: I'll be free 11:15ish...
25/03/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: That's at 8pm
25/03/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good. I'll be free then too
25/03/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Nischal
25/03/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Is it okay if we talk tomorrow?
25/03/2020, 17:46 - Bee: I had a tiring day today...
25/03/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: That's perfectly fine Debby! I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier today
25/03/2020, 17:46 - Bee: No it's okay
25/03/2020, 17:46 - Bee: I'm sorry if you moved your schedule around just for the call
25/03/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: No no. I haven't had a schedule for my homestay for a while 😅
25/03/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: I hope your day went well Deb. Will you be heading to bed soon?
25/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Yes. Heading to bed now
25/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Trying to sleep early and wake up early
25/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: By early I mean 11:30ish
25/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: My day went well. Didn't have assignments today because it's supposed to be a 'holiday'. It is gudi padva today
25/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: How's your day going, Nischal?
25/03/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Anything specific you want me to pray for?
25/03/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Nischal?
25/03/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
25/03/2020, 17:52 - Bee: I pray and hope you're eating well and taking care of yourself.
25/03/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: 11:30 sounds early to me
25/03/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: My days been better today than most. Did part of an assignment in the morning. Changed my bedsheets and forced myself to stay downstairs instead of in my room all day
25/03/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: You could pray that I don't find more ways to waste time... There's a lot of Bible studying I wish I could get done but can't push myself to doing it
25/03/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: And those are important things too. Thank you Debby
25/03/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight and sweet dreams! I'll plan my day better tomorrow :)
26/03/2020, 08:06 - Bee: Prayed and I'll continue praying
26/03/2020, 08:06 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)))
26/03/2020, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I hope your day's going as planned
26/03/2020, 10:03 - Bee: Haven't made any plans but I a getting a lot done which I'm happy about
26/03/2020, 10:03 - Bee: Am*
26/03/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's good! I've gotten into the bad habit of getting up at 9:30 which has pushed a meeting I was supposed to have at 10 to 11
26/03/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Meeting with your guide?
26/03/2020, 12:58 - Bee: How's your day going?
26/03/2020, 12:58 - Bee: We had a fun and tiring Zumba session at home. 😂
26/03/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Why you waking up late nana
26/03/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Meeting with group members for group assignments... It's insane how hectic everything has become. Group assignments are terrible sitting at home. Just a load of confusion at every step
26/03/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Oh
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Did you get stuff done though? During the meeting?
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Busy so far. In a sense I haven't had time to waste so that's good 😊
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like fun!
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Bee: How many members in your group?
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Always good!
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Cause I don't feel like putting an alarm in the morning
26/03/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Don't the Sundays streak in anymore
26/03/2020, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Meaning?
26/03/2020, 13:27 - Bee: My bad. I meant sunlight
26/03/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Yea  it does by 9:30. Which is why I can't sleep longer than that
26/03/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Would you be free to talk tonight?
26/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Yes
26/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: What time will you be free?
26/03/2020, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free from now on
26/03/2020, 16:00 - Bee: I'll have dinner now...
26/03/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Is my 11 okay?
26/03/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Your 11 sounds lovely
26/03/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: But anytime you're free just let me know
26/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: Hey
26/03/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy
26/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Free?
26/03/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I am
26/03/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Give me 2 minutes
26/03/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing
26/03/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Hi
26/03/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Hello!
26/03/2020, 17:55 - Bee: I'll call?
26/03/2020, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
26/03/2020, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't get to say it before the bye
26/03/2020, 20:51 - Bee: Goodnight :)
27/03/2020, 07:36 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
27/03/2020, 09:23 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!
27/03/2020, 15:06 - Bee: Nischal
27/03/2020, 15:07 - Bee: Why do we have those 'sharp' cords
I mean #
27/03/2020, 15:07 - Bee: Can't we do without them
27/03/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Well you could. Just fewer songs
27/03/2020, 16:17 - Bee: Oh
27/03/2020, 16:17 - Bee: Okay Nischal
27/03/2020, 16:26 - Bee: I hope you're having a goood day.
27/03/2020, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been alright so far. The assignment feels like it never ends 😕
27/03/2020, 18:46 - Bee: :(
27/03/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Caught up with Reenee and Nidhi in a video call. It was refreshing
27/03/2020, 18:48 - Bee: How did the Bible study go? (If you've finished it by now)
27/03/2020, 18:48 - Bee: On
27/03/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Going to bed.
27/03/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! Bible study is later in the night. I'll probably have dinner before it
27/03/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day went well! Goodnight!!
27/03/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Do two exclamation points mean you're excited
27/03/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Can you say goodnight bee
27/03/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: I don't understand how exclamations are supposed to work 😂
27/03/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: If I use them it feels like I'm too excited. But if I don't then it's like I don't care
27/03/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee :). Hope you get a good night of sleep
27/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Why you thinking so much
27/03/2020, 19:04 - Bee: Thank you. Goodnight, Nischal. ☺
27/03/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: .
27/03/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Oh
27/03/2020, 19:06 - Bee: I asked because I don't think you've used two ever with me
27/03/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Maybe I'm thinking too much
27/03/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Chats are deceptive :o. I prefer voice over messages
27/03/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Then you can send a voice note
27/03/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Only because it makes me feel special
27/03/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Oh and there's another reason why I said this
27/03/2020, 19:10 - Bee: I'll tell you whenever we talk next
27/03/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: You're always special to me Debby
27/03/2020, 19:12 - Bee: It's nice to have physical reminders
27/03/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Well a physical reminder can only be when I finally see you again
27/03/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I get what you mean though. I'll keep 'em coming 😊
27/03/2020, 19:17 - Bee: This will do too
27/03/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Thank you.
27/03/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))
27/03/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight. You're still up for having said goodnight already 😂
27/03/2020, 19:29 - Bee: 😂 last time
Bye!
27/03/2020, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: Last time? Won't you say bye to me tomorrow? 😢
28/03/2020, 12:23 - Bee: I will
28/03/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Bye
28/03/2020, 12:23 - Bee: JK.
28/03/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Hi!!
28/03/2020, 14:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I won't be online much today. Scheduled out my day to finish up as much of my assignments as I possibly can... I'm lagging behind by way too much
28/03/2020, 14:48 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have a good day :). Let me know how it goes
28/03/2020, 14:54 - Bee: Okay. Praying that you finish everything you've planned to do.
28/03/2020, 14:54 - Bee: I'll let you know how my day goes
28/03/2020, 14:54 - Bee: Bye!
28/03/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: I thought of learning this song, but I'll never sound like her so here you go.

https://youtu.be/P892VPKZdeM
28/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Of course you'll never sound like her. She's a her. You're not
28/03/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Also, going out on a limb and asking you, is this for meeeeeeeee?
28/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))
28/03/2020, 19:04 - Bee: Tell me how your day goes. And about all the assignments you've finished
28/03/2020, 19:04 - Bee: Bye!
28/03/2020, 19:04 - Bee: ☺
29/03/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby!
29/03/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Good evening. I hope your day's been good so far
29/03/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Of course. Who else have I shared it to?
29/03/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: I finished 1 assignment. And it took so much mental effort to do it :/
29/03/2020, 15:28 - Bee: My day's been good. I took a looonng nap after a week
29/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺ I was awww-ing for 2 minutes straight
29/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Good job, Nischal. So much better than not finishing. How many more to go?
29/03/2020, 15:29 - Bee: How's your day going?
29/03/2020, 15:30 - Bee: Did y'all have a worship meeting?
29/03/2020, 15:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/03/2020, 15:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/03/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Couldn't take better screenshots
29/03/2020, 15:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/03/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: We had worship this morning. I had to get up earlier than I was and now I'm sleepy enough to take an afternoon nap. In that sense it still feels like a Sunday which is nice ☺️
29/03/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Your video chat sounds like a fun time! Looks like quarantine hasn't stopped you from kid time 😁
29/03/2020, 15:50 - Bee: It was fun!! Prachi didi would keep asking Anjali stuff about lunch or something and Anjali would yell "I'm busy talking on the phone"
For a moment she seemed like a teenager to me
29/03/2020, 15:50 - Bee: Which she will be in 5 years.
29/03/2020, 15:51 - Bee: That's nice. :) Was there a sermon too?
29/03/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Just a short one. Next week they're planning on trying to include the breaking of bread individually at homes
29/03/2020, 17:44 - Bee: Oh. We had it at ours today
29/03/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Btw we are only 4:30 hours away again 😋
29/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
29/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: NO WAYYYY
29/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: 🤩
29/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: 🥳
29/03/2020, 18:42 - Bee: ☎️
29/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: I made egg fried rice for dinner!! Easy recipe. And it tasted good. But everything tastes good when you're hungry. Practiced the ukulele a bit. I find changing chords very difficult. Hopefully it gets better with practice. Also, did you know there's a guitarlele? I don't know how is spelt but that's what Ashish is learning. Along with the piano. Such talented kids. I played with mud when I was a kid 😛
29/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: I hope you're today was/is productive. Let me know how your day goes okay?
29/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Praying for you always.
29/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: You're precious.
29/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
29/03/2020, 19:05 - Bee: ☺
29/03/2020, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: Egg fried rice is always nice 😁. I did know about the guitarlele and so did you actually. But I agree. They're very talented kids!
29/03/2020, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: Aww 🥺
29/03/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying for you too Debby
29/03/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee
30/03/2020, 05:01 - Bee: Good morning! :)
30/03/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I didn't have an all too productive day yesterday. Ended up watching YouTube videos till 1 in the morning and ended up getting late today. Not off to a good start to the week
30/03/2020, 13:17 - Bee: New day today. Try making it different. You know you can
30/03/2020, 13:17 - Bee: I'm trying to make churros
30/03/2020, 14:17 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/03/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: When I saw your message notification popup I thought you got burnt and I got worried! So glad it's just the food though. What are churros supposed to be?
30/03/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Actually I could just Google it... But good on you for finding something other than icing to pipe 😂
30/03/2020, 14:47 - Bee: Hey yes I'm fine.
30/03/2020, 14:47 - Bee: Hahaha I'd rather pipe icing though :P
30/03/2020, 14:48 - Bee: But the churros were good! I think you'll like them if there isn't coated in a lot of sugar like I like it
30/03/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yiu and your sugar... It's gonna come back to bite you some day
30/03/2020, 16:21 - Bee: 😳
30/03/2020, 16:22 - Bee: 🥺
30/03/2020, 16:22 - Bee: 😢
30/03/2020, 16:22 - Bee: 😭
30/03/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How's your day been? Would it be possible to get on a call tonight? I know it's late so it's okay if you can't
30/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Hey
30/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Just saw your message Nischal...
30/03/2020, 19:02 - Bee: It'll be late by the time we cut the call if we get on a call now
30/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: I'm sorry.. I could've checked my phone earlier :(
30/03/2020, 19:03 - Bee: You okay?
30/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. I'm doing fine bee don't worry :)
30/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: It's just been a while since we've talked so I thought I'd ask. We'll try and coordinate for another time :P
30/03/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to bed?
30/03/2020, 19:09 - Bee: We'll talk tomorrow?
30/03/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Whenever you're free
30/03/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Did I tell you about Radhika? She's been coming for the gospel meeting for more than a month
30/03/2020, 19:10 - Bee: I've been in touch with her since meetings got cancelled... And it's encouraging to know that she is still reading the Bible
30/03/2020, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep you did tell me about her. That's awesome she's still reading!! Must be difficult now without gospel meetings happening
30/03/2020, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: And I'm sure I'll find some free time tomorrow to talk
30/03/2020, 19:29 - Bee: Looking forward to talking to you Nischal. Or listening to you talk :P
30/03/2020, 19:30 - Bee: How's your day going?
30/03/2020, 19:30 - Bee: Yes. I want to make breakfast for papa tomorrow
30/03/2020, 19:30 - Bee: In a few minutes
30/03/2020, 19:35 - Bee: What did you do today?
30/03/2020, 19:35 - Bee: What did you eat for breakfast + lunch? What are your gonna have for dinner?
30/03/2020, 19:35 - Bee: What did you read in your quiet time today?
30/03/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Tell me one unique thing about today
30/03/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Its still bright outside
30/03/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't have one :(
30/03/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Eggs and bread. Dinner will probably be oats since I didn't have it for breakfast
30/03/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Absolutely nothing productive
30/03/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: I have a feeling this time it'll be the other way around :P
30/03/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Uneventful. And I don't feel like I want it to be any more than that
30/03/2020, 19:42 - Bee: It's not bright at this time otherwise?
30/03/2020, 19:42 - Bee: You can still have it. The day isn't over yet. Go!!
30/03/2020, 19:43 - Bee: For breakfast and lunch? I hope you're not losing weight Nischal
30/03/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Oh. Is there stuff you should be doing? 
(Not pushing it further)
30/03/2020, 19:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/03/2020, 19:44 - Bee: I've been watching a lot of baby videos
30/03/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
30/03/2020, 19:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/03/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Bye :)))))) (a realistic smiley considering all the double chins I'm gonna have by the end of this)
30/03/2020, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: You won't be having double chins Debby... The handstand challenge still stands
30/03/2020, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: It might be cause of the time shift... But it's 08:10 and it's still bright out
31/03/2020, 06:23 - Bee: Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm
31/03/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Hi Nischal
31/03/2020, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby. What's up?
31/03/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Hey :)
31/03/2020, 16:08 - Bee: The prayer meeting just got over
31/03/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea today's Tuesday. How was it?
31/03/2020, 17:00 - Bee: It went well. There were quite a few people
31/03/2020, 17:00 - Bee: And we were divided into groups automatically for prayer. Nice!
31/03/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! What's for dinner?
31/03/2020, 17:42 - Bee: There was Dal and rice and a vegetable but I wasn't hungry so I didn't eat.
31/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: But I'm hungry now
31/03/2020, 17:43 - Bee: What's up?
31/03/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: My hair feels like an annoyance. How do you manage long hair 😶
31/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Cut it off!!!!!!!!
31/03/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: I was thinking I should probably exercise some today. My bodies going to atrophy at the rate that I'm going
31/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: It'll be okay I promise
31/03/2020, 17:47 - Bee: If you're planning on doing it, I wanna see!!
31/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: I don't.
31/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Free to talk later tonight?
31/03/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Brave of you to think there's something to atrophy
31/03/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: I am
31/03/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
31/03/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Muscles always exist. My body couldn't move without them
31/03/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: What time would you be free?
31/03/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Sure Nischal
31/03/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Whatever you say
31/03/2020, 18:02 - Bee: In an hour?
31/03/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I can sleep in tomorrow
31/03/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Whatever works for you. You don't have to stay up just to talk though! We could talk another time in the day. It doesn't have to be you giving up sleep :(
31/03/2020, 18:23 - Bee: During the day never works out :(
31/03/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Let me know when you're free then
31/03/2020, 18:50 - Bee: In 15?
31/03/2020, 18:50 - Bee: Unless you want to talk tomorrow during the day...
31/03/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free to talk. It's only 7 here
31/03/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Okay
31/03/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
31/03/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Hey
31/03/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Give me 5 minutes
31/03/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: Cool
31/03/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Hey
31/03/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy
31/03/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Free?
31/03/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Count to 30
31/03/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Okay
31/03/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Done
01/04/2020, 04:08 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. ☺
01/04/2020, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning! Hope you got up in time for your assignment
01/04/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Hey :))
01/04/2020, 12:52 - Bee: I did
01/04/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Watching Courageous with papa
01/04/2020, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Nice... I like that movie
01/04/2020, 13:58 - Bee: I do too
01/04/2020, 13:59 - Bee: It was my second time watching it. Still got emotional like the first time. Papa was crying during a few parts too
01/04/2020, 13:59 - Bee: It was cute
01/04/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Yea it is an emotional movie. I've only seen it once before
01/04/2020, 15:38 - Bee: Today I learnt that if I'm watching I movie with my parents then I should watch it once before so that I know the plot. Because they keep asking questions
01/04/2020, 15:52 - Bee: My grandmother is of the mindset that boys can do no wrong. And even if they make a mistake. It's okay. They're boys. They never change right?
😡
01/04/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Well you can't change your grandma's mind but you don't need to adopt it
01/04/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... That sounds like a solution I should've come up with when I used to watch movies with Nidhi as a kid
01/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: I agree
01/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Would've saved some energy
01/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: What's up, Nischal?
01/04/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Just did some light exercises today. Working towards the handstand! 😤
01/04/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: What's up at your end? How was dinner?
01/04/2020, 18:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/04/2020, 18:44 - Bee: I skipped dinner. Had an evening snack and wasn't hungry enough for dinner
01/04/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: What was your evening snack then? 😂
01/04/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'm thinking of shifting my dinner time to earlier
01/04/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Boiled corn with butter and masala
01/04/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Good idea. Early dinner today then?
01/04/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea cause there's a prayer meeting at 8 so I was hoping to finish dinner before then
01/04/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Oh
01/04/2020, 19:17 - Bee: There's still some time right?
01/04/2020, 19:17 - Bee: I shall to sleep now
01/04/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Let me know how your day goes. :))
01/04/2020, 19:18 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
01/04/2020, 19:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/04/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Bye!
01/04/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Aww ☺. You are the gem Debby
01/04/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: There's still some time. But I'm behind schedule so I'll probably just eat after in peace rather than rush now
02/04/2020, 10:21 - Bee: You're right I am
02/04/2020, 10:21 - Bee: :P
02/04/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I had another late night and late morning situation 😕
02/04/2020, 11:28 - Bee: How was your day yesterday?
02/04/2020, 11:28 - Bee: YouTube?
02/04/2020, 11:28 - Bee: New day today, Nischal
02/04/2020, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. It is a new day
02/04/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yesterday was a good day for the most of it. Just can't seem to sleep on time
02/04/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day planned for today?
02/04/2020, 14:01 - Bee: I have an assignment which I have to submit by 7. And I don't feel like finishing it. I'm done for today
02/04/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Now for the rest of today
I'm going to take a long shower. Sit down for the Bible study. Watch a movie with the family + dinner. Pick up the ukulele and make noise. Watch a little of This is us (Nidhi (and also you) told me about it. It's so emotional. I've cried at least once during every episode. And it's not the water eyes kinda cry. There's snot and all). And then I'll go to sleep
02/04/2020, 14:04 - Bee: How's your day planned?
02/04/2020, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like a fun day! I'm watching a movie called "The Internship" which was recommended to me a few months back but I never got around to watching it before
02/04/2020, 16:28 - Bee: It's not the same as. The intern right?
02/04/2020, 16:40 - Bee: Something's that weighing in on my heart and I'm asking you to pray with me
The kids in Dharamveer Nagar SS come from homes where there's a lot of domestic violence. One 3 year old would come with a dressed wound on his feet
And now that they're home the whole day, I'm praying the beating doesn't get worse. Praying that miraculously there's no beating at all
02/04/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Na its a different movie
02/04/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: I remember you telling me about it before. I'll definitely be praying along Debby
02/04/2020, 17:42 - Bee: :)
02/04/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Enjoying your movie?
02/04/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Did you watch the next LOTR?
02/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: What's up?
02/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: Early dinner today?
02/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: What was for lunch?
02/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: How are you really?
02/04/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: The movie was nice. Did not expect one scene in it considering the tone of the movie but overall it's a nice motivating movie. I finished all 3 LOTR movies a while back. I don't think I want to watch the Hobbit series.

Just finished exercising. I felt so tired and weak today did not want to exercise but put in half an hour anyway. I think constant exercise over quantity in one day is a lot better.

Dinner will probably be stir fried vegetables in a tortilla wrap. Lunch was leftover fried rice
02/04/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: I am demotivated. I know there's a lot to be done, and a lot I can do. And in my head it all makes sense and I'm screaming to myself telling me I have no time to waste. But reality is I barely want to move downstairs to grab a glass of water
02/04/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: That being said... I did exercise today. I'm considering that a win
02/04/2020, 18:13 - Bee: ?
02/04/2020, 18:13 - Bee: No not this one
02/04/2020, 18:13 - Bee: ?
02/04/2020, 18:13 - Bee: ?
02/04/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Not early... I don't really know... It'll be when I feel hungry I guess
02/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: I'm guilty of this too... Praying that God motivates you and you motivate yourself
02/04/2020, 18:18 - Bee: If you want to talk anytime any day tell me okay?
02/04/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. The same stands for you. Though I can't promise I'll always be able to get on a call immediately but you can ask whenever 😁
02/04/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Y u copying me
02/04/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I will.
02/04/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Okay fine. You can't talk to me anytime okay?
02/04/2020, 18:26 - Bee: But why? 🥺
02/04/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Then I'm not copying you
02/04/2020, 18:28 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
02/04/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: You can't have it both ways
02/04/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Fine.
02/04/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Nanaaaaa
02/04/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Goodnight 🤗
02/04/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
03/04/2020, 08:22 - Bee: They say Disneyland is that happiest place on Earth. Apparently, no one has ever been standing next to you.
03/04/2020, 08:23 - Bee: 😉
03/04/2020, 09:15 - Bee: The*
03/04/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: Debby. I think you're supposed to use pick up lines before you're in a relationship
03/04/2020, 10:03 - Bee: Not me. I'll always pursue you. Because you have 11 protons. (You're sodium fine, man)
03/04/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... I don't think I understood that one 😂
03/04/2020, 11:09 - Bee: 'So-damn' fine. 11 protons because atomic number is 11?
03/04/2020, 11:09 - Bee: What ya
03/04/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! I still don't get the protons part but at this point it's probably best to give up on explaining it 🤣🤣
03/04/2020, 11:48 - Bee: NISCHAL FORGET THAT I SAID ANYTHING
03/04/2020, 11:48 - Bee: 😂
03/04/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: I probably will in a day or two. My memories not all too great
03/04/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby. Any chance of getting on a call today?
03/04/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Hey. Yes!!!
03/04/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Tonight?
03/04/2020, 14:04 - Bee: What time?
03/04/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Anytime you're comfortable with. My Bible study is only at 8pm my time
03/04/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: So yea, preferably before then
03/04/2020, 14:08 - Bee: 11 my time?
03/04/2020, 14:09 - Bee: No wait
03/04/2020, 14:09 - Bee: 10:30?
03/04/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: Anytime from now till before your 12:30
03/04/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: Works for me
03/04/2020, 14:09 - Bee: Okay
03/04/2020, 14:09 - Bee: We're having a family zoom thing in a while
03/04/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Have fun with that
03/04/2020, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: Extended family?
03/04/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Yes
03/04/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Mother's side
03/04/2020, 14:20 - Bee: Mother's side of the family (the adults) fast and pray on Fridays... So they thought if have a prayer thing on zoom
03/04/2020, 14:57 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a fantastic idea
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Yeah
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Bee: I'm going to let my hair grow Nischal
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Bee: More more cutting
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Just the regular trim but nothing more
03/04/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like it'd make it way shorter
03/04/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Haww
03/04/2020, 17:01 - Bee: No
03/04/2020, 17:01 - Bee: NO MORE CUTTING
03/04/2020, 17:01 - Bee: As long as it can get without being dry and unhealthy
03/04/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like an accurate description of my hair at the moment 😂
03/04/2020, 17:02 - Bee: You're letting your hair grow as long as it can get?!
03/04/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Hahaha
03/04/2020, 17:02 - Bee: I'd like to see that
03/04/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: I am. We'll see how it goes. As long as I'm home and don't need to meet people I don't need to worry about how it looks
03/04/2020, 17:04 - Bee: And when the sides reach your ears?
03/04/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: It already has. But it's just curling up so isn't too annoying right now
03/04/2020, 17:07 - Bee: Do you mind sending a photo
03/04/2020, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'll try... Done with dinner?
03/04/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Nope. I'll eat now
03/04/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Ah I forget your dinner time is later than mine 😋
03/04/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Are you saying that because your lunch is referred to as dinner or because my dinners are usually late?
03/04/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: It's cause your dinners are usually late. But to be fair my dinners have been pretty late these days as well
03/04/2020, 17:27 - Bee: What happened to having early dinners nana
03/04/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: It's a work in progress okay....
03/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: You're right
03/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: It is
03/04/2020, 17:55 - Bee: 10:32?
03/04/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Nischal

04/04/2020, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: How's yours going?
04/04/2020, 12:11 - Bee: My day is going well. I didn't have too many assignments today
04/04/2020, 12:11 - Bee: I had a fulfilling quiet time which I'm so happy about
04/04/2020, 12:33 - Bee: How can someone sing like that 😌
04/04/2020, 12:33 - Bee: The song gave me all the feels
04/04/2020, 12:37 - Bee: What was the story behind this one?
04/04/2020, 12:41 - Bee: Awwww he's so funny
04/04/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yea my reaction was the same!
04/04/2020, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: That's the SoundCloud one. So the girl who drew it worked with nice Peter before
04/04/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Oh
04/04/2020, 13:08 - Bee: She draws amazing
04/04/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yep she does. If you like drawing videos you should check out her other ones as well. They're really cute drawings and many of them are over music
04/04/2020, 15:19 - Bee: Cool
04/04/2020, 15:19 - Bee: I'll check them out
04/04/2020, 16:06 - Bee: Do you want to play ludo
04/04/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I finally started reading a book
04/04/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Which one?
04/04/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: How?
04/04/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Ludo King 
The app
04/04/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Reenee rolf and I have been praying
04/04/2020, 17:18 - Bee: From Prussia, with love 
It is the George Muller story I had told you about
04/04/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Praying together is nice 😂
04/04/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Hahahaha
04/04/2020, 17:55 - Bee: It is!!
04/04/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: I seem to have forgotten
04/04/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Btw what're you up to?
04/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Playing ludo with Reenee Rolf and Daniel
04/04/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: How are you chatting and playing at the same time?
04/04/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Replying from the notifications
04/04/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that works
04/04/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: But you wouldn't be able to keep up
04/04/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: If I sent multiple messages then
04/04/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Or would you... Maybe my phone's just old
04/04/2020, 18:29 - Bee: I can nana
04/04/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well enjoy your game. I'll get in my exercise for the day
04/04/2020, 18:51 - Bee: I WON!!! They're still playing
04/04/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: I usually only play for first winner instead of last loser. It takes so long to finish otherwise
04/04/2020, 19:36 - Bee: I wanted to watch Rolf lose
04/04/2020, 19:36 - Bee: But Daniel lost
04/04/2020, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Congratulations on winning then!
04/04/2020, 20:25 - Bee: Thank you 🤩
04/04/2020, 20:25 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)))
04/04/2020, 20:25 - Bee: How's your day going?
04/04/2020, 20:58 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! My day's been alright. Bought chicken for dinner
05/04/2020, 07:12 - Bee: Chicken curry and rice? Chicken sandwiches?
05/04/2020, 07:12 - Bee: Chicken fried rice?
05/04/2020, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: Boiled chicken and vegetables. I had it with bread... Nothing fancy but it's filling and tasty so I'll take it
05/04/2020, 09:21 - Bee: Ahh
05/04/2020, 09:21 - Bee: O had chicken curry and neer dosa
05/04/2020, 09:21 - Bee: I*
05/04/2020, 09:34 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds fancy and tasty 😋. How was worship?
05/04/2020, 09:38 - Bee: Yes it was goood. I'm so full now. I'll take a nap
05/04/2020, 09:38 - Bee: Worship was amazing.:') 
Never have I been more grateful for technology
05/04/2020, 09:38 - Bee: At the end everyone unmuted themselves to chat
05/04/2020, 09:38 - Bee: And Makayla yelled 'Hi Debby'
05/04/2020, 09:39 - Bee: I melted
05/04/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Do you have a worship meeting today?
05/04/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Sahil joined too
05/04/2020, 09:42 - Nischal Abraham: I do have worship today. I'll message once it's done. Glad to hear you had a good one 😊
05/04/2020, 09:43 - Bee: Okay. :)
05/04/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Worship was good. Lunch is done. I'm thinking of taking a nap this afternoon
05/04/2020, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: Not used to getting up at 6:30 in the morning 😅
05/04/2020, 17:24 - Bee: Hi!!
05/04/2020, 17:24 - Bee: Did you take a nap?
05/04/2020, 17:24 - Bee: 6:30 wow!!
05/04/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I did
05/04/2020, 17:47 - Bee: 😃
05/04/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hey it's a big deal for me 😂
05/04/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been?
05/04/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Yes yes I'm not being sarcastic nana
05/04/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Day's going well. I went for a run in the park here. I'm so tired. Feels good
05/04/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. You're allowed to go for a run?
05/04/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Inside the society
05/04/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. Well any exercise is nice. Still no Zumba then?
05/04/2020, 18:25 - Bee: No Zumba. I now prefer stepping out of the house anyway
05/04/2020, 18:34 - Bee: What's up?
05/04/2020, 18:34 - Bee: How did worship go?
05/04/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Was there a message?
05/04/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Worship was good! There was a message after but not for very long. We had the table partaking at our individual homes today
05/04/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Did you have bread?
05/04/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Just normal bread slice
05/04/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Okay
05/04/2020, 18:47 - Bee: We had the same
05/04/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: I guess that's the case for most people trying to do it at home
05/04/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Yes it is
05/04/2020, 19:03 - Bee: What's the bravest thing you have ever done?
05/04/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Would it be valid if I'm the only one who considers it brave?
05/04/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Now that I think about whatever I say would just sound like I'm boasting about it
05/04/2020, 19:12 - Bee: I won't think you're boasting
05/04/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Yes it does!
05/04/2020, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Then at the moment what comes to mind is coming to Ireland
05/04/2020, 19:51 - Bee: That was brave
05/04/2020, 19:51 - Bee: And from all the updates you've been giving.. I think it's very brave that your putting yourself out there... meeting so many amazing people which wouldn't have happened had you been shy/kept to yourself
05/04/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby. You're too kind ☺️
05/04/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: What's the bravest thing you've ever done?
05/04/2020, 20:46 - Bee: Brb
05/04/2020, 21:26 - Bee: HEY.
05/04/2020, 21:26 - Bee: Ludo. 🤷🏻‍♀
05/04/2020, 21:26 - Bee: You're brave!
05/04/2020, 21:26 - Bee: I don't have just one answer... I'm not saying I'm very brave or anything but I don't know how to select just one
05/04/2020, 21:28 - Bee: Spending a year in Kerala. I almost came back after two days. 
Saying yes to Sunday school (I was terrified of the responsibility at the time. Still am)
Sharing with 2 people what happened with me when I was 12 
These are the only ones I could think of now
05/04/2020, 21:45 - Bee: What trait do you wish you didn't have?
05/04/2020, 21:46 - Bee: Nischal are you sleeping
05/04/2020, 21:51 - Bee: Can't keep my eyes open anymore :(
05/04/2020, 21:51 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal
05/04/2020, 22:00 - Bee: Nischal you're special and very very dear to me. Bye
06/04/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: You slept very late! 😮
06/04/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Well in a sense so did I. Sorry I didn't reply yesterday I went to have dinner and then didn't check my phone at all
06/04/2020, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: Those are all brave things too
06/04/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Lethargy, laziness, the feeling where I'd rather do anything but productive work
06/04/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: 🥺
06/04/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon though. I hope you're having and continue to have a wonderful day
06/04/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: I fell into my pitfall of keeping an alarm which is accidentally ending it and falling back asleep for 3 more hours
06/04/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: So I just got up. I'm sure you're having a better day than I am so far 😅
06/04/2020, 13:24 - Bee: Hey!
06/04/2020, 13:25 - Bee: But your last seen was 4 something AM
06/04/2020, 13:25 - Bee: I am. We made jalebi today. 😋
06/04/2020, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: My 4 something AM?
06/04/2020, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! You can make those at home!?
06/04/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Yes!!
06/04/2020, 16:34 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/04/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Papa made the shapes
06/04/2020, 16:34 - Bee: He's so good at it. Mine didn't look like jalebi
06/04/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Hey
06/04/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: I don't really like jalebi but those look like them
06/04/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for the late reply. My internet went down for some reason and I just managed to get the router working again
06/04/2020, 19:10 - Bee: They were yum. But too sweet for you
06/04/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely any form of jalebi is too sweet for me 😂
06/04/2020, 19:11 - Bee: It's okay, Nischal
06/04/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Is it though. How am I to stop you from eating too many sweets if I just give you all of them?
06/04/2020, 19:26 - Bee: YES IT IS
06/04/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Every sweet is too sweet for you!
06/04/2020, 19:26 - Bee: And don't worry, in case you forget I'll remind you
06/04/2020, 19:26 - Bee: 😋
06/04/2020, 19:36 - Bee: What's up nana?
06/04/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished with dinner. What about you?
06/04/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: I finally managed to have a (sort of) early dinner. But the way it looks outside you'd say it's only 5 or 6 in the evening
06/04/2020, 19:46 - Bee: Going to bed now
06/04/2020, 19:46 - Bee: YAY!! Well done, Nischal
06/04/2020, 19:46 - Bee: What was for dinner?
06/04/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Scrambled eggs and bread
06/04/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: You're up pretty late these days. All good?
06/04/2020, 19:48 - Bee: All good yes. Playing ludo with Daniel, Reenee, and Rolf
06/04/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Haha that's nice. Is that a regular thing now?
06/04/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Yes. Every night (unsaid rule)
06/04/2020, 19:52 - Bee: I'm too competitive Nischal
06/04/2020, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: So did you win tonight?
06/04/2020, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I just remembered you're going to sleep. We can talk tomorrow Debby. I'm glad you're having fun days 😊
06/04/2020, 19:57 - Bee: Won one lost one
06/04/2020, 19:57 - Bee: We're playing another game
06/04/2020, 19:57 - Bee: I'm up Nischal
06/04/2020, 19:58 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Don't you have to get up early in the morning?
06/04/2020, 20:08 - Bee: I do. I'll wake up early and take an afternoon nap
06/04/2020, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Ah afternoon naps are nice. But it ruins your night sleep. But I guess if you're planning on staying up it works out
06/04/2020, 20:23 - Bee: I didn't plan on staying up... It's just that we can't stop on one game
06/04/2020, 20:23 - Bee: How's your day going?
06/04/2020, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: Feels like I'm missing out on ludo. Well today's been like every other day. Uneventful so far... Didn't feel like exercising either 😒
06/04/2020, 20:26 - Bee: Do you want to play one game?
06/04/2020, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: No no that's fine. Fomo is a state of mind 😂. And I'm not too keen on ludo. It's too luck based
06/04/2020, 20:43 - Bee: But ludo is fun!
06/04/2020, 20:43 - Bee: That's something I heard for the first time
06/04/2020, 20:48 - Nischal Abraham: The ludo part or the fomo part?
06/04/2020, 20:49 - Bee: The ludo part
06/04/2020, 20:49 - Bee: Actually both.
06/04/2020, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: Okay I'm just saying that to look cool. I enjoy playing ludo especially when it's with people I know. But the best part about those games is to see the reactions
06/04/2020, 20:51 - Bee: 😂
06/04/2020, 20:51 - Bee: Your idea of cool is not playing ludo?
06/04/2020, 20:52 - Bee: It is. We can chat during the game you know. And send emojis/reactions
Nothing like playing in person though
06/04/2020, 20:56 - Bee: Nischal
Anything you would like me to do differently when it comes to this relationship?
06/04/2020, 20:58 - Nischal Abraham: My idea of cool is acting like I don't care
06/04/2020, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's cool. I thought it'd be like you're just playing the game with the computer
06/04/2020, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. There's things I wish I did differently. 
Is there anything would like me to do differently?
06/04/2020, 21:03 - Bee: What things are you talking about?
06/04/2020, 21:03 - Bee: No. Just the ones I mentioned before
06/04/2020, 21:04 - Bee: Also, I'd like if we could pray together. Doesn't have to be often or anything specific
06/04/2020, 21:04 - Bee: Just something the came to my mind
06/04/2020, 21:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'd like that too 😊
06/04/2020, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: Just the times I pray about us. There's so many uncertainties that I wish I knew about. But a part of me knows that I just need to trust God more through them
06/04/2020, 21:12 - Bee: Oh. I try to remind myself that God will reveal everything in His time
06/04/2020, 21:12 - Bee: Nischal... Hard for me to believe that there's nothing
06/04/2020, 21:12 - Bee: You can tell me
06/04/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I know... But sometimes it's hard to keep it in mind
06/04/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: When something comes to mind I'll let you know. I honestly can't think of anything right now. 
You remember the time I asked if it would be better if I was honest with you even if it was difficult?
06/04/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Yes
06/04/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Got it.
06/04/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: I'm holding you to that. So if there's something that comes to mind I'll be letting you know. And then we can work it out together 😊
06/04/2020, 21:21 - Bee: Okay Nischal.
06/04/2020, 21:21 - Bee: I'm holding you to it
06/04/2020, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: Okay!
06/04/2020, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: Game of ludo still going on?
06/04/2020, 21:24 - Bee: No we finished an hour ago
06/04/2020, 21:25 - Bee: It feels like this is the only time in the day when we get to talk
06/04/2020, 21:25 - Bee: I'll go to sleep now
06/04/2020, 21:25 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
06/04/2020, 21:27 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! If you ever want to talk just let me know... It doesn't have to be this late
06/04/2020, 21:35 - Bee: I'll keep that in mind
06/04/2020, 21:37 - Nischal Abraham: You're still up?
06/04/2020, 21:39 - Bee: Yes
06/04/2020, 21:39 - Bee: I miss you. So much
06/04/2020, 21:39 - Bee: I'll go to sleep now
06/04/2020, 21:39 - Bee: Bye
06/04/2020, 21:40 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too!! Sleep well :)
06/04/2020, 21:52 - Bee: I've been feeling unloved these past few days. I don't know why. I thought those insecurities weren't there anymore but I was wrong. I don't like feeling this way. 
Please pray for me
07/04/2020, 08:07 - Nischal Abraham: I will Debby
07/04/2020, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: Hey... How did your assignments go?
07/04/2020, 12:06 - Bee: All done for today
07/04/2020, 12:06 - Bee: What's up?
07/04/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Managed to get up early!
07/04/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: And by early I mean 7:30 😂
07/04/2020, 12:12 - Bee: 7:30 is super early! I woke up waay late then
07/04/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: When did you get up?
07/04/2020, 12:24 - Bee: I woke up at 9:45ish today
07/04/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: That's my usual time of getting up 😮. Don't you have submissions at 10?
07/04/2020, 12:29 - Bee: I had one at 10:30... Got to it right away. Submitted it 20 minutes late... The teacher hasn't said anything yet
07/04/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. So what's plans for the day?
07/04/2020, 12:34 - Bee: Just the usual. I'll go for a walk at 6. Then there's the prayer meeting. Dinner and then ludo
07/04/2020, 12:34 - Bee: What's your day like today?
07/04/2020, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: Lunch in some time. Then hopefully I don't fall asleep. Will be calling my parents after your prayer meeting
07/04/2020, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: And I'll give another go at the Sally up challenge
07/04/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Looked up the song. It's so catchy. But doing push ups throughout the song sounds like a nightmare
07/04/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm at 1:05 😂
07/04/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: Daniel managed to reach 1:44 last we spoke. And Paddy was at 1:30s
07/04/2020, 13:07 - Bee: And Daniel is the father among y'all!!
07/04/2020, 13:07 - Bee: It is completely unrelated but still
07/04/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Whats the duration you're aiming for today?
07/04/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Better than before. I try to hold on as long as I can. Thinking of starting to make a note of it so I can track progress
07/04/2020, 13:14 - Bee: Good idea. Next step is to record it all and make a progress video to upload on YouTube!!
07/04/2020, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. I'm not too big on recording videos of myself
07/04/2020, 13:43 - Bee: Then how are you going to become an influencer Nischal
07/04/2020, 13:44 - Bee: Now that I typed it out and read it again I know it sounds stupid
07/04/2020, 13:44 - Bee: 😛
07/04/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: I will enjoy my not so famous life just fine. Maybe you could end up big on social media. I barely know how it works anyway
07/04/2020, 14:10 - Bee: You can't have a not so famous life if I end up big. I guess I'll have to give up on my childhood dream
07/04/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Your childhood dream was to be famous? And I can still have a not so famous life
07/04/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: There are plenty of famous people who have non famous relations
07/04/2020, 16:14 - Bee: It wasn't. My childhood dream was to be a doctor and a mother
07/04/2020, 16:14 - Bee: Said this for the effect
07/04/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Ah now I understand what you meant
07/04/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Is it ludo time now?
07/04/2020, 17:03 - Bee: No
07/04/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Having dinner
07/04/2020, 17:04 - Bee: My chapatis are getting better!! 😎
07/04/2020, 17:04 - Bee: Ludo around 11 I think
07/04/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's pretty late
07/04/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! I have made zero progress on chapattis myself
07/04/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Did you make progress on the Sally challenge?
07/04/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh haven't done it yet... I'll need to warm up as well before I do
07/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Oh
07/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: I didn't go for the walk. I was feeling lazy
07/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Did some exercise at home though
07/04/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm feeling lazy for the Sally up too
07/04/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Do it nana
07/04/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I will.  What was for dinner?
07/04/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Mixed vegetable and chapati
07/04/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Did you make the vegetables as well?
07/04/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Still 1:05 it seems. I'm gonna have to make this a regular thing
07/04/2020, 18:15 - Bee: No no. It had so many vegetables. I wouldn't ruined it
07/04/2020, 18:15 - Bee: At least you're not regressing nama
07/04/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Nana*
07/04/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: At least
07/04/2020, 18:33 - Bee: What are you doing?
07/04/2020, 18:33 - Bee: How are you?
07/04/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Internet surfing... I'm alright. Feeling a bit cooped up sitting at home but somehow I still would rather do this than go somewhere... It's a weird feeling
07/04/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: What are you doing?
07/04/2020, 18:37 - Bee: I'm playing ludo with RDR
07/04/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: You've got initials now!! 😱
07/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Noooo it's easier to type instead of the names
07/04/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: You're a whole gang now... Nice nice
07/04/2020, 19:17 - Bee: What gang?!
07/04/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Do you have assignments to finish?
07/04/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: I do indeed... I don't think I'll ever reach a point in this semester when I don't
07/04/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Oh
07/04/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Working on any today?
07/04/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: I did one in the morning. I should do more tonight as well
07/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Oh
07/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: So no sleeping early then?
07/04/2020, 19:50 - Bee: I should sleep early... Didn't get to nap today. Had too many assignments
07/04/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
07/04/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Nischal
07/04/2020, 19:53 - Bee: Nischal
07/04/2020, 19:53 - Bee: Nischal
07/04/2020, 19:54 - Bee: Nischal
07/04/2020, 19:55 - Bee: Nischal
07/04/2020, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
07/04/2020, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I'm on a call with Megha and school friends. It's Megha's birthday today
08/04/2020, 06:28 - Bee: Oh!! Sorry 🙈
08/04/2020, 07:26 - Bee: I slept for 9 hours today 😱
08/04/2020, 07:26 - Bee: And I'm still sleepy. 🤷🏻‍♀
08/04/2020, 07:59 - Bee: Hi Nischal!!
08/04/2020, 07:59 - Bee: I made banana pancakes for breakfast today 😋 easy, yummy, and filling. And healthy if you use atta instead of maida.
08/04/2020, 08:05 - Bee: The weather is weird today. It looks like it's going to rain. Very gloomy
08/04/2020, 09:32 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like normal Irish weather 😁. But it's been very sunny these past few days here
08/04/2020, 09:32 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds yummy!
08/04/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: That's a nice amount of sleep I'd say! I slept for 7 and that's cause I was snoozing my alarm for an hour
08/04/2020, 09:43 - Bee: Sunny sounds good
08/04/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: And here I thought you liked the rains more
08/04/2020, 09:49 - Bee: I do. You dont
08/04/2020, 10:07 - Nischal Abraham: It's not that I don't like the rains... It's just in certain scenarios where I need to be outdoors and travelling I find it a bit inconvenient
08/04/2020, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Did you see the moon yesterday? It was a full moon and looked really pretty from my window
08/04/2020, 10:09 - Bee: I did!!! It looked a little pink from here
08/04/2020, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: It didn't look as pink as people told me it would from here
08/04/2020, 10:14 - Bee: Oh. It had a light orange-yellow tinge here
08/04/2020, 10:15 - Bee: I watched Onward today
08/04/2020, 10:15 - Bee: It's a nice movie
08/04/2020, 10:15 - Bee: I cried a little
08/04/2020, 12:34 - Nischal Abraham: Is that the new Disney movie?
08/04/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Yes
08/04/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Disney pixar
08/04/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Hey!
08/04/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
08/04/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up falling asleep. It was nice and warm in the room
08/04/2020, 18:13 - Bee: When you were here I remember you telling me you'd never take naps
08/04/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Join the nap club!
08/04/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: I rarely take naps here as well. But this lockdown can make me do strange things
08/04/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Yes it's quite weird
08/04/2020, 18:22 - Bee: The lockdown here may get extended for another two weeks
08/04/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Not surprised. Are you?
08/04/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I am not. I was praying for it to get extended
08/04/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: You want a longer lockdown!? Are you just trying to avoid going to college...
08/04/2020, 18:29 - Bee: No... I will go the day college starts (assuming my mother allows me)
It'll get worse if the lockdown is lifted. With public transport and our intelligent citizens who make everything a celebration
08/04/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Well that initial reaction is going to happen whenever the lockdown is lifted. Whether it be now or later... Also I guess lockdown would only be lifted when the situation is better right?
08/04/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Yes... Which isn't now
08/04/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I'm going to try making donuts
08/04/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Changing chords is difficult for me
08/04/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Just keep practicing you'll be fine 😁
08/04/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: That's cool! I don't even know what goes into a donut
08/04/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Is that just another excuse to use your icing? 😂
08/04/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Donuts are the easiest. Going by the recipe... Never made them before
08/04/2020, 19:07 - Bee: I wish!! I don't have stuff for the cupcake wala icing. I can try glazed though
08/04/2020, 19:07 - Bee: I don't have enough flour. Of there's a way to get that, I'll make them tomorrow
08/04/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds interesting. I thought donuts would involve some baking
08/04/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Won't that need an oven?
08/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Nope. Donuts are deep fried
08/04/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Interesting. As you can see I know absolutely nothing about them.
08/04/2020, 19:46 - Bee: I thought they were bake too until I looked up the recipe in Saturday
08/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Baked*
08/04/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'm no expert but isn't deep frying unhealthy?
08/04/2020, 19:49 - Bee: It is
08/04/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Just checking ,😋
08/04/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Heeeyyyy don't you eat donuts?
08/04/2020, 19:50 - Bee: I've had two donuts in my entire life.
08/04/2020, 19:50 - Bee: No wait. 3 donuts. 3!!!!
08/04/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: I've eaten way more than 3 donuts in my life
08/04/2020, 19:52 - Bee: I always thought they were too pricey for so little
08/04/2020, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: They probably are. I don't think I've ever had them alone through. It was always with a group so more of a social thing I guess
08/04/2020, 20:01 - Bee: Oh
08/04/2020, 20:01 - Bee: How's your day been?
08/04/2020, 20:01 - Nischal Abraham: It's been alright. Afternoon sleep is weird. Making dinner now
08/04/2020, 20:02 - Bee: What's for dinner?
08/04/2020, 20:04 - Bee: Going to bed. I hope you have a good rest of today Nischal. Bye. :)
08/04/2020, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: Egg something. I'll let you know once it's done 😅
08/04/2020, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a goodnight's sleep 😊
09/04/2020, 11:13 - Bee: Starting with the donuts. Making the dough now. If it doesn't work out I'm going to be disappointed
09/04/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be disappointed Debby. I'm sure it'll work out 😁
09/04/2020, 11:19 - Bee: Okay
09/04/2020, 11:19 - Bee: I'll keep you updated
09/04/2020, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: At least Ashley will eat it regardless
09/04/2020, 12:37 - Bee: 😂 true.
09/04/2020, 12:37 - Bee: That's my hope
09/04/2020, 12:37 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/04/2020, 12:39 - Bee: I'm tempted to peek every 2 minutes ya
09/04/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Don't you have to let it rest? Won't peeking ruin it?
09/04/2020, 13:24 - Bee: Yes. I'm not peeking
09/04/2020, 13:39 - Bee: The dough has risen!!!!!!
09/04/2020, 13:39 - Bee: The recipe said I have to knead it and leave it for another hour.
09/04/2020, 13:39 - Bee: Now we wait some more
09/04/2020, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: Plenty of rest... That's nice. I ended up watching a lot of cooking videos and the amount of kneading could be a workout on its own
09/04/2020, 13:43 - Bee: It was. I didn't have a handheld mixer so I had to do it on my own
09/04/2020, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: Exercise for today done!
09/04/2020, 13:50 - Bee: Yay!
09/04/2020, 13:50 - Bee: The Sally up challenge or the app workout?
09/04/2020, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I meant for you with the donuts
09/04/2020, 13:51 - Bee: OH 😂
09/04/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Yes
09/04/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I have a lecture in 10 min
09/04/2020, 13:54 - Bee: Oh
09/04/2020, 13:54 - Bee: How long?
09/04/2020, 13:54 - Bee: Can we talk tonight? If you're free
09/04/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's for 2 hours. I should be free after that for the rest of the day. Don't you have your Bible study today?
09/04/2020, 13:55 - Bee: Yes. 7:30-8:30
09/04/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that fits in fine. Yea let me know when you're free and I probably should be too
09/04/2020, 14:00 - Bee: Okay :)
09/04/2020, 17:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>

09/04/2020, 17:30 - Bee: It wasn't a flop Nischal 😭
09/04/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Everybody loved it!
09/04/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: They sure look delicious 😋
09/04/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Congratulations on another new item cooked!! 😁. How do you glaze it?
09/04/2020, 18:09 - Bee: They are 🤤
09/04/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Made the glaze with milk, butter, sugar, a pinch of salt, and vanilla essence
09/04/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Dipped the donuts in he glaze and left them on the rack to dry
09/04/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: So that was dinner for tonight?
09/04/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Mixed vegetable, Dal, and rice
09/04/2020, 18:35 - Bee: What was for lunch?
09/04/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Egg and a sandwich with apple juice
09/04/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Oh
09/04/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Filling?
09/04/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yep!
09/04/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Cool
09/04/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free to talk whenever you are. Just let me know when you're free
09/04/2020, 18:56 - Bee: I need to take a head bath. I'm free after that. Going in now. Bye!
09/04/2020, 18:56 - Bee: So in 30 minutes?
09/04/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Latest
09/04/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sure sure. I'm not on a time limit
09/04/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Hey
09/04/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: Hello
09/04/2020, 19:40 - Bee: I'll call?
09/04/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
09/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: You were confident that the donuts would turn out okay but not that I would continue learning the ukulele. Nice
09/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: I didn't mean for it to sound passive aggressive
09/04/2020, 21:18 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
09/04/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know why I just thought of playing an instrument like working out. But I'm glad you're keeping at it Debby!! I really miss being able to play and instrument and it's really cool you can and are learning to!
09/04/2020, 21:21 - Bee: At least one of us finds it funny
09/04/2020, 21:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry. There is a reason I'm skeptical about it... Most people I know never learn music even when they have an instrument at home. And I get really excited about this when I do see people who take the effort to learn one you know... But I've learnt to control my emotions and not let them take over how u converse with people
09/04/2020, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: Cause the people who are more excited than I am about music and instruments (insert Achu and Sammy) can go overboard even for me... So I'm sure I probably do the same for others and put them off from it
09/04/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: And I NEVER want to put someone off from learning an instrument or doing something musical. I think it's wonderful when people do
10/04/2020, 07:15 - Bee: Nischal can I give you my reply whenever we talk next? I think I'll mess it up if I reply in a text message
10/04/2020, 07:21 - Bee: But I don't know when we'll talk next
10/04/2020, 07:26 - Bee: In a way I look up to you when it comes to music. Because you're the person I'm closest to who also plays an instrument and sings and because know stuff I can share all the doubts I have. So when you were surprised/in disbelief that I'm still trying to learn, it kinda put a damper my confidence/motivation to learn.
10/04/2020, 07:26 - Bee: Because what you think matters.
10/04/2020, 07:27 - Bee: And about you toning down your excitement... Please don't hold back your emotions for my sake Nischal
10/04/2020, 07:37 - Bee: But now that I think about it... Me 'looking up' to you may put pressure on you with I don't want. I'll think of a solution
10/04/2020, 07:37 - Bee: Which*
10/04/2020, 10:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm really sorry! I didn't intend for it to be such a serious remark. Honestly it is exciting for me to hear you're going for it and learning to play the uke
10/04/2020, 10:46 - Bee: I'm sorry if I'm making a big deal out of nothing
10/04/2020, 10:46 - Bee: That I'm*
10/04/2020, 10:49 - Nischal Abraham: Well you can't help being passionate about something
10/04/2020, 10:50 - Bee: I guess so
10/04/2020, 17:08 - Bee: Hey!
10/04/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Helloo
10/04/2020, 17:34 - Bee: How's your day going?
10/04/2020, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good. Managed to make something for lunch. Spent time preparing for the Bible study later tonight
10/04/2020, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: Which is what I just finished doing. How's yours been?
10/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: That's good 😊
10/04/2020, 17:36 - Bee: My day was alright. Assignments, then a nap. Had the family thing on zoom. Having dinner now
10/04/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
10/04/2020, 17:45 - Bee: There's rice, rajma curry, and fried chicken
10/04/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds amazing 🤤
10/04/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: How much of that did you make?
10/04/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Nothing actually. I went for a run after Zoom
10/04/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Mother made everything
10/04/2020, 18:03 - Bee: No wait I marinated the chicken in the afternoon
10/04/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Does that count?
10/04/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Sure :). Did you sleep well last night? I ended up sleeping for 10 hours in total
10/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: I slept alright... slept for 6ish hours. But I did take a nap
10/04/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have lectures tomorrow as well?
10/04/2020, 18:20 - Bee: No lectures. Just assignments
10/04/2020, 18:20 - Bee: I'll be done by 4
10/04/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... any progress on the handstand at your end?
10/04/2020, 18:22 - Bee: 😂
10/04/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Nothing ya.
10/04/2020, 18:22 - Bee: I'm settling for a headstand first. I'll try a handstand after
10/04/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like I may just win the bet 😉
10/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: How far are you?
10/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Give me resources Nischal! 😇🤗🥰☺️
10/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: 😛
10/04/2020, 18:28 - Bee: Are you able to do it against a wall yet?
10/04/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. I've made no real progress towards doing it any better than I first did
10/04/2020, 18:29 - Bee: ?!?!??
10/04/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Just exercising for upper body strength really. Pushups and trying to hold a handstand with my feet against the wall
10/04/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'm all talk 😂
10/04/2020, 18:30 - Bee: Until you do one before me!!
10/04/2020, 18:30 - Bee: I don't like upper body exercises. I have zero upper body strength
10/04/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Same. But since the challenge stands I push myself to do it
10/04/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: These days I feel I have zero lower body strength too... It's been so long since I've played football
10/04/2020, 19:09 - Bee: I have some lower body strength.. been going for walks. But I can't do push ups
10/04/2020, 19:09 - Bee: I shall too.
10/04/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Just you wait.
10/04/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: I'm waiting. Till the day I can do it myself
10/04/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Turns out I was mistaken and the Bible study is tomorrow
10/04/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Which will be after the day I do it
10/04/2020, 19:28 - Bee: 😃
10/04/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Oh. You have more time to prepare then
10/04/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Played two rounds of skribbl
10/04/2020, 19:36 - Bee: It's a fun game. You should join the next time we play
10/04/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Ah! You could've asked me to join then na 😂
10/04/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I don't mind joining next time. If the others are okay with it
10/04/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Oh noooo

10/04/2020, 19:38 - Bee: What time is Bible study tomorrow?

10/04/2020, 19:40 - Bee: What's up?
10/04/2020, 19:40 - Bee: How are you?
10/04/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Should I add you to the group where we decide when we're playing?
10/04/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm good. Now that there's no Bible study I'll probably sleep earlier
10/04/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Okay
10/04/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: If the others are okay with it. I'd love to join along 😊
10/04/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Everyone will be okay with it
10/04/2020, 19:44 - Bee: https://youtu.be/YgbVTUGQju0
10/04/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Silly but funny
10/04/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Do you know that for a fact? Btw which ludo app do yous use?
10/04/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Ludo king
10/04/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Reenee Rolf Daniel Ashley Jason will definitely be okay with it
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Samson and Sarah mostly yes
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Joy doesn't know you
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Haha I've seen this one. Really funny 😂
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: He's a doctor working in Bethany
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Around your age I think
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: It is!!
10/04/2020, 19:45 - Bee: This one
10/04/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'm looking for that on the app store
10/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Should I share the link
10/04/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Maybe Joy won't be okay with me joining then...
10/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ludo.king
10/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: But he doesn't even know you
10/04/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly!
10/04/2020, 19:50 - Bee: 😑
10/04/2020, 19:50 - Bee: I'll ask him
10/04/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's only one way to be sure right
10/04/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Really?!
10/04/2020, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just saying... What if there's someone who doesn't want to play with me... It'd be unfair to impose myself on them right?
10/04/2020, 19:55 - Bee: You're not imposing nana
10/04/2020, 19:55 - Bee: Anyone who meets you and talks to you and laughs with you and plays with you will never think you're imposing
10/04/2020, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: Well that's a lot of steps to get through. What if they stop at meets me and don't want to go any further
10/04/2020, 19:57 - Bee: No no those aren't steps
10/04/2020, 19:57 - Bee: Just all the different things one can do to know you're reaaallllyyyy nice.
10/04/2020, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee... You almost make me not want to keep this banter up
10/04/2020, 20:00 - Bee: What. Is that all you've got
10/04/2020, 20:04 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
10/04/2020, 20:14 - Bee: Are you here
10/04/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby!
10/04/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: I was checking out the skribbl game
10/04/2020, 20:15 - Bee: You are!!!!!
10/04/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Lost track of time
10/04/2020, 20:15 - Bee: Okay
10/04/2020, 20:15 - Bee: Bye. ☺️
10/04/2020, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Bye bee... Thanks for getting me into the group 😁
11/04/2020, 10:45 - Bee: Good morning, nanaaaaa!
11/04/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! How fares your day thus far?
11/04/2020, 10:46 - Bee: Thus far my day fareth well
11/04/2020, 10:47 - Bee: Did you take off your hat while saying this
11/04/2020, 10:47 - Bee: How's yours going?
11/04/2020, 10:48 - Bee: It just started...
11/04/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: It just started... Done with breakfast. I should go shopping before lunch. There's a family video call in the afternoon and Bible study at night so it's a packed day today
11/04/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: Sadly I wasn't wearing a hat
11/04/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: How's the assignments going? On a break?
11/04/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Extended family? Sounds fun :)
11/04/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Not on a break. There's stuff I'm supposed to be doing
11/04/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Almost done for today
11/04/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. From my dad's side. There'll be so many people I have no clue existed 😂
11/04/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. I'm dreading to start the day
11/04/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Hahahaha
11/04/2020, 10:59 - Bee: At least you won't have to remember all the names since they'll be written
11/04/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Why?
11/04/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Haha yea!
11/04/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: It's cloudy and looks like it's going to rain... On the one day I decide to go shopping 😑
11/04/2020, 11:03 - Bee: Cherish the sound of rain hitting the ground
11/04/2020, 11:05 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/04/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well the rain hasn't started so it's just uncertainty at this point
11/04/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: According to Google the rain is only at night but it doesn't look that way
11/04/2020, 11:08 - Bee: You gotta hurry then
11/04/2020, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: Or wait it out?
11/04/2020, 11:10 - Bee: What if it looks like that the whole day but rains only at night?
11/04/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's what I'm thinking. Well regardless of rain or not I need to go shop. So might as well go now
11/04/2020, 11:15 - Bee: Oops
11/04/2020, 11:15 - Bee: Nischal*
11/04/2020, 11:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/04/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun with your assignments! I'm off
11/04/2020, 11:15 - Bee: Bye
11/04/2020, 18:40 - Bee: YOU'RE SO GOOD AT IT NANA
11/04/2020, 18:40 - Bee: How
11/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Why
11/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Whhhyyyy
11/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Since Reenee wasn't there, I thought I would win because Reenee always wins
11/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: But no!
11/04/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry nana. Next time I'll lose
11/04/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Okay
11/04/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I'll remind you
11/04/2020, 18:47 - Bee: I didn't take a nap. And went for a long run. I'll go to bed early
11/04/2020, 18:47 - Bee: How's your day going?
11/04/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Is that really how you want to win? What happened to your competitive side?
11/04/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Because then you won't do it and then I'll really win
11/04/2020, 18:48 - Bee: It=try to lose
11/04/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: That's grand... My days been good. The family call was a bit overwhelming with sooo many people I don't know
11/04/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: But it was nice seeing faces to a lot of names I've heard my dad mention to me
11/04/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Oh! Did you get to talk at all?
11/04/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Or was it all introducing?
11/04/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I talked like for introduction.
11/04/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not much of a talker anyway
11/04/2020, 18:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/04/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I hope the Bible study goes well :)
11/04/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
11/04/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee. Goodnight! I mean I don't talk much  in a group
11/04/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: And you're always the exception Debby :)
11/04/2020, 18:54 - Bee: How was the grocery trip? Did you get whatever you needed?
11/04/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Awwwwwww. ☺️🥰

12/04/2020, 20:34 - Bee: Bye. ☺️
12/04/2020, 20:34 - Nischal Abraham: Byee!
12/04/2020, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/nORRgU8sGdE
13/04/2020, 08:16 - Bee: People are so creative and skilled
13/04/2020, 08:16 - Bee: 😍
13/04/2020, 08:16 - Bee: But what if he wants some more salt?!
13/04/2020, 08:17 - Bee: The hair dryer blowing the ball upwards is my favorite part
13/04/2020, 08:18 - Bee: Mind=blown

13/04/2020, 12:03 - Nischal Abraham: https://gmb.io/handstand/#handstand-concepts

One of the resources I've found. It's pretty in-depth but looks helpful. Good luck!
13/04/2020, 12:11 - Bee: Are you helping me? 😯
13/04/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Sharing the resource. It's upto you whether it'll be helpful or not
13/04/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Ookay
13/04/2020, 14:39 - Bee: Nischal
13/04/2020, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. What up?
13/04/2020, 16:21 - Bee: What's up?
13/04/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Ceiling
13/04/2020, 16:26 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/04/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Sleepy?
13/04/2020, 16:50 - Bee: No. Bored
13/04/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Wait yes
13/04/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Listening to your answer
13/04/2020, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: 😅. But seriously what're you up to?
13/04/2020, 16:56 - Bee: I'm going to have dinner
13/04/2020, 16:57 - Bee: I made the chapatis all by myself
13/04/2020, 16:57 - Bee: The frying (still know the word for it) and the rolling (this one too)
13/04/2020, 16:57 - Bee: The shapes are terrible but they taste the same
13/04/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Kneaded the dough too?
13/04/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: As long as they taste fine I'm sure no one really cares 😁
13/04/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't you say the shapes are getting rounded?
13/04/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Rounder*
13/04/2020, 17:13 - Bee: 😳 no
13/04/2020, 17:14 - Bee: Yes but that's when I'm doing only the rolling not the frying
13/04/2020, 17:14 - Bee: Today I did both at the same time
13/04/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Ah but nothing burnt this time! Progress is small increments :)
13/04/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Yes!! :)

14/04/2020, 19:04 - Bee: Maybe on a call with just you she won't be so shy
14/04/2020, 19:04 - Bee: She usually isn't so shy
14/04/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: It was a call with just me for 20 min before everyone else! 😅
14/04/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
14/04/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just have to call more often till she gets used to talking to me 😤
14/04/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Yes!!

15/04/2020, 09:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/04/2020, 09:31 - Bee: Precious blood has left me forgiven
Pure like the whitest of snow
Powerful to make sin and shame retreat
This covenant is making me whole
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest Name has set me free
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
Purify my heart in Your presence
Teach me to discover the joy
Of holiness that forms as You draw me close
In You what was lost is restored
15/04/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby! Thanks for sharing the song. I liked it 😊

15/04/2020, 22:02 - Bee: It was a fun time!!
15/04/2020, 22:02 - Bee: Nidhi and Manjiri are so gracious with me
15/04/2020, 22:03 - Bee: Especially during the workouts... I do half of what they're doing and still they're like You're doing good. I shave tears of joy on the inside
15/04/2020, 22:03 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! All 3 of you were playing side by side!?

15/04/2020, 22:04 - Bee: Cool. I'll continue doing half of whatever they're doing
15/04/2020, 22:05 - Nischal Abraham: But you're starting Debby! I'm glad you're keeping at it... Even if its just 10 min everyday it's progress towards building a habit
15/04/2020, 22:05 - Bee: Yes I hope I stick with it
15/04/2020, 22:05 - Bee: I'm nicely tired by the end of the day. Gives me good sleep
15/04/2020, 22:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I mean not anymore... But Manjiri used to be in the swim team in school

16/04/2020, 20:38 - Bee: My day went well :)
16/04/2020, 20:39 - Bee: We made ice cream today!!

16/04/2020, 20:39 - Bee: How are you?
16/04/2020, 20:40 - Bee: What did you do today?
16/04/2020, 20:40 - Bee: Have you finished dinner?
16/04/2020, 20:41 - Bee: We watched Wall-E today. A must watch movie according to Nidhi
16/04/2020, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: So I heard. I didn't even know my mom could make ice cream
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing good 😊
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: Assignments, lunch, attended Bible study, played games with y'all
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: Just did
16/04/2020, 20:43 - Nischal Abraham: You hadn't seen it before? I don't buy in to must watch movies anymore. There's so many of them you'll spend your whole life not fulfilling it
16/04/2020, 20:43 - Nischal Abraham: But Wall-E is a nice movie to watch ☺️
16/04/2020, 20:44 - Nischal Abraham: You've had an exciting day as well it seems! Looks like you've got assistance on the handstand exercise 😮
16/04/2020, 20:45 - Bee: Oh
16/04/2020, 20:45 - Bee: Did you hear me speak out loud in the end?
16/04/2020, 20:45 - Bee: I didn't know it was unmuted
16/04/2020, 20:45 - Bee: So embarrassing Nischal!!!!!
16/04/2020, 20:46 - Bee: What was for dinner?
16/04/2020, 20:46 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. You just shrunk away from the camera
16/04/2020, 20:46 - Nischal Abraham: That was so cute!
16/04/2020, 20:46 - Bee: I hadn't. It's a nice movie. I wasn't satisfied with the ending. But they made up with the scene during the credits
16/04/2020, 20:47 - Bee: Was I still seen? I don't know because it was on speaker view!!!!
16/04/2020, 20:47 - Nischal Abraham: Tortilla wraps
16/04/2020, 20:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well the speaker on focus was you guys
16/04/2020, 20:47 - Bee: Hahaha we tried it once. And a headstand...not a handstand
16/04/2020, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: Wait what's wrong with the normal ending? They grow pizza in the end right? I didn't even know there's a credits scene
16/04/2020, 21:14 - Bee: They grow pizza?!
16/04/2020, 21:15 - Bee: No they just plant the sapling and a child waters it
16/04/2020, 21:15 - Bee: I have this presentation tomorrow
16/04/2020, 21:15 - Bee: A seminar
16/04/2020, 21:15 - Bee: I have to take the seminar
It's a requirement for one of the subjects
16/04/2020, 21:15 - Bee: I was working on it but I can't now too tired
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: And sleepy
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: I want to wake up earlier than usual
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Please pray that I do
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: 7 is also okay
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: Online seminar might not be too bad. You should sleep now if you want to wake early
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Yes I'm going to sleep now
16/04/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying Debby!
16/04/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure it'll go swimmingly
16/04/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Thank you Nischal :)
16/04/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! ☺️
16/04/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Goodnight :)))))
17/04/2020, 11:41 - Bee: NISCHAL!!!!!!!!!
17/04/2020, 11:42 - Bee: The seminar went well!!!!!!!!!!
17/04/2020, 11:42 - Bee: My teacher was impressed
17/04/2020, 11:42 - Bee: I know it's God's grace and your prayers too
17/04/2020, 11:42 - Bee: Thank you for praying :))))))
17/04/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God!! I'm happy for you 😊. So relaxed day now?
17/04/2020, 12:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/04/2020, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Nice... What's cooking today?
17/04/2020, 14:49 - Bee: Nithiy?
17/04/2020, 14:49 - Bee: Nothing*
17/04/2020, 14:49 - Bee: Aunty made everything today
17/04/2020, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a good day 😊. I tried getting up early today and now I'm so tired
17/04/2020, 16:20 - Bee: Yes. But I didn't exercise today I fell asleep in the evening
17/04/2020, 16:20 - Bee: Woke up early and couldn't stay awake
17/04/2020, 16:21 - Bee: Bible study today?
17/04/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. In the evening. I'm planning on going shopping before that
17/04/2020, 16:25 - Bee: Oh
17/04/2020, 16:26 - Bee: Shortlist recipes!
17/04/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: Recipes for?
17/04/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Stuff you want to try and need ingredients for so that you can buy them today on your shopping trip
17/04/2020, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... But I'm not sure what I want to try
17/04/2020, 16:32 - Bee: Okay
17/04/2020, 16:32 - Bee: Anything you're craving?
17/04/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. I'm considering it an achievement to just eat 3 meals a day at this point
17/04/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Oh
17/04/2020, 16:52 - Bee: It is
17/04/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks 😅. Well I'm off. If you happen to fall asleep before I'm online again... Goodnight Debby!
17/04/2020, 17:34 - Bee: No I won't fall asleep
17/04/2020, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: So it seems. Well I take it back then
17/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Cool
17/04/2020, 18:18 - Bee: I am in awe of Nidhi
17/04/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: Exercise?
17/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: That
17/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: And art stuff
17/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: And humor
17/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: And innocence
17/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: And many things
17/04/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi is sweet 😁
17/04/2020, 18:21 - Bee: The sweetest.
17/04/2020, 20:04 - Bee: Hi Nischal
17/04/2020, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby. Bible study starting
17/04/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Okay!
17/04/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
17/04/2020, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! 😊
17/04/2020, 20:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/04/2020, 20:24 - Bee: I know you're busy 
Just ignore this now
Found it and I wanted to share it with you
Tiny Norah
Okay bye
17/04/2020, 20:24 - Bee: Also ignore my face
17/04/2020, 23:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's Norah!? She's so cuuute!
17/04/2020, 23:52 - Nischal Abraham: You look terrifying btw. I'm surprised she's smiling
18/04/2020, 05:29 - Bee: What part of ignore my face did you not understand 😂
18/04/2020, 05:29 - Bee: She is!!!!!!
18/04/2020, 05:30 - Bee: Donuts are happening
18/04/2020, 05:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/04/2020, 05:32 - Bee: Maybe she thought that if she can't see anybody then nobody can see her
18/04/2020, 11:45 - Bee: Are you http? Because without you I'm just ://
18/04/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't that how it works?
18/04/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: What's wrong with ://?
18/04/2020, 13:55 - Bee: You want me to be 😕?
18/04/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: OH! I didn't realise that stood for the smiley
18/04/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you want to be 😕 who am I to put a damper on your dreams
18/04/2020, 15:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/04/2020, 15:16 - Nischal Abraham: Cause you've already picked me up Debby 😏
18/04/2020, 15:17 - Bee: But I didn't use pick up lines
18/04/2020, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: Well you didn't need them
18/04/2020, 15:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/04/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
18/04/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Your GIFs remind me of Daniel
18/04/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: He's so good with those 😮
18/04/2020, 15:20 - Bee: Ikr?!?!?!?!!?!
18/04/2020, 15:20 - Bee: I don't know how he finds them
18/04/2020, 15:20 - Bee: They good well with the ongoing conversation
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: Go*
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: I wonder if he has a folder full of them in his gallery
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: He might
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: I'll ask
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Or I think you could just search them with Google keyboard right?
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: 😂
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: You could yes
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: But he gets these sentence ones
18/04/2020, 15:21 - Bee: Or maybe he remembers dialogues and looks them up
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yea and so quickly too. I'd spend 10 min just finding something relevant
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Bee: Hahahaha
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Bee: What's up?
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Bee: We made donuts Nischal!!!!!!!
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Bee: All the photos are in Nidhis phone
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: Was it better than the ones you made before?
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Bee: I made her pose at every step because I wanted to remember everything
18/04/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: I saw photos of them. My mom shared them
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Definitely yes
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Ahh
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Bee: The dough rose well
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: I only have the finished product
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Made 26 donuts. I used the same measurements and made only 18 the last time
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: Why was she posing? 😂
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Because I asked her to
18/04/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Sahil made them at the same time there
18/04/2020, 15:24 - Bee: All on video call
18/04/2020, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I know. Mom shared that too
18/04/2020, 15:24 - Bee: Oh
18/04/2020, 15:24 - Bee: Cool
18/04/2020, 15:24 - Bee: I'm watching this is us rn
18/04/2020, 15:24 - Bee: Waiting for Nidhi to wake up
18/04/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: I though Nidhi was done with her odd sleeping pattern for this sem
18/04/2020, 15:26 - Bee: She slept late last night and we started the donuts around 7 today. She didn't get enough sleep
18/04/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. How many more seasons of this is us to go?
18/04/2020, 15:30 - Bee: I'm on the second. There are 4 seasons
18/04/2020, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh you're taking it slow. That's nice
18/04/2020, 15:46 - Bee: This is the first time I'm watching since I came here
18/04/2020, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Cause you cry too much?
18/04/2020, 15:47 - Bee: No I haven't found the time to watch
18/04/2020, 15:47 - Bee: I thought you said there's no 'too much' crying
18/04/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: Did I? I don't remember. But I would stand by it in a sense. It's all subjective though. Who defines too much?
18/04/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Not me
18/04/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Do you?
18/04/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: Shouldn't it be by the person who's doing the crying?
18/04/2020, 15:50 - Bee: Yes you make sense
18/04/2020, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to know 😂. I hope I'm not disturbing your watching
18/04/2020, 15:53 - Bee: No you're not nana
18/04/2020, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Well if I drop off chat all of a sudden don't mind me... I'm waiting on a for college
18/04/2020, 15:55 - Bee: Call for college? Is that what you're saying?
18/04/2020, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: Call yes 😂. I didn't realise that wasn't typed in
18/04/2020, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: Wow I'm surprised you infered that
18/04/2020, 15:57 - Bee: 😂
18/04/2020, 15:58 - Bee: One step towards finishing each others sentences (if we can call this that)
And then we sing the song
18/04/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Which song?
18/04/2020, 15:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/04/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Ah the not true love song where the villain deceives the princess into thinking they're in love
18/04/2020, 16:00 - Bee: It's a cute song
18/04/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Do you have another song in mind?
18/04/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Na it is a cute song. I'm just pulling your leg
18/04/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Cool. You have time until the next time we meet to learn the lyrics
18/04/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Unless you know them already
18/04/2020, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: Do you!?
18/04/2020, 16:04 - Bee: I'm not watching will all my attention and I'm still crying Nischal
18/04/2020, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: Then you should be watching with all your attention! I thought it's a good show
18/04/2020, 16:05 - Bee: It is a good show!!!!
18/04/2020, 16:05 - Bee: I have to go take a bath
18/04/2020, 16:06 - Bee: I do!!!
18/04/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: I only remember the sandwiches line from the song
18/04/2020, 16:09 - Bee: You have homework to do
18/04/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: It shouldn't take too long. Songs are easier than marathons
18/04/2020, 16:10 - Bee: That's why 5 years for the marathon
18/04/2020, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: 5 years for 5km
18/04/2020, 16:20 - Bee: 10?
18/04/2020, 16:20 - Bee: Km
18/04/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: 10 for 5km?
18/04/2020, 18:14 - Bee: 5 for 10?
18/04/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: That's still not a half marathon though
18/04/2020, 19:39 - Bee: We can do the half if you want
18/04/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Starting with a 5k is better
18/04/2020, 19:39 - Bee: I'm barely able to do Nidhis 15 minute workout
18/04/2020, 19:39 - Bee: 😂
18/04/2020, 19:58 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi's workouts are intense so I'd be impressed if you manage to keep up with all of it
18/04/2020, 20:33 - Bee: I can't
18/04/2020, 20:33 - Bee: Manjiri came over. We watched a movie
18/04/2020, 20:33 - Bee: Going to sleep now.
18/04/2020, 20:34 - Bee: I'd never play hide and seek with you because someone like you is impossible to find.
18/04/2020, 20:34 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal! ☺️
18/04/2020, 20:45 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee. I had a really good comeback for that one but I think I'll let it slide for now 😁
19/04/2020, 10:23 - Bee: Tell me!!!!
19/04/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Tell you what?
19/04/2020, 11:02 - Bee: Your comeback
19/04/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: But you did find me so doesn't that mean it was possible?
19/04/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Ummmmmmmmm yes
19/04/2020, 12:37 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/04/2020, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. Yes you did
19/04/2020, 13:16 - Bee: Maybe finding you again will be impossible
19/04/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Hi Nischal
19/04/2020, 19:24 - Bee: I hope you're having a good day!
19/04/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
19/04/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee. I'm sorry I haven't been very active in replying today. I hope your day was good too 😊
20/04/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I hope you have an amazing day today 😁
20/04/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. ☺️
20/04/2020, 10:29 - Bee: I hope you have a good day too
20/04/2020, 10:29 - Bee: What are you gonna do today?
20/04/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Did you sleep well?
20/04/2020, 11:16 - Bee: I like that you talk a lot when we're on the phone. And that you don't push me to talk unless I want to. (one day I'm going to talk more than you)
I like that being best friends comes first for you. It comes first for me too.
I like that I have the freedom to tell you anything. No matter how ordinary it is
I like it that you're cheesy without even trying
I like that you put God before anything and anyone else. Especially in this relationship
I like that you're good at skribbl
I like the way you sound when you laugh
I like that you've given me a nickname
And there are so many more things. I'll tell you someday
You really are amazing. Even if you don't agree
Have a good day, Nischal.
20/04/2020, 14:45 - Nischal Abraham: "10 things I like about you"?
20/04/2020, 14:45 - Nischal Abraham: You're making me cry mid afternoon Debby
20/04/2020, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: In a sense. It was deep sleep but not very long
20/04/2020, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: Easter week is done so more assignments incoming
20/04/2020, 16:51 - Bee: I typed 10 things?
20/04/2020, 16:51 - Bee: There are only 10
20/04/2020, 16:51 - Bee: Hahaha I'd like to see that
20/04/2020, 16:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/04/2020, 16:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/04/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: I must is true. Whether I can or can't will be seen
20/04/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: I was making a reference to 10 things I hate about you
20/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: *8
20/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Got that. I haven't mentioned 10 things though
20/04/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal!
20/04/2020, 20:39 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! Or it may just be good morning when you read this. Just finished with my dinner
21/04/2020, 05:52 - Bee: Good morning. :))))))
21/04/2020, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Good evening! How's your day been?
21/04/2020, 14:32 - Bee: My day's been good Nischal
21/04/2020, 14:32 - Bee: I finished assignments by 4. Spoke to Reenee after a long time
21/04/2020, 14:33 - Bee: How's your day going?
21/04/2020, 14:33 - Bee: I regret cutting my hair
21/04/2020, 14:33 - Nischal Abraham: Worked on assignments in the morning. Just finished an hour long talk with parents
21/04/2020, 14:33 - Bee: Oh!!
21/04/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: Why?
21/04/2020, 14:48 - Bee: Long hair looked prettier
21/04/2020, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: You look pretty either way Debby 😊. Hair length is temporary anyway. It'll grow back so there's no need to regret it
21/04/2020, 16:56 - Bee: You haven't seen me in person
21/04/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Yes it'll grow. And I'm not going to cut it again for a while
21/04/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Radhika (the gospel contact I told you about) has been asking me doubts from the Bible and the portions that she's reading... She's reading the book of Romans now
21/04/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I'm anxious, scared because I've never done this before... studying the Bible and explaining it to an unbeliever
21/04/2020, 17:20 - Bee: Please pray for me that God uses me as His mouthpiece and that I don't use any of my wisdom or knowledge
21/04/2020, 17:20 - Bee: I don't want to be a stumbling block to her
21/04/2020, 18:22 - Bee: I hope you're having a productive day, Nischal. It's in your hands. It always seems impossible until it's done.
21/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: I'm praying for you. I miss you.
21/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
21/04/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: True I haven't seen you. But you are pretty either way.

I'll be praying for you and for Radhika. It's a blessing to be in that position Debby. I'm excited for you 😊. I know it can be scary, and there's a lot of responsibility attached to it. But as long as you're aware that it's God and His spirit that's working and not you, then you'll be praying in the right direction. I'll be praying in that direction too
21/04/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I actually am. Part of which took up the last 2 hours of my life
21/04/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I appreciate every prayer you make for me Debby. Thank you!
21/04/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby. I hope your day was amazing
22/04/2020, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
22/04/2020, 10:32 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!
22/04/2020, 10:33 - Bee: You'll obviously say that nana
22/04/2020, 10:34 - Bee: Yay!!!
22/04/2020, 10:34 - Bee: :))))
22/04/2020, 10:50 - Bee: Thank you. I'm going to pray like that too
22/04/2020, 10:51 - Bee: I'm excited too!! I have this front seat view to an unbeliever becoming a believer (that's what I'm praying happens)
22/04/2020, 10:51 - Bee: NISCHAL!!!!!! IM IMPRESSED
22/04/2020, 10:51 - Bee: How's the back though? Since you can't see it while trimming
22/04/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Did you use your trimmer or scissors?
22/04/2020, 11:02 - Bee: The curls are gone. Looks a little pointy. But these are all afterthoughts
22/04/2020, 11:02 - Bee: My first thought was - Oh Nischal is looking so handsome!!!!
22/04/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Since I can't see it I care even less. I used my scissors for the most part cause my trimmer didn't seem to cut long hair very well. On one side though I had the comb too low so there's a section where it's trimmed very close
22/04/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: But overall I just chopped hair off till it felt okay when I run my hands over it. So one good thing about having long hair is... It's easy to make out the parts which hasn't been cut
22/04/2020, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: So whichever strand of hair was long when I held it met the wrath of my scissors
22/04/2020, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: That usually happens when my hair is short. It's also my indicator for when I need a haircut
22/04/2020, 11:17 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby. You make me blush ☺️
22/04/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yes!! It's incredible just thinking about it. That's what I'm praying happens too
22/04/2020, 11:26 - Bee: Oh wow you did that with scissors
22/04/2020, 11:26 - Bee: Cool
22/04/2020, 11:26 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/04/2020, 11:28 - Bee: Hahaha I'm imagining the wrath part
22/04/2020, 11:29 - Bee: We made lemon cake today!! The texture is amazing. A little heavy on the lemon tho. We added a glaze on top
22/04/2020, 11:38 - Bee: And we made chicken sukka!! Mostly Shirly aunty tho
22/04/2020, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: That's a lot of impressed to be 😅
22/04/2020, 12:28 - Nischal Abraham: I thought that was next week. Sounds delicious! 😭
22/04/2020, 12:28 - Nischal Abraham: My dad said you'd be teaching him how to make it
22/04/2020, 12:42 - Bee: No we made it today because there was no other dessert for Joji uncle
22/04/2020, 12:42 - Bee: I didn't teach anyone. I read the recipe out loud and uncle and aunty made it. All I did was check for the salt :P
22/04/2020, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: The most important part of making any dish of you ask me
22/04/2020, 14:55 - Bee: Achha
22/04/2020, 14:55 - Bee: If all you're going to do is checking for the salt then we may have differences
22/04/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Why would I be checking it. I barely know anything about cooking... It should be the one who knows more who should be checking the salt content
22/04/2020, 16:54 - Bee: No? Joji uncle doesn't know how to cook but he gives good feedback about the salt content
22/04/2020, 16:55 - Bee: I can manage a few dishes but I always get the salt content wrong
22/04/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe Joji uncle does know how to cook but pretends not to so that others will cook for him 😮
22/04/2020, 19:01 - Bee: What? Noooo
22/04/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Should I ask him
22/04/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Maybe I will
22/04/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Well he won't give you a straight answer either way so no point in asking him
22/04/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Always is a very frequent term. Even the Dal?
22/04/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Yes. I ask papa to check the salt
22/04/2020, 19:55 - Bee: Bye!
22/04/2020, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I was attending our CU call for the week
23/04/2020, 05:35 - Bee: Ahhh... What was it about?
23/04/2020, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Discussion on the wedding at Cana. No special speaker as such, just nice to see people after a long time.
23/04/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Hasn't it been more than a month?
23/04/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Long time ya
23/04/2020, 11:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
23/04/2020, 11:44 - Bee: It was goooooood!
23/04/2020, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: 🤤. It looks soooo good!
23/04/2020, 11:45 - Bee: We took so long to make it tho
23/04/2020, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: Is it complicated?
23/04/2020, 11:46 - Bee: It is
23/04/2020, 11:46 - Bee: There were noodles for lunch. So the combination was amazing
23/04/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds delicious. Feels like I'm missing out on a lot
23/04/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: Btw are my parents asleep?
23/04/2020, 11:48 - Bee: You are nana
23/04/2020, 11:49 - Bee: I do not know... The door to their room is shut
23/04/2020, 11:49 - Bee: I'll check?
23/04/2020, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool. No no that's fine
23/04/2020, 11:49 - Bee: Okay
23/04/2020, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Usually afternoon nap time is till 5 so I was just confirming
23/04/2020, 11:49 - Bee: Okay
23/04/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been? Done with college work for today?
23/04/2020, 12:13 - Bee: My day was alright. Done with college work. I should start studying for my exams
23/04/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Oh my exams are postponed. Supposed to be from June 3rd but now it'll be after June 15th. The dates haven't come out yet
23/04/2020, 12:14 - Bee: I have a lot of time to prepare. It'll be shame if I don't
23/04/2020, 12:21 - Bee: I went to the kitchen to drink water
23/04/2020, 12:21 - Bee: The tv in the room is on
23/04/2020, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! I gave them a call anyway. They were awake
23/04/2020, 14:43 - Bee: Okayy
23/04/2020, 14:43 - Bee: Nanaaaaa
23/04/2020, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: That's good news. More time to prepare. And it isn't too far delayed for it to bleed into anything else after either
23/04/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like something I tell myself 😂
23/04/2020, 17:13 - Bee: 😂
23/04/2020, 17:13 - Bee: How's the khichdi?
23/04/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: It was good! I missed out on water though
23/04/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: So it ended up being dry khichdi
23/04/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Oh did you finish all of it?
23/04/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: No no. There's still enough for 2 more people left
23/04/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Maybe you can add water when you reheat for next time?
23/04/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep that's the plan. Mom already called to tell me that 😂
23/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Oh hahahaha
23/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: It will work
23/04/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: What was today's exotic dish there?
23/04/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Nothing exotic. Just noodles and the potato thing for lunch
23/04/2020, 18:20 - Bee: And we had the lemon cake with fresh cream because it was too lemon-y. It was GOOOOOOD
23/04/2020, 18:20 - Bee: Better than having it plain
23/04/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Dessert somehow ends up being better with ice cream. Where did you get ice cream from?
23/04/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Not ice cream. Fresh cream. Amul fresh cream? Which comes in a tetra pack?
23/04/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: OH! Aren't those sweet? Or am I thinking of condensed milk...
23/04/2020, 18:22 - Bee: No that's not too sweet. Condensed milk is. Which comes in a tin
23/04/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool. I have no idea what fresh cream is then
23/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
23/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: No?
23/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Okay
23/04/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I've seen this at home. I've only ever seen it used in stew
23/04/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I dont know what goes into stew but yes this is the one
23/04/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Haha yea. How are you Debby. It's been a while since we talked... I hope you're doing alright :)
23/04/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Just alright?
23/04/2020, 19:13 - Bee: I'm fine :)
23/04/2020, 19:13 - Bee: It has been a while.
23/04/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Do you want to talk?
23/04/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Or did you mean texting talk
23/04/2020, 19:13 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
23/04/2020, 19:14 - Bee: What's new since we last talked?
23/04/2020, 20:19 - Nischal Abraham: I meant talk talk. But I'm sure we'll find time to do that when we can 😊
23/04/2020, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: Well I've started _trying_ to get up earlier in the day. Following a schedule as much as I can. Actually working towards doing my assignments. Yea it's been nice so far this week
23/04/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: But I think my schedule somehow ends up keeping this evening time really busy for me. So I only end up looking at my phone at 8 or 9
23/04/2020, 21:35 - Bee: Tomorrow? Let me know when you're free
23/04/2020, 21:38 - Bee: I was on a call with Ruth and Reenee. It was nice catching up, sharing, and praying
23/04/2020, 21:42 - Bee: Praise God!! I'm happy to hear that
23/04/2020, 21:42 - Bee: You probably won't see these messages until morning
23/04/2020, 21:42 - Bee: Still
23/04/2020, 21:42 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
24/04/2020, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: You were wrong. I only saw those messages in the afternoon 😂. 
Also I'm sorry but I don't think I'll be free for a call today. Got my Bible study in the evening so I'm trying to finish up assignments before then
24/04/2020, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds nice 😊
24/04/2020, 13:03 - Bee: 😂
24/04/2020, 13:03 - Bee: It's okay. Another day then
24/04/2020, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been? What's the new dish today?
24/04/2020, 14:43 - Bee: My day was alright. The routine
24/04/2020, 14:44 - Bee: We had leftovers today
24/04/2020, 14:44 - Bee: Oh but there was a fancy breakfast!!!
24/04/2020, 14:44 - Bee: We may make Momos tomorrow
24/04/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Is your role to salt check again?
24/04/2020, 16:35 - Bee: No I think I'll be the one who folds the momos
24/04/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Fried momos?
24/04/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Nope. Steamed momos
24/04/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: I prefer steamed ones over fried
24/04/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know if I'll get the chance to say this later so goodnight bee! I hope you had a great day today and I should be freeer tomorrow so let me know if we could talk :)
25/04/2020, 03:53 - Bee: ☺️☺️☺️
25/04/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Bb
25/04/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Hi
25/04/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: Helloo!
25/04/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: What's happening?
25/04/2020, 13:14 - Bee: Hi!!!
25/04/2020, 13:14 - Bee: We're making Momos
25/04/2020, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome!! Hope they turn out good!
25/04/2020, 14:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/04/2020, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: That looks so good! 😋. Good job on the folding!!
25/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: Nischal
25/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: I don't think it'll be possible to talk today
25/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: We made churros too!!!!
25/04/2020, 17:44 - Bee: And just finished cleaning the kitchen. Haven't had dinner yet. Nidhi and I are going to watch This is us along with dinner...
25/04/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. It probably works out for the best. I'm sure we'll eventually find a day(🤞🏻it's tomorrow) when we can talk 😁
25/04/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: I saw the pics! You guys actually made a lot!! I didn't realise the sauce was homemade too 😮
25/04/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome!!
25/04/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Tomorrow.
25/04/2020, 19:24 - Bee: It is!!!
25/04/2020, 19:24 - Bee: It's so tasty Nischal
25/04/2020, 19:24 - Bee: And the churros... Amazing
25/04/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Aww I wish I were there! 🤤
25/04/2020, 19:46 - Bee: You would've learnt how to fold them then. Nidhi learnt real quick
25/04/2020, 19:46 - Bee: This is us made me cry again
25/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: I thought maybe I won't cry if I'm watching it with another person but no
25/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: How's your day going, Nischal?
25/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: How was yesterday's Bible study?
25/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Have you had a meeting with your research guide?
25/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Did you finish the khichdi?
25/04/2020, 19:47 - Bee: What's your current favorite song? Or a song you're listening to on repeat
25/04/2020, 19:52 - Bee: What is the most useless thing you've ever bought?
25/04/2020, 19:53 - Bee: Too many questions?
25/04/2020, 19:53 - Bee: You can take your time and answer
25/04/2020, 19:53 - Bee: I'll go to sleep
25/04/2020, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. But I'll answer them in a bit
25/04/2020, 19:54 - Bee: Okay nana
25/04/2020, 19:54 - Bee: Bye! :)
25/04/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I feel so tired today. Thought I could handle extra workouts cause it's Saturday 😕
25/04/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Btw I said goodnight cause it's late for you and idk when you'll be sleeping
25/04/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: I want to be there for the eating not the folding
25/04/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: I still don't see why you think crying is a bad thing
25/04/2020, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good. My last few ones have been actually
25/04/2020, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: Bible study was such a blessing again! I really thank God for every single one of them every week... It's seriously a highlight in the week
25/04/2020, 21:27 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. There's a lot to do... A LOT. I'm just counting small victories but I'm lagging behind... Like extremely lagging behind on work that needs to be done. Anyway I'll explain more when we talk
25/04/2020, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: There's enough for lunch tomorrow. Then it'll be done... Lasted me a good long while
25/04/2020, 21:29 - Nischal Abraham: There's a few of them on repeat really. But I guess the one I always click on everytime I see it is the alphabet song by Chevy
25/04/2020, 21:30 - Nischal Abraham: So it's a lot of Dodie, Chevy, orchestrations by Rush Garcia, and other random songs that pop up when I'm exercising
25/04/2020, 21:32 - Nischal Abraham: One of the things I personally bought would be my cycle helmet. But there's tons of things. I'd have to think up a list of them 😂
25/04/2020, 21:33 - Nischal Abraham: Your questions have never been too many :). I enjoy answering all of them. Sometimes I wish I took more time to so I could give you a proper reply, but then some of the best responses come from spontaneity so I guess it's good I don't take forever to reply to them
25/04/2020, 21:34 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't even read these messages. You read my mind 😮
25/04/2020, 21:35 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you sleep well. And have a wonderful time and day of worship tomorrow. I pray your heart is spirit led and full 😊
26/04/2020, 08:58 - Bee: It's not. Just tiring
26/04/2020, 09:00 - Bee: Mine is this face brush that I bought because I was worried about my face breaking out into many pimples
I never used this
26/04/2020, 09:01 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/04/2020, 09:01 - Bee: I did, Nischal. Worship was good too. Refreshing.
26/04/2020, 12:34 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Sounds like you're having a good :)
26/04/2020, 12:34 - Nischal Abraham: What was special for lunch?
26/04/2020, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: I had a good worship time too... Its a very cloudy day today but I sort of feel nice about it
26/04/2020, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: Except for the fact that its cold enough for me to have my jumper on in my room
26/04/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Organic home grown veggies
26/04/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Aunty's
26/04/2020, 13:18 - Bee: 😊
26/04/2020, 13:18 - Bee: 🤩*
26/04/2020, 13:19 - Bee: It's that cold?!
26/04/2020, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: It's fairly chilly. Not cold as such
26/04/2020, 14:27 - Nischal Abraham: Whaaat!? I didn't even know ma was growing veggies 😮
26/04/2020, 15:50 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/04/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Nice!
26/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Nischal
26/04/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Nidhi and I are watching This is us

26/04/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: If that's okay with you

27/04/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Well goodnight and sweet dreams! Praying for you always 😊
28/04/2020, 04:48 - Bee: Bb
28/04/2020, 05:04 - Bee: Here’s an album for you… Romans Psallos
https://open.spotify.com/album/5TcXSlt06vwdAWFRI7imES?si=ILpnMggESQejp0-vKdVPLg
28/04/2020, 08:52 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/04/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'll check it out
28/04/2020, 08:54 - Bee: Okay
28/04/2020, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Wow this looks like an old timey picture. If it wasn't for Nidhi's face in the corner I'd have guessed it was a photo taken with an old camera
28/04/2020, 08:55 - Bee: Does it?
28/04/2020, 08:55 - Bee: She was wearing Sammy's shoes and wanted to show everyone
28/04/2020, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: I wonder why it's so satisfying wearing bigger shoes for kids 😂
28/04/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Hahaha
28/04/2020, 08:57 - Bee: She also taught me all about Peppa pig. And all of Peppa pig's friends
28/04/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Don't pretend like you don't already know Peppa pig and her friends
28/04/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Hahahaha
28/04/2020, 12:39 - Bee: I know Peppa's family and one of the friends 😂
28/04/2020, 19:18 - Bee: I know you're having a good day.
28/04/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Kill those assignments Nischal!!!
28/04/2020, 19:19 - Bee: And the push ups!
28/04/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Goodnight. For whenever you go to sleep. Read the goodnight when you're going to sleep okay
28/04/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Bye!
29/04/2020, 08:10 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. Please pray that I do complete this thing today. I'm worried though I know I shouldn't be
29/04/2020, 10:58 - Bee: I am praying, Nischal.
29/04/2020, 20:21 - Bee: Hey :). 
Prayed for you. Continuing to pray
29/04/2020, 20:21 - Bee: Goodnight, dearest Nischal.
29/04/2020, 20:21 - Bee: <Media omitted>
30/04/2020, 08:16 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God and thank you so much for praying Debby!! I somehow finished the assignment in time last night and I'm still in disbelief about it 😭
30/04/2020, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: So for now my worry for 1 module is abated. Just 4 others to look after in the meantime. I've got another big submission next week
30/04/2020, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: How has your days been? I'm sorry I haven't found the time to ask you properly ☹️
30/04/2020, 18:31 - Bee: PRAISE GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
All the thanks I can give is definitely not enough but I'm on it
30/04/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Please don't worry about it, Nischal. I'll tell you all of it whenever we talk next and we can't anytime soon that's okay too. Makes the calls sweeter. Don't worry about replying. I'm not going anywhere. 
If you don't mind I'll still message you but you don't have to reply!!
30/04/2020, 18:33 - Bee: And if we can't*
30/04/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: I will never mind you messaging me. And I will try to find every opportunity to reply back as much as I can.
The busier I get, the more clearly I see God's faithfulness and Him working in things around me. It's absolutely incredible Debby. I don't think I have words to describe it. All this just to encourage you to know that our God is a prayer answering ever loving God!
I hope your days have been well and your night is restful. Looking forward to our next conversation (whenever it may be)

01/05/2020, 06:24 - Bee: I am looking forward too!
01/05/2020, 06:25 - Bee: Kill those assignments Nischal!!!!
01/05/2020, 06:25 - Bee: 🗡️🍴⚔️🔪🪓🧨💣🔫⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
01/05/2020, 09:06 - Nischal Abraham: That's pretty aggressive 😂. But I appreciate the sentiment
01/05/2020, 14:48 - Bee: Yes we're making pasta Nischal
01/05/2020, 16:54 - Bee: Hope the big assignment is going okay.
01/05/2020, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yes Nidhi told me. Sounds amazing!
01/05/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: It's going okay. I was trying on working another module today
01/05/2020, 19:11 - Bee: She'll send photos too. I hope the sauce turns out alright
01/05/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Oh. When's your submission?
01/05/2020, 19:12 - Bee: I had a holiday today. Maharashtra day. 1st May
01/05/2020, 19:12 - Bee: I had the family zoom thing today. Refreshing
01/05/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Submission is next week. It's next week for most everything since its the end of the college sem
01/05/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Oh. Biju uncle mentioned something about an online exam. Is that next week too?
01/05/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
01/05/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Just one more week to go. And then you're done!!
01/05/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: No the online exam is at the end of the month. It's the math one I was talking about on our call... Or did I? Anyway only assignment submissions are next week
01/05/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yes! It's over so quick and yet so much time has passed... Your prayers keep me going Debby. Thank you :)
01/05/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I've got my Bible study in a while so just reading through a bit before then. I couldn't make time for it earlier in the week unfortunately
02/05/2020, 06:12 - Bee: Ahh no you didn't
02/05/2020, 06:12 - Bee: How was it?
02/05/2020, 06:13 - Bee: We're making cheese garlic rolls
02/05/2020, 08:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>

02/05/2020, 10:00 - Nischal Abraham: That looks so good!! 😋😋. You guys should start a bakery soon
02/05/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Such a blessing Debby. I absolutely love the Bible study. Highlight of my week every time 😁. Well today is assignment work day. Going to spend all my time on focused work so I'll be offline for most of the day
02/05/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a good one 😊. Enjoy your delicious food 🤤
02/05/2020, 10:41 - Bee: Hahaha. We've been told that
02/05/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Okay. Praying for you.
02/05/2020, 10:42 - Bee: ☺️
02/05/2020, 10:42 - Bee: We're baking butter cookies too
02/05/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Okay done. Bye!
03/05/2020, 08:47 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
03/05/2020, 08:47 - Bee: I hope you have a spirit-led time of worship ☺️
03/05/2020, 09:17 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Debby! Thank you. I hope your worship was a wonderful time too. Praying for your day 😊
03/05/2020, 09:20 - Bee: Thank you ☺️
03/05/2020, 20:35 - Bee: This message was deleted
03/05/2020, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!! It was lovely seeing you on call 😊
03/05/2020, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: You and Nidhi are cooking up quite a storm there!
03/05/2020, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: I had a good worship. And a heavy lunch. And a productive day but the work just seems endless.
03/05/2020, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Is there anything I can pray about for you? I was hoping I'd find some time tomorrow for a call but it's becoming more and more unlikely 😢
03/05/2020, 21:11 - Bee: Don't worry about it...
03/05/2020, 21:15 - Bee: We'll talk whenever you're done with everything 😊
03/05/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: You're up late! All okay?
03/05/2020, 21:32 - Bee: All okay. Bye!
03/05/2020, 21:37 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee. Remember we are loved by God, even before we knew of His existence, even before we could acknowledge it. The only reason I know love is because He loves me :). I'm never too busy to be praying and if I'm praying you're always in there!!
04/05/2020, 08:11 - Bee: Thank you for the reminder, Nischal. :)
04/05/2020, 08:12 - Bee: Thank you. I'm praying for you too :)
04/05/2020, 08:12 - Bee: Especially for strength and knowledge to finish your assignments
04/05/2020, 11:24 - Bee: The chicken pot pie came out delicious!!!
04/05/2020, 11:25 - Bee: Now there should be a rainy day to go along with it
04/05/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's bright and sunny here so if the rains are anywhere it must be there
04/05/2020, 11:39 - Bee: It's bright and sunny here too. My dreams of rains are gonna have to wait for another month
04/05/2020, 20:04 - Bee: We're baking Blondies.
04/05/2020, 20:04 - Bee: It smells so good in here.
04/05/2020, 20:04 - Bee: I hope you're having a productive day, Nischal
04/05/2020, 20:06 - Bee: Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father’s throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
The joys I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word and trust His grace,
I’ll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight.
This robe of flesh I’ll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize,
And shout, while passing through the air,
“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!
04/05/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. ☺️
04/05/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Praying for you often.
06/05/2020, 00:59 - Bee: Nischal
06/05/2020, 01:00 - Nischal Abraham: Hii
06/05/2020, 01:00 - Bee: You're still up?!
06/05/2020, 01:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm still up... I don't want to be :(
06/05/2020, 01:00 - Bee: Assignments?
06/05/2020, 01:01 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
06/05/2020, 01:01 - Bee: Aw :(
06/05/2020, 01:03 - Bee: Is this a research paper?
06/05/2020, 01:03 - Bee: When's your submission?
06/05/2020, 01:04 - Bee: It's okay if you don't reply
06/05/2020, 01:04 - Bee: It will get over soon
06/05/2020, 01:04 - Bee: Remember God's goodness so far
06/05/2020, 01:05 - Nischal Abraham: I have till 12 noon today. It's just a document written in the form of a research paper cause the professor is cruel like that
06/05/2020, 01:05 - Nischal Abraham: The actual work is code stuff
06/05/2020, 01:05 - Bee: Is this the big submission to were talking about?
06/05/2020, 01:05 - Bee: You*
06/05/2020, 01:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yes I know. I'm just praying that my eyelids don't fall heavy at this time
06/05/2020, 01:06 - Bee: Does coffee keep you up?
06/05/2020, 01:06 - Nischal Abraham: There's multiple big submissions now. Everything is a big submission. I don't think I have any small submissions anymore since the lockdown happened
06/05/2020, 01:07 - Nischal Abraham: Not that I know of... I don't like coffee anyway
06/05/2020, 01:07 - Bee: Okay
06/05/2020, 01:07 - Bee: :(((((
06/05/2020, 01:07 - Bee: I'll pray too.
06/05/2020, 01:11 - Bee: God is always faithful in giving his children all they need. He calls us to cast our burdens on Him. All things we always know but it never hurts to hear again.
06/05/2020, 01:11 - Bee: Bye
06/05/2020, 01:23 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee :). I'll hear it a thousand times over and still won't know it enough to not hear it again. I hope you have a good day too!
06/05/2020, 09:14 - Bee: Hey. Been praying for you continuously. It'll all be over soon. Don't reply. Bye.
06/05/2020, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: !!!
06/05/2020, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. God's been good. Submitted my assignment today. Have a presentation on it tomorrow
06/05/2020, 12:49 - Bee: NISCHAL!!! Praise God!!! I will play a song on the ukulele to celebrate. Just one. Two after your presentation tomorrow. Continuing to pray nana
06/05/2020, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: You took your ukulele with you?
06/05/2020, 15:54 - Bee: No. I'm using yours
06/05/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool. Yours is probably better
06/05/2020, 18:07 - Bee: I find the strings in this one thicker which makes it easier to play. I don't know if the thickness varies but this does seem thicker
06/05/2020, 19:20 - Bee: 9. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
2 Cor 12:9-10
06/05/2020, 19:20 - Bee: You may be preparing for the presentation
06/05/2020, 19:20 - Bee: God's got you. I'm praying for you.
06/05/2020, 19:20 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
06/05/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Amen 😁
06/05/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. It is on prayers and weakness I move forward. Sounds like the weirdest statement to make and yet I can't deny it's the truest one I've made
07/05/2020, 10:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/05/2020, 10:55 - Bee: What time is your presentation?
07/05/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Just finished with it! I'm just glad its over
07/05/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: It went quite well if you ask me
07/05/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣
07/05/2020, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: Now I've got a huge submission for tomorrow which again.... I highly doubt I'll finish on time
07/05/2020, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: But every day had been miracles so far so praying I just do this work justice
07/05/2020, 11:03 - Bee: The first thing that came to my mind was 'with _that_ attitude you won't' but I don't know if you're being realistic or what.
07/05/2020, 11:04 - Bee: Our God is a God of miracles. I'm praying for one.
07/05/2020, 11:04 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/05/2020, 11:05 - Nischal Abraham: Byee 😊
07/05/2020, 11:05 - Nischal Abraham: I hope your day goes well!
07/05/2020, 11:06 - Bee: Thank you nana ☺️☺️☺️
08/05/2020, 16:46 - Bee: Nischal!!!! 
I don't know if your submission is over. But I'm praying for you. God isn't bound by time or space.
We made cookies, apple pie, and whole wheat buns today 😃
Also, there's a kids special family hour this Sunday and Reenee and I are doing an action song video thing. So a few have sent videos doing an action song and they're so adorable 😭 I want to bear hug each one of them!
Hope you're eating alright. 
Just a quote I read and liked : 
"Christ died for you individually just as much as you'd been the only man in the world"      - C. S. Lewis
Nischal don't reply okay. 
Bye. ☺️
09/05/2020, 20:50 - Bee: Hey!!!
We didn't make anything today. 
I was busy with the Kids hour thing tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it ☺️
Reenee and I were trying to figure out how to compile all the action song videos. So I was watching them almost the whole day today and it put me in such a good mood! Kids make me happy. Did I mention I'm looking forward to the kids' thing tomorrow? Because I am.
I haven't been studying lately. But I should. I know I should. I'll let you know if anything changes.
There was a bee in Nidhi's room today. And uncle was trying to kill it. It was hilarious. I recorded a video 😛 for memory's sake.
I've been feeling a little low lately. 
It is Mothers' day tomorrow.
I've been exercising regularly. Nidhi got me to do strength training again. But I do it over video call with Reenee now. Because Nidhi and Manjiri are on another level. 
Are you a Fisher of men? Because you just reeled me in 😉
Nischal, don't reply.
Bye!
09/05/2020, 23:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yu keep saying don't reply but what if I want to 🙁. 
It won't be as long and amazing as yours. But I'm glad to hear about your day! Sounds like a lots happening to be excited about! 
My Bible study was good too. Such a blessing of a time like always. I pray your worship and family hour is wonderful tomorrow
09/05/2020, 23:34 - Nischal Abraham: If you're coming up with these pick up lines, colour me impressed!
10/05/2020, 08:02 - Bee: Babies 🥺😍❤️
10/05/2020, 08:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/05/2020, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Aww they so cuute! 🥺
10/05/2020, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: This is pretty high production btw! Awesome work on the editing!!!
10/05/2020, 22:31 - Bee: Hey! :)
The video thing was easy. There's in application in the laptop itself. I didn't have to download anything
No, I didn't come up with the pick up lines. All from Pinterest. But you should still be impressed.
Today was a quiet day.
Oh. Vijay Anna asked Reenee and I to make a video for the nurses at Bethany. He asked us two-ish weeks ago. We finally got around to do it. That's why I'm still up. 
Today was rest day for exercise so Reenee and I did Zumba instead. She found a Bipasha Basu aerobics video. It's hilarious. She's a Bollywood actress btw.
I didn't study today either. Let's see about tomorrow. 
Oh I video called the kids today! Spoke to Liza, AAA, Sophia and Makayla. All grown up ya 🥺 They did so well in the family hour. I think Bennu uncle has recorded it. You should watch it when you have the time. Even if it's in July it's okay
Knock! Knock!
Who's there?
Howard
Howard who?
Howard you like a knock knock joke? 🤭
Okay that was bad.
I say don't reply because you must be busy.
Praying for tomorrow's submission.
Bye!
11/05/2020, 07:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/05/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: Who's the kid?
11/05/2020, 13:32 - Bee: Naomi
11/05/2020, 13:36 - Bee: She's from our assembly
11/05/2020, 20:41 - Bee: Hey!
Naomi finally fell asleep. It was quite the task. Each one of us took turns. 'Ammachi' won.
Sleeping at 3 was a terrible idea last night. Still facing the consequences.
Goodnight, Nischal.
12/05/2020, 08:50 - Nischal Abraham: Video editing is a niche skill to have! That's awesome 😊
You've had many eventful days. I'm glad. Thank you for prayers too. Unfortunately I haven't done them justice and I'm delayed on my submissions. Hoping to finish the pending ones by the end of today
12/05/2020, 08:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm guessing Ammachi is my mother 😂. It's incredible there's so many girls in the house. Would've never imagined it a year or two ago
12/05/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: How's the studies going Debby? And your talks with Radhika? I'm trying to be more active on WhatsApp since I just end up backlogging 50 messages which seems waay too much to go through in one sitting
12/05/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Hey!
Studies aren't happening :(
I'm in touch with Radhika... But we haven't discussed anything about the Bible in more than a week. She said she'll ask if she doesn't understand a portion or wants an explanation... And I don't want to push...? Don't know what I'm doing is the right thing or not
12/05/2020, 18:02 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
13/05/2020, 08:47 - Nischal Abraham: I've been better. I've been worse. I know there's people praying for me so it keeps me going!
Are your lectures still ongoing? By that I mean the daily assignments you were doing before
13/05/2020, 18:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/05/2020, 18:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/05/2020, 18:59 - Bee: No lectures. We're supposed to be doing revision now
13/05/2020, 19:01 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/05/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... Are they showing their fav toys? 🥺🥺
13/05/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh that's nice. We had a 3 hour lecture for math today. I nearly fell asleep half an hour in 😂
13/05/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Yes. They also said hi to each other in their stuffed toy voices
13/05/2020, 19:35 - Bee: You still have lectures?!
13/05/2020, 19:35 - Bee: I thought you had only assignments now
13/05/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it was a tutorial lecture since we have a written exam for it next week
13/05/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Aww ☺️
13/05/2020, 20:02 - Bee: Oh
13/05/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Next week when?
13/05/2020, 20:03 - Bee: I'll go to sleep now
13/05/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
13/05/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: Next Saturday morning
13/05/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! 😊. Can't wait to see you on the Zoom call
14/05/2020, 06:14 - Bee: I'm looking forward to seeing you too ☺️
14/05/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Empty nest syndrome
14/05/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: What is?
14/05/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Naomi left
14/05/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Hey. Okay day today.
You look ill. You must be dm suffering from a lack of vitamin Me. Hahaha. Done.
14/05/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal ☺️
14/05/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Ignore the dm okay
14/05/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Okay bye
14/05/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Well I'm sure it was a nice experience having her 😊
14/05/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for every joke Debby. It elicits a chuckle everytime 😁
14/05/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! Hope your day was good today
15/05/2020, 07:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/05/2020, 07:19 - Bee: We must thank Pinterest
15/05/2020, 07:19 - Bee: A chuckle? That's all? I was expecting full blown laughters
15/05/2020, 08:35 - Nischal Abraham: Is that on our way back? I don't even recognise the person 😱. If it wasn't for the backpack
15/05/2020, 08:35 - Nischal Abraham: Well I haven't opened Pinterest in a while so you can thank them for me
15/05/2020, 08:36 - Nischal Abraham: The jokes aren't that good Debby. It's more the too-cheesy-to-not-be-funny kind
15/05/2020, 09:22 - Bee: Who said it is you
15/05/2020, 09:22 - Bee: Done
15/05/2020, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Considering I was the only guy among us 4 and that seems like us boarding a plane
15/05/2020, 09:52 - Bee: You're right they aren't funny. I'll look for funny jokes
15/05/2020, 09:52 - Bee: Maybe it's not from that trip
15/05/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: 😶. Then i have no clue why you'd share a random pic
15/05/2020, 10:22 - Bee: How come such quick replies... What about assignments?
15/05/2020, 10:23 - Bee: Don't be silly Nischal. It's you. Why else would I share it it
15/05/2020, 10:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/05/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: Assignments are difficult to do so I distract myself with WhatsApp instead of YouTube so that I only waste 5 min instead of 30
15/05/2020, 12:21 - Bee: Oh
15/05/2020, 12:21 - Bee: When's your next submission?
15/05/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: One today. One on Monday. Another next Friday
16/05/2020, 16:03 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/05/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Aww!! Did you hear any good stories?
16/05/2020, 18:04 - Bee: She told me the story of David and Goliath. And she can't read yet okay. Still she told me the story verbatim
16/05/2020, 18:05 - Bee: She's hilarious.
16/05/2020, 18:06 - Bee: For the last two days she was saying No to everything Ruth was suggesting... So Ruth started calling her Pharaoh. And then Norah would yell "I no Pharaoh" repeatedly
16/05/2020, 18:06 - Bee: You must see it. So cute
16/05/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
17/05/2020, 15:34 - Bee: Maybe this will be funny
When Naomi was here, I asked her if she wanted pashu palllll. Not pashu paaal. I realized only after everyone started laughing 😂
17/05/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think I understood the joke
17/05/2020, 15:40 - Bee: Teeth in malayalam and milk in Malayalam
17/05/2020, 15:40 - Bee: What yaaaaaa
17/05/2020, 15:41 - Bee: Nischal ya
17/05/2020, 15:41 - Bee: What ya
17/05/2020, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: OH in Malayalam! That makes sense now
17/05/2020, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: But I don't think I'd have understood palll anyway. I find it so hard to read Malayalam in English 😶
17/05/2020, 15:46 - Bee: Okay Nischal
17/05/2020, 15:46 - Bee: I'll stick to unoriginal jokes
17/05/2020, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Noooo. I liked the joke! It was funnyy!
17/05/2020, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
17/05/2020, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: See laughing
17/05/2020, 15:58 - Bee: Thanks. I'm funny.
17/05/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Funnier than I me for sure
17/05/2020, 17:37 - Bee: I'm sure too
17/05/2020, 17:37 - Bee: 😛
17/05/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Jo.
17/05/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Jo.
17/05/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Noo
17/05/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Jk*
17/05/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: See you are funnier 😂
17/05/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Autocorrect is funny Nischal
17/05/2020, 17:52 - Bee: What's up?
17/05/2020, 17:52 - Bee: How are you?
17/05/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Are you eating okay?
17/05/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Long calls and busy days completing assignments. The usual I guess... I miss talking to you
17/05/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Actually doing very well. I'm finding some new things that are really intriguing to me... Don't know if it's a passing phase or a newfound interest. Time will tell... For now I'm just journaling it
17/05/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Eating well too! Surprisingly it's become really hard to find rice in shops recently so I'm finding alternative things to eat that is not bread
17/05/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: How are you Debby?
17/05/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Hi :)
17/05/2020, 18:26 - Bee: How is the assignment completion going? How many assignments to go? Is there a number
17/05/2020, 18:27 - Bee: I miss talking to you!! I'm looking forward to the journal entries if you don't mind sharing them
17/05/2020, 18:28 - Bee: The only reason I'm not asking for a call is because you have assignments... If you have some time to set aside then let me know :). Whenever. No hurry. It's okay if you can't too
17/05/2020, 18:28 - Bee: Oohh. Is it an activity that you're doing? I shall try to guess
17/05/2020, 18:28 - Bee: Oh. What are the alternatives? Noodles?
17/05/2020, 18:28 - Bee: Just veggies?
17/05/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Tortilla wraps and noodles along with veggies. I've found a definitely tasty option of onions and garlic + anything
17/05/2020, 18:39 - Bee: I'm doing great, Nischal. :) I have started studying. It isn't much but it's something. Hoping to get some more done in this week
17/05/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: It's a point of interest in some videos I've stumbled on
17/05/2020, 18:40 - Bee: I am going to guess Nischal
17/05/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Cooking videos?
17/05/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. I'll let you know if and when I'm free. And I really appreciate you being so patient about all of it 😊. I'll be trying to make time for a call sometime this week though
17/05/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Something related to music?
17/05/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing... I'll just let you know if you've got it
17/05/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Nope and nope so far
17/05/2020, 18:43 - Bee: This is hard
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: I don't know why I thought I could guess it right
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Say yes to the dress? :P
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: People trying out weird foods
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: People learning a new skill
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Jolly videos
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Nidhi got me into this and I am hooked
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Bee: It's a channel. Jolly.
17/05/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Haha they are funny
17/05/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: I've seen only 2 or 3 of their vids
17/05/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: None of the above still
17/05/2020, 18:46 - Bee: People transforming their bodies? Like exercising and getting shredded and stuff like that
17/05/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Okay. I don't know when it'll be but I'm looking forward to it
17/05/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Nada
17/05/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Skits? BuzzFeed? Anything medicine related? Psychiatry or stuff like that
17/05/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Gaming videos?
17/05/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's close
17/05/2020, 18:50 - Bee: Science experiments?
17/05/2020, 18:50 - Bee: Psychiatry?
17/05/2020, 18:50 - Bee: But what about it
17/05/2020, 18:51 - Bee: You did mention that you've had an interest in it for a while
17/05/2020, 18:51 - Bee: 🤔
17/05/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: Just YouTube videos about it. There's a psychologist who's working among video game streamers and he has videos with gamers I've watched before
17/05/2020, 19:18 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/05/2020, 19:18 - Bee: To see why they're into video games? Or if it has had any effect on them?
17/05/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Bedtime for me.
17/05/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Thank you for all the replies 😊
17/05/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
17/05/2020, 20:34 - Nischal Abraham: He's a therapist so it's more therapy sessions with them. But it's eye opening to see the human sides of gamers I've watched on a screen
17/05/2020, 20:34 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee 😊
17/05/2020, 20:34 - Nischal Abraham: I'd say you had it. For no context or clue that's a really spot on guess 😁
17/05/2020, 20:35 - Nischal Abraham: I wish I could reply all day. Well I'm thankful for all I can too... Thank you for messaging 😊
18/05/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Bb
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: What thank you and all Nischal
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: What is this
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Why you doing this
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: What ya
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: I baked a cake for my parents today
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: It's their wedding anniversary
18/05/2020, 17:30 - Bee: I wouldn't have if not for Aunty's persistence and uncle's moral support. Yes that. Moral support
18/05/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Parents were deeply touched and emotional
18/05/2020, 17:32 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/05/2020, 17:32 - Bee: What are you grateful for today?
18/05/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Still no idea what this means
18/05/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: I just want to appreciate it. Even if it's known
18/05/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's awesome! Did you go home then?
18/05/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Hills and valleys. Thank God I finished my assignment in time today 😭
18/05/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: ^
18/05/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: I'm grateful for so many things... But on of them is definitely being able to finish my report on time
18/05/2020, 19:44 - Bee: One day
18/05/2020, 19:44 - Bee: No no. Joji uncle dropped it off
18/05/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Oh praise God ☺️🙌🏼
18/05/2020, 19:45 - Bee: ?
18/05/2020, 20:00 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal 😊
18/05/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's cool
18/05/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: I will wait patiently 😊
18/05/2020, 20:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/05/2020, 06:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/05/2020, 06:24 - Bee: Very slow yes. But everything after this is so hard Nischal
19/05/2020, 06:25 - Bee: I can't say it'll be worth it. I think you'll be disappointed 😂
19/05/2020, 06:27 - Bee: Nischal you inspire me
19/05/2020, 06:28 - Bee: Also, that's a lot of work!!
19/05/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: ❤️❤️
19/05/2020, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: I think that sounds amazing! If you can play it slow you can play it fast 😁. It's better to be accurate then speedy
19/05/2020, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to being disappointed then 😂
19/05/2020, 09:31 - Nischal Abraham: Oh don't. I make big plans and very badly follow them. See I'm already lagging on 603 and couldn't complete it yesterday so today morning goes to that
19/05/2020, 11:07 - Bee: Really?
19/05/2020, 11:07 - Bee: I can't change chords quick so the sounds are muted when I do it quick
19/05/2020, 11:08 - Bee: ☺️
19/05/2020, 11:08 - Bee: I'm not talking about the big plans... It's what you've written before and after
19/05/2020, 15:16 - Nischal Abraham: All I see is the need for me to improve my handwriting cause I found it hard to read what I've written myself 😂
19/05/2020, 17:35 - Bee: It's not bad... The residents at MGM are worse...
19/05/2020, 17:35 - Bee: But the Read in the third from last line does look like Reed
19/05/2020, 17:36 - Bee: How's your day going going?
Reply only if you have the time okay
I can wait. Not for a month though (in reference to your WhatsApp status)
Okay bye
19/05/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Just one going.
Bye.
19/05/2020, 20:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/05/2020, 20:30 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. ☺️
19/05/2020, 21:51 - Nischal Abraham: My day was fairly uneventful today. Got a tutorial for maths in the morning tomorrow
19/05/2020, 22:24 - Nischal Abraham: Btw let me know if you're free tomorrow evening for a call. If not that's fine too. But I should be free tomorrow evening for a while
20/05/2020, 04:32 - Bee: Tonight? Sure
20/05/2020, 04:32 - Bee: What time?
20/05/2020, 07:44 - Nischal Abraham: Anytime before your 12am

20/05/2020, 08:02 - Bee: Meant to send to Nidhi
20/05/2020, 08:02 - Bee: My bad
20/05/2020, 08:03 - Bee: It*
20/05/2020, 08:50 - Nischal Abraham: Better than cinnabon! This I'd like to see
20/05/2020, 09:52 - Bee: 😂
20/05/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Any idea what time you'll be calling? I just want to plan around it so I don't end up having dinner right when you're about to call
20/05/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Is my 11 okay?
20/05/2020, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: If it's okay with you it's okay with me 😊
20/05/2020, 14:30 - Bee: Okay then. Looking forward to 11.
20/05/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Nischal
20/05/2020, 17:50 - Bee: The cinnamon rolls are taking longer than expected
20/05/2020, 17:50 - Bee: We started only by 6:30ish
20/05/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Until what time are you free?
20/05/2020, 17:50 - Bee: I'm sorry :(
20/05/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. Just let me know when you're free and I'll let you know if I am too
20/05/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Okay

21/05/2020, 09:24 - Bee: Who is Destiny? Is that another gamer?
21/05/2020, 09:24 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. 😊
21/05/2020, 09:24 - Bee: Have a good day!
21/05/2020, 09:25 - Bee: <Media omitted>

21/05/2020, 11:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yes you do look very comfortable 😊
21/05/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I hope you have a nice day too. I've had an exhaustively productive morning but need to keep going to finish this assignment 😤
21/05/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: I've only heard the one song and that too it was many many years ago. I think it was when I was in 11th or 12th
21/05/2020, 17:46 - Bee: A good angle for you
21/05/2020, 17:46 - Bee: I did have a nice day 😁
21/05/2020, 17:47 - Bee: How's the assignment going? Submission tomorrow?
21/05/2020, 18:11 - Bee: <Media omitted>

21/05/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Still ongoing. Submission is pushed to Sunday but I want to finish it by tomorrow so I can study for Saturday's exam
22/05/2020, 10:14 - Nischal Abraham: Ahhhh I just watched this today. Absolutely amazing!!! 😂😂
22/05/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: I'm a big fan now 😁. Don't forget me when you're big and famous
22/05/2020, 10:27 - Bee: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
22/05/2020, 10:27 - Bee: It was a lot of fun
22/05/2020, 13:04 - Bee: We have quite a few bloopers...we may combine those too

23/05/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Oh okay 😁

23/05/2020, 18:56 - Bee: On NFS
23/05/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: It went by without issues is the most I can describe it as. The outcome will only be known when the results are out

The handstand video
24/05/2020, 17:20 - Bee: I didn't realise my heart was racing until after the guy who came first finished
24/05/2020, 17:20 - Bee: And the guy who came in second.. he was shifting his weight from one hand to another? Like how?! HOW?!?!?!???!
24/05/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: See! Not a boring video of a guy doing a handstand like you thought 😁
24/05/2020, 17:48 - Bee: I did increase the playback speed to 1.25x...

25/05/2020, 07:08 - Bee: Done is better than perfect
25/05/2020, 07:08 - Bee: (that's what I tell myself)
25/05/2020, 07:09 - Bee: What possibilities? What shifted focus of work?
25/05/2020, 11:58 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't say so. I mean if you can perfect it AND get it done then isn't that better?
25/05/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
25/05/2020, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: All CS numbers are modules for my course 😅
25/05/2020, 12:31 - Bee: With time constraints? Never possible with me. I keep trying to perfect it but never get it done... If I have a lot of time at hand, then sure. And is there really a thing as perfect?
25/05/2020, 12:35 - Bee: Yep the previous one had CS numbers too
25/05/2020, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: Redemption is perfect 😂. But for everything else not really... There'll always be more that can be done. How is your day going? Anything new and exciting happening?
25/05/2020, 14:20 - Bee: Yep definitely not for everything
25/05/2020, 14:21 - Bee: My day is going alright. Exercised in the morning.  studied for a bit. Watched a few YouTube videos. Haven't touched Lamentations yet

25/05/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: Exercise is good 😊
25/05/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: Why what happened?
25/05/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: Do you miss her for the gifts or for her presence?
25/05/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure your still talking to your folks back home though right?
25/05/2020, 16:54 - Bee: The texture wasn't like cake. Kinda gooey. I made it with too many expectations because of was craving sweet
25/05/2020, 16:54 - Bee: Her presence and tight hugs
25/05/2020, 16:56 - Bee: I am... They're so cute. They cast the phone to the TV while we video call because everyone wants to see 🥺
25/05/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's so sweet! My parents don't do anything of the sort

26/05/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Oh. I thought maybe we won't get to talk this week. And then I kept telling myself that it's not like we haven't gone weeks without talking right? It didn't work
26/05/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Debby if you want to talk just ask 😊. And if I'm too busy I'll let you know. But this week is under control. Not very stressed anymore
26/05/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Okay Nischal. I'll remember that.
26/05/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Are your free for a minute rn? I just want to say goodnight

29/05/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's been a productive day for the most part
29/05/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: I was looking forward to the Bible study too 😕. But I'm glad I still have another one to still look forward to 😊

31/05/2020, 21:58 - Bee: Nischal
31/05/2020, 21:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. What's up?
31/05/2020, 21:59 - Bee: I have a presentation tomorrow. I prepared a bit today and will do the rest tomorrow morning. I'm supposed to be sleeping but I'm finding it hard to fall asleep. I don't know why. I'm overthinking I guess
31/05/2020, 21:59 - Bee: Please pray for me
31/05/2020, 21:59 - Bee: I going to try to fall alseep
31/05/2020, 21:59 - Bee: Bye
31/05/2020, 22:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying Debby. I hope you sleep well 🙂. And if you can't and want to talk about it I'm here for you
31/05/2020, 22:10 - Nischal Abraham: I hope when you read this is after well rested sleep. Prayed and praying for your presentation tomorrow and for sleep tonight. 

I tell you this not to put your assurance in me praying but on God who gives both rest and wisdom.

"Commit your way to the LORD, trust also in Him, and He shall bring to pass."
"Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him;"
Psalm 37: 5,7
31/05/2020, 22:10 - Bee: I don't think I'm going to fall asleep anytime soon. I'll work on my presentation and finish it off
31/05/2020, 22:11 - Bee: Oh no did I ruin it
31/05/2020, 22:11 - Bee: I'm sorry
31/05/2020, 22:11 - Bee: Thank you for the verse and for praying
31/05/2020, 22:11 - Nischal Abraham: There's no ruining hope 😁
31/05/2020, 22:11 - Bee: What time are you going to sleep?
31/05/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Praying for this too then
31/05/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: Not for another 2 hours. My bed time's been quite late due to assignments
31/05/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: It'll take a while to go back to normal
31/05/2020, 22:13 - Bee: Oh. Do you have anything planned? To do before you go to sleep
31/05/2020, 22:13 - Nischal Abraham: Just one thing now
31/05/2020, 22:14 - Bee: Oh. Can I call you for a bit in an hour? Only if your one thing doesn't take two hours
31/05/2020, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: . Don't hesitate to
31/05/2020, 22:15 - Nischal Abraham: My one thing is this
31/05/2020, 22:15 - Bee: Oh. Can I?
31/05/2020, 22:15 - Bee: I'll work for an hour
31/05/2020, 22:16 - Nischal Abraham: I just said you can :)
31/05/2020, 22:16 - Bee: Okay. Bye
31/05/2020, 22:16 - Nischal Abraham: 🙏🏻
31/05/2020, 23:18 - Bee: In 2 minutes

31/05/2020, 23:23 - Bee: I'll call?
31/05/2020, 23:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
01/06/2020, 08:41 - Bee: I hope when you read this is after well rested sleep :P

Are you a premature ventricular contraction? Because you make my heart skip a beat 😉

I woke up at 8 and I've been fresh and awake since. My presentation went well. :) To work for an hour last night was a wise decision. 
Thank you for praying. :)
01/06/2020, 09:02 - Bee: It's a perfect overcast day, Nischal. Yesterday was sunny. Today isn't (overcast is my favorite. Second to rains). Almost like God is telling me that He's got me.
01/06/2020, 09:35 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God! 😊. I'm glad to hear your presentation went well. And that you managed to sleep! Hope you get some more rest in the afternoon and don't have too busy a day
01/06/2020, 09:35 - Nischal Abraham: Overcast days are my favourite! Second to none 😂
01/06/2020, 09:35 - Bee: Yes I'm going to sleep now
01/06/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Will wake up around 5ish
01/06/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: There's a message later today right?
01/06/2020, 09:37 - Bee: Yes. 7:30
01/06/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I'll try and join in for that. Sleep well Debs!
01/06/2020, 09:38 - Bee: Okay. See you. Bye!
01/06/2020, 17:56 - Bee: Hi
01/06/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How was afternoon nap?
01/06/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Alright. I woke up refreshed but I'm all groggy again now. I'll go to sleep in a bit
01/06/2020, 18:13 - Bee: How's your day going?
01/06/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Uneventful as expected. Just attended the meeting and now planning on eating dinner
01/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: What's for dinner?
01/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Don't say oats pls
01/06/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Then I remembered I was supposed to call Ruth but it's gotten quite late already
01/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Oh
01/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: This may be a good time for Ruth though
01/06/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: I guess... Sent her a message but haven't gotten a reply yet
01/06/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe I should just go have dinner first
01/06/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: And no it's not oats it's noodles
01/06/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Cool
01/06/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Instant noodles?
01/06/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Are there other kinds? 😮
01/06/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm not making noodles from scratch if that's what you're asking
01/06/2020, 18:24 - Bee: Yes where you boil them and set the aside. And cook up a sauce with soy and stuff and add veggies and then add the boiled noodles
01/06/2020, 18:24 - Bee: No no no noodles from scratch?!
01/06/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Nidhi and I made these for yesterday's lunch. Uncle made his special chicken curry. The chinese kind
01/06/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. Yea I guess the noodles are more the second kind you described then. I'll be adding veggies in myself

02/06/2020, 04:58 - Bee: MY FAVORITE
02/06/2020, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope you had a good night's rest. The rest of the call just ended up being Ruth trying to fill up 8 spots till Ben had to leave and then everyone left
02/06/2020, 09:06 - Nischal Abraham: So you didn't miss out on anything. I think you made the smarter decision either way
02/06/2020, 09:29 - Bee: Just got the marks for this one. Again, I didn't expect it
02/06/2020, 09:29 - Bee: I didn't type it twice
02/06/2020, 09:29 - Bee: I don't know how it got sent twice
02/06/2020, 09:29 - Bee: Haha did she manage to find 8?
02/06/2020, 09:30 - Bee: Yes. I had a good night's rest

02/06/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so happy for you!
02/06/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: On and off yes... Most of the people on were busy working and I felt so bad they had to be dragged into a pointless call 😶
02/06/2020, 14:13 - Bee: Ahh
02/06/2020, 14:13 - Bee: Did you talk about journals at least?!
02/06/2020, 14:14 - Bee: It is raining
02/06/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Not drizzling. Raining

Tried my hardest not to sleep but failed and slept around 5:45 for 45 minutes. Had the prayer meeting. And not will have dinner. The weather has put me in a gooood mood
02/06/2020, 17:31 - Bee: How's your day going?

06/06/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Bye
06/06/2020, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: It was nice walking in this temperature. I'm so out of shape though. Need to start exercising again
06/06/2020, 13:20 - Bee: Oh. I haven't exercised today. I should. The weather is already making her lethargic
06/06/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... The weather be like that sometimes. I really like this weather but it does make for a very non-productive day 😅
06/06/2020, 13:33 - Bee: Me* 🤦🏻‍♀️

06/06/2020, 13:33 - Nischal Abraham: The weather is making you talk in third person 😂
06/06/2020, 13:34 - Bee: 😂
06/06/2020, 13:34 - Bee: I had just woken up
06/06/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
06/06/2020, 16:08 - Bee: We were supposed to make nachos today
06/06/2020, 16:08 - Bee: I don't know what the plan is
06/06/2020, 16:08 - Bee: I'll ask Nidhi
06/06/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Forgot to take the mince out of the freezer. Nachos for tomorrow's dinner then
06/06/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Tonight is leftover noodles from a week ago
06/06/2020, 16:11 - Bee: What's up?
06/06/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Planning out a call with Nikhil. It's been long overdue :P
06/06/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Oh. I hope you're 13 minutes into the call rn
06/06/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: No 😶. I replied but he hasn't replied to my reply
06/06/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Oh

06/06/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Been a while since I spoke to him (from Nidhis phone, as Nidhi ofc)
06/06/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Haha he's doing well. We just talked about random stuff really. Hopefully we can talk again next week
06/06/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Oh that's good
06/06/2020, 19:19 - Bee: We're gonna have a photo sesh tomorrow 😂
06/06/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Random photo sesh?
06/06/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Yes :D we're dressing up. By dressing up I mean wearing clothes outside the lockdown wardrobe
06/06/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's nice! I think it's a good excuse to get dressed up
06/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Yes it is
06/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: It's been a while
06/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have clothes to dress up?
06/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Nope. I'm borrowing a kurta from Nidhi
06/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: I came with 1 kurta for one Sunday because I thought I'd be here for a week. Been wearing that kurta for every Sunday since 😂
06/06/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. No one notices on video calls so that's good 😂
06/06/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: How come you're still awake?
06/06/2020, 19:46 - Bee: Was doing Nidhi's hair
06/06/2020, 19:46 - Bee: I'll sleep in a bit
06/06/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Be in the moment then Debby! I hope you have a fun day tomorrow 😊
06/06/2020, 19:48 - Bee: We finished 😊
06/06/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Your hair too?
06/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: No I'll do mine tomorrow. I will exercise in the morning and take a shower and then do it
06/06/2020, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. It's been such a chilly day today Debby. I really enjoyed it ☺️
06/06/2020, 20:00 - Bee: I'm happy that you did 😊
06/06/2020, 20:00 - Bee: What was for lunch?
06/06/2020, 20:00 - Bee: What's for dinner?
06/06/2020, 20:00 - Bee: Did you get all the stuff you needed?
06/06/2020, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: I did get a lot of stuff. I had pasta for lunch... Haven't decided dinner yet, got some sausages so I'll probably make something with that
06/06/2020, 20:13 - Bee: You made pasta?! Was it the instant pasta?
06/06/2020, 20:15 - Bee: You can make a sausage potato thing
06/06/2020, 20:15 - Bee: And have it with bread or your tortilla wraps
06/06/2020, 20:15 - Bee: Its easy
06/06/2020, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: What potato thing? Like mashed?
06/06/2020, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: It was packet pasta 😋
06/06/2020, 20:16 - Bee: No wait there was a recipe I followed. I'm looking for it
06/06/2020, 20:16 - Bee: It is easy and quick
06/06/2020, 20:18 - Nischal Abraham: Well no rush. I can make it tomorrow night if you don't find it
06/06/2020, 20:25 - Bee: Take a skillet/pan
Add 1 tbsp oil
Add 3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped once oil is hot enough
Once they start to brown, add  1 potato, finely diced
After potatoes are a golden brown, add 1 onion, sliced
1 or half green chilli, finely chopped (or however you want)
Then the masalas. Turmeric, chilli powder, the other spices that you have. And salt.
Cook until onions are nice and soft
Then add chopped sausages
Cover until sausages are cooked
06/06/2020, 20:25 - Bee: Can't find the recipe. This is what I did
06/06/2020, 20:25 - Bee: In the beginning of lockdown
06/06/2020, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby thank you 🥺
06/06/2020, 20:26 - Bee: :))))
06/06/2020, 20:27 - Bee: Masalas you can add 'swaad anusar' :P
06/06/2020, 20:27 - Bee: I don't remember the measurements
06/06/2020, 20:27 - Nischal Abraham: Shouldn't you be sleeping? How are you going to manage exercise and worship tomorrow? 😮
06/06/2020, 20:27 - Bee: ...
06/06/2020, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: Even if you told me I wouldn't follow them. I just put in some and hope it turns out okay 😂
06/06/2020, 20:28 - Bee: I've been told that's the secret of Indian cooking
06/06/2020, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: The general thing I've noticed is 1:3 on the turmeric to chilli
06/06/2020, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: So it's always very little turmeric
06/06/2020, 20:31 - Bee: Oh that's an easy way to remember
06/06/2020, 20:31 - Bee: I'll try to go to sleep Nischal
06/06/2020, 20:32 - Bee: Exercise at 7 for 30 minutes. Worship at 9
06/06/2020, 20:32 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))))))))))
06/06/2020, 20:33 - Bee: You are special and loved

07/06/2020, 09:43 - Bee: Hey :) the photoshoot was a low-key thing because Nidhi has lectures. I couldn't do my hair. We can do it again next week so it's cool
07/06/2020, 09:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/06/2020, 09:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>

07/06/2020, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: How much more were you planning on doing your hair?
07/06/2020, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: The pictures are lovely! Did you timer the last one or was it a selfie?
07/06/2020, 09:48 - Bee: But I did not do my hair
07/06/2020, 09:48 - Bee: Timer :D
07/06/2020, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: Nice ☺️. So what's special for today? Studying for tomorrow's exam?

07/06/2020, 12:46 - Bee: Oh! The longest goodbye
07/06/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: I fell asleep right after sending that 😂. Wow sleeping in the afternoon wasn't as weird as it usually is
07/06/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: It's plenty cold today
07/06/2020, 15:50 - Bee: Brb

07/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Did you sleep through lunch??
07/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: What's up?
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Are you enjoying the cold?
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Hi Nischal
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: It feels like it's been a long time
07/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: We made nachos today
07/06/2020, 19:44 - Bee: The cheese sauce was a little too think but other than it it was gooood
07/06/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Nachos sound good. Busy evening's also sounds good 😊
07/06/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: I ate at 3:30ish

07/06/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: I've been wearing my sweater indoors
07/06/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Ciba made mutton curry so I had that

07/06/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Ooohh 😋
07/06/2020, 19:45 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
07/06/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: I worked on it some after lunch. Don't really feel like doing any more tonight. I won't be doing any big tasks
07/06/2020, 19:46 - Bee: Oh
07/06/2020, 19:46 - Bee: What are your plans for the rest of the evening?
07/06/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: No plans at all
07/06/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'll need to fold up my dry clothes. That's about it 😂
07/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Cool cool cool
07/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Can I call to say goodnight
07/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Or hi
07/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Short call
07/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: If you're not occupied
07/06/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Otherwise it's okay
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Bee: Another day
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yes
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Bee: Yes whatttt
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Bee: Yes
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yes whatttt
07/06/2020, 19:50 - Bee: 🗡️
07/06/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Thank you for the call. Even though it was too short.
07/06/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Bye. ☺️
07/06/2020, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for the dagger. At least it wasn't a sword
07/06/2020, 20:05 - Bee: It isn't? Next time
07/06/2020, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! 😊
08/06/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Hi Nischal
08/06/2020, 08:52 - Bee: :)
08/06/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Today's was alright. So so.
08/06/2020, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm glad it wasn't bad 😊. Last one tomorrow!
08/06/2020, 10:40 - Bee: Yes!!! And then assignments. And prep for finals
08/06/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: And then you'll be done!!
08/06/2020, 10:55 - Bee: Finals. And then I'll be looking for a job
08/06/2020, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: And then you'll be done!!!
08/06/2020, 11:30 - Bee: Then I'll be working for the rest of my life. And get some more studying done
08/06/2020, 11:34 - Bee: But
There's going to be so many monsoons and soft rain and time spent with kids (my own too) and sad days which will make me appreciate the not-sad ones and breakfasts in bed and bungee jumping and quiet times and baking so... Not that bad eh
08/06/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Wow you thought faaaaaar ahead. Hehe I take it one day at a time 😋
08/06/2020, 11:41 - Bee: I have a lot to learn from you then
08/06/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: I have a lot to learn from you! Really learning how to plan things out. It's a very important skill to have
08/06/2020, 12:02 - Bee: That's just one thing Nischal
08/06/2020, 12:02 - Bee: Jk
08/06/2020, 12:02 - Bee: Yes you have a lot to learn 😂
08/06/2020, 12:02 - Bee: Again, jk
08/06/2020, 12:02 - Bee: I'm tempted to take a nap Nischal
08/06/2020, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: Why not nap?
08/06/2020, 12:03 - Bee: Hard to fall asleep on time at night
08/06/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yea... That is a problem. How about do something fun so you don't feel sleepy
08/06/2020, 12:11 - Bee: There's nothing fun to do
08/06/2020, 12:11 - Bee: Here's what I'll do. I'll sleep for an hour.
08/06/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Play ukulele?
08/06/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Watch YT videos?
08/06/2020, 12:14 - Bee: I watched a lot of The office already
08/06/2020, 12:15 - Bee: I did strum for a while. Not in a mood for more :(
08/06/2020, 12:29 - Nischal Abraham: Nap for an hour sounds good too. I couldn't do it myself but if it works for you then go for it!
08/06/2020, 13:43 - Bee: Hi
08/06/2020, 13:43 - Bee: I did it
08/06/2020, 14:33 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: Is that from the bedroom window?
08/06/2020, 15:19 - Bee: Yes
08/06/2020, 16:18 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy!
08/06/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: How's the studies been?
08/06/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Going on. Took a break. Spoke to my parents
08/06/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: How're they doing?
08/06/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: I spoke to my parents too 😋
08/06/2020, 17:57 - Bee: They're doing well :)
08/06/2020, 17:57 - Bee: Oh is it? How're they doing? 😋
08/06/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: They're doing well too. Keeping busy in the kitchen
08/06/2020, 17:58 - Bee: How are you?
08/06/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well... Keeping busy just not in the kitchen
08/06/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Made a lot of calls today... Hopefully will do some exercise
08/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Oh
08/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Have your found the time to try this yet
08/06/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Made it for lunch! It was good!! 😁
08/06/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Ooohh! Really? Did you take a photo?
08/06/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: No... My phone was upstairs. But I'll be making it again. That's a really simple recipe to make 😁
08/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: It is simple 😊
08/06/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: Now I need to buy some greens tomorrow to balance things out
08/06/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Then I need to stick to my exercise time and I'll be back on track with redeeming my time well
08/06/2020, 18:58 - Bee: And you say you have to learn to plan things out
08/06/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: I do! I still haven't done any of the things so it's still a learning
08/06/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Yep. Life is a learning
08/06/2020, 19:33 - Bee: I feel like a philosopher
08/06/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Nischal
08/06/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Bye!
08/06/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Praying for your exam tomorrow
08/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Thank you
09/06/2020, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: Debbbyyy!! How was it?
09/06/2020, 13:40 - Bee: Hi Nischal
09/06/2020, 13:40 - Bee: Today's was alright
09/06/2020, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Thanking God for it all 😊. So what now? How's your week looking?
09/06/2020, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be free for a call today?
09/06/2020, 13:52 - Bee: I have two big submissions on Thursday
09/06/2020, 13:53 - Bee: Yes 😊
09/06/2020, 13:53 - Bee: What time?
09/06/2020, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! I mean if you need to be working on your submissions that's fine too. It can be a short call. Whenever you're free. I don't have any time restrictions today
09/06/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Can I let you know the time by 10?
09/06/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Sure! Take your time 😊
09/06/2020, 14:39 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/06/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure it looks incredibly pretty. The photo's really good too!
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Thanks
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Bee: It is my magic
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Is 11 okay?
09/06/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sure. See you then 😁
09/06/2020, 18:31 - Bee: Hey
09/06/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Could you give me 5 min
09/06/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Sure
09/06/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Cool I'm back
09/06/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Debby?
09/06/2020, 18:40 - Bee: I'll call?
09/06/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
09/06/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Earphone issues
09/06/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Wait I'll call her
09/06/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool cool
09/06/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Messages aren't getting delivered
09/06/2020, 18:45 - Bee: I messaged Sammy
09/06/2020, 18:45 - Bee: He is telling her to turn her internet on
09/06/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool
09/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Messages still aren't getting delivered
09/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Just giving you updates
10/06/2020, 07:58 - Bee: Chillin' in the beach with my best friend Jesus Christ?
10/06/2020, 08:24 - Nischal Abraham: It's just a funny song 😂. I wouldn't sing it for worship at Bethesda if you were planning on suggesting it
10/06/2020, 08:28 - Bee: Goin' out for beers, but not too many beers with Jesus Christ?
10/06/2020, 08:28 - Bee: When you visit you should teach it here with actions and all
10/06/2020, 08:34 - Nischal Abraham: Naw Debby. I'll play the guitar. You can teach the actions... I'm sure Reenee can come up with good ones
10/06/2020, 09:02 - Bee: I'll be excommunicated Nischal
10/06/2020, 09:02 - Bee: You should do it
10/06/2020, 09:03 - Bee: You're visiting, they won't tell you anything
10/06/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: That'll be quite an entrance. So how's the assignments going?
10/06/2020, 11:40 - Bee: I finished one. In the process of submitting it. Another one tomorrow. Rest on Friday 😰
10/06/2020, 11:41 - Bee: The university released a notification saying all internals should be done by 13th. The older notif said 17th
10/06/2020, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: That's going to be hectic! Is there a lot more to be done?
10/06/2020, 16:10 - Bee: Yes it seems like a lot
10/06/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying you manage it all. Hope you've had a lovely day otherwise
10/06/2020, 17:30 - Bee: I wouldn't call it lovely because I just gave Nathan a TT injection
10/06/2020, 17:30 - Bee: But other than that it was a fine day
10/06/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: What's TT?
10/06/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Tetanus toxoid
10/06/2020, 17:49 - Bee: He injured himself with a blade. Tiny cut
10/06/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Is he okay?
10/06/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Yes yes... It'll heal in a couple days
10/06/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. You're getting to practice even in quarantine 😅. How did you get the medicine?
10/06/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Nooo I needed more reassurance than Nathan after the injection. Already asked Linnet Didi twice if he's okay. Pharmacies have it. Ranjit bhaiyya bought it on his way
10/06/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Believe in yourself Debby. You're already near the end of your final year... You must've given a ton of injections already right?
10/06/2020, 18:06 - Bee: I have. But it's different when it's someone you know...
10/06/2020, 18:06 - Bee: I'm not worried that I haven't done it right. I know I have. Just worried if he's in pain or not
10/06/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm yea I guess that's true. Tetanus injections are the worst ones I've experienced
10/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Oh yes they hurt
10/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: What's up Nischal? How are you? What was for lunch? Did you go buy groceries?
10/06/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Made an egg dish and had it with porotta. Didn't go shopping today as it was raining. If the weather's good tomorrow I'll go then
10/06/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: I've been good otherwise. Spent a lot of time on my project today. Spoke to my parents for an hour in the afternoon
10/06/2020, 18:26 - Bee: You're having a good day ☺️
10/06/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: In a sense. I'm saturated after working too much now though 😅. My brains fried out
10/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Oh. What plans for the rest of your evening then?
10/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: I'm going to go to sleep Nischal
10/06/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Watch videos and hopefully read. My goal is to read just 1 chapter so I have a small goal to fulfil
10/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Can you help me with this problem? x + u = 25
x must be 15, because u surely are a 10. Okay done
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Oh. The shadow of the Almighty?
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Praying for your tomorrow 😊
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Goodnight :)
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I almost began solving it in my head and then I read the end and I was like aww
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: I have a lot to do tomorrow
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: What ya 😂
10/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Bye!
10/06/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: What can I say, I like math. I would've enjoyed solving 😂
10/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: 😂
10/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: It'll be a sum next time then
10/06/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Anyway byee! Rest well
10/06/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it 😂
11/06/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Hi Nischal. I was expecting you to message today... Hoping. Even though I didn't. The only reason I'm telling you is because of that conversation we had a few days ago. The one with Ruth... You don't have to say anything. Just wanted to tell you instead of telling it in.
11/06/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Keeping*
11/06/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Noted. Hi Debby 😊. How's your day been?
11/06/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Did you finish the other submission?
11/06/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: How was Bible study? What's the next big submission?
11/06/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: I've kept myself occupied through the day. Worked a while on my project. There's something to do with CUI planned for 7:30pm today so I'll be online for an hour for that
11/06/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Now I feel like you're messaging because you're expected to
11/06/2020, 20:14 - Nischal Abraham: Debby, what's wrong?
11/06/2020, 21:34 - Bee: I just told you...
12/06/2020, 04:22 - Bee: Nischal, I am sorry about last night. I know there's no excuse but I had a rough day yesterday. I'm sorry.
12/06/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay Bee 😊. If you want to talk I'm free when you are.... For the most part
12/06/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Thank you. I wish I had the time to talk
12/06/2020, 11:57 - Nischal Abraham: A lot of submissions to go? I'm praying for you Debby! You'll get through this 😊
12/06/2020, 16:31 - Bee: Two submissions but they're huuuuugggeee
12/06/2020, 16:32 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. :)
12/06/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like they're keeping you busy. When are they due?
12/06/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Tomorrow
12/06/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Cast your burdens on Jesus and He will carry you through. I've prayed and will continue praying that you manage to finish it well in time 😊. Hope you find God's faithfulness through it all. Goodnight Bee! Don't reply
13/06/2020, 00:20 - Bee: Nischal
13/06/2020, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy
13/06/2020, 09:05 - Bee: Hey
13/06/2020, 09:06 - Bee: Just wanted to know if you're up. I knew you wouldn't be. But what's the harm in messaging
13/06/2020, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I tried to go to bed as soon as I was done with Bible study as I had to get up early today
13/06/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: It was a friend's birthday and there was a zoom call scheduled for the morning
13/06/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Oh!!!! Zoom calls for birthdays seem to be the new thing. I was part of one for my little cousin's birthday a few days ago
13/06/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yea! There seems to have been huge plans behind this one as well. Her dad organized the whole thing so it was really sweet 😊
13/06/2020, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: I hope your assignments are going well. I've had a fairly lazy day so far. Hoping I'll be more productive post lunch 😅
13/06/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb
13/06/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Nooooooo messages aren't getting delivered
13/06/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Noooooooooooooooo
13/06/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Nischal noooooooooooooooo
13/06/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Oh wait. Just delivered.
13/06/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Haha.
13/06/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Thank you for praying!!!!
13/06/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Assignments done.
13/06/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Can I call to say goodnight? If you're free
13/06/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Yep you can call when you're free. I am too
13/06/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God 😊
13/06/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Oh noooo was I too late? 😮
13/06/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Too late for what?
13/06/2020, 19:06 - Bee: I'll call?
13/06/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
14/06/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How was worship?
14/06/2020, 12:44 - Bee: Hey :))
14/06/2020, 12:45 - Bee: Worship was wonderful. Every Sunday morning the same thought comes to my mind. Will this be the last time we're worshipping God as an assembly on Earth?
14/06/2020, 12:45 - Bee: How was worship?
14/06/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Worship was good. Sorry for the late reply I went for lunch straight after sending that message
14/06/2020, 16:53 - Bee: What nana
14/06/2020, 16:53 - Bee: Why saying sorry nana
14/06/2020, 16:56 - Bee: What was for lunch?
14/06/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Made non-coconut beans thoran. Beans are deceptively lesser than they appear... I keep thinking I'm cooking a lot of it but it ends up being enough for just 2 meals
14/06/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: What do you have planned for tomorrow?
14/06/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Is it even called thoran if there's no coconut?
14/06/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Oh wait
14/06/2020, 16:57 - Bee: I know why thoran is called thoran and it's not because of the coconut
14/06/2020, 16:58 - Bee: It is something which is kept on the flame for a while until all the water is absorbed
14/06/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh there's a backstory to it? 😮. I've never even thought about it
14/06/2020, 16:58 - Bee: It comes from the word thorth (Malayalam for towel? Don't know how it's spelt) (because towels absorb?)
Both words come from the same word
14/06/2020, 16:58 - Bee: There is
14/06/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I got a few corrections in my assignment which I submitted yesterday. I will work on that tonight and tomorrow morning. No other plans for the day. I want to get back to studying again. I have 1 month
14/06/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yes. Studying... Always a fun task to get to
14/06/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Btw the NFS Bible study is tomorrow right?
14/06/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Yes. Tomorrow night
14/06/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Just confirming... It seems like there's something new happening every day of the week 😅
14/06/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: What was for dinner?
14/06/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Medu vada, sambar, and chutney. It was yum.
14/06/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Sambar is easy to make ya. Aunty taught me today
14/06/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Aww sounds yum 😋. Sambar has so many ingredients though
14/06/2020, 17:35 - Bee: You can add whatever you have
14/06/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Doesn't have to have everything
14/06/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Well is it really sambar if you don't add everything?
14/06/2020, 17:36 - Bee: It's just water, a little Dal, whatever veggies you have, salt, turmeric. Put it in the cooker for 3 whistles
Then for the tadka 
Oil
Mustard
Jeera
Methi seeds
Hing
Kadi patta
Onions
Sambar masala
Chilli powder
Then you add the cooker stuff in the tadka
14/06/2020, 17:36 - Bee: I think I typed it out more for me. So that I remember
14/06/2020, 17:37 - Bee: I want to keep a recipe book Nischal. Which will have all the recipes that I learnt from everybody
And I'll have that book for so many years. It will be all old and worn out
14/06/2020, 17:37 - Bee: And then I'll give it to my favorite child
14/06/2020, 17:37 - Bee: 😂
14/06/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Cool... And if you're saying that's not too many ingredients then I don't know what is 😂
14/06/2020, 17:38 - Bee: But these are ingredients you always have
14/06/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Don't you?
14/06/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Not really? Idk I don't tend to use a lot of them I guess
14/06/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Then again.... I don't cook a whole lot
14/06/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Yeah you don't
14/06/2020, 17:55 - Bee: How will you cool after you're married Nischal
14/06/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Cook* 🤦🏻‍♀️
14/06/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: How does anyone cook?
14/06/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Practice
14/06/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll have to do the same then 😁
14/06/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Okay
14/06/2020, 18:37 - Bee: What's up?
14/06/2020, 18:37 - Bee: How's your day going?
14/06/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: It's been alright. Haven't done a lot in the day
14/06/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Oh
14/06/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Did you watch the whole memorial video?
14/06/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Nischal
14/06/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Bye :)
14/06/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: There's still half an hour of it left
14/06/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Hope you managed to get work done 😊
15/06/2020, 04:03 - Bee: I did.
15/06/2020, 04:03 - Bee: :)
15/06/2020, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy! Good afternoon!!
15/06/2020, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going?
15/06/2020, 13:50 - Bee: Nischal!!!
15/06/2020, 13:50 - Bee: My day is going alright. I didn't do much
15/06/2020, 13:51 - Bee: What's up?
15/06/2020, 13:51 - Bee: How's your day going?
15/06/2020, 13:51 - Bee: How are you?
15/06/2020, 13:52 - Bee: What was for lunch?
15/06/2020, 13:52 - Bee: I remembered that one thing I wanted to talk to you about but had forgotten around 3 phone calls ago
15/06/2020, 13:52 - Bee: I have written it down
15/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you don't have too busy a night do you want to get on a call tonight then?
15/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't had it yet
15/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Trying to work on my project with little to no drive
15/06/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Fairly alright so far. Pretty uneventful as always
15/06/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing great 😊. Still a lot of thinking... But my thoughts seem to be led in a direction
15/06/2020, 15:09 - Bee: Yes!!
15/06/2020, 15:09 - Bee: Share tonight?
15/06/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sure 😊
15/06/2020, 15:10 - Bee: ☺️
15/06/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Nisch
15/06/2020, 17:27 - Bee: What time?
15/06/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: You tell me
15/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: 10:45?
15/06/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's 45 min from now right?
15/06/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Cool yea that works for me 😊
15/06/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Yes
15/06/2020, 18:02 - Bee: 4 minutes from now? Your 6:45
15/06/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Nidhi and I are making Maggi for dinner
15/06/2020, 18:03 - Bee: 45*
15/06/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Nice!
15/06/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's fine
15/06/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Hi
15/06/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Give me 2 minutes
15/06/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
15/06/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Hi
15/06/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/06/2020, 18:48 - Bee: I'll call?
15/06/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
16/06/2020, 08:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 10:00 - Nischal Abraham: This was during the worship meeting? 😂
16/06/2020, 10:46 - Bee: Yes 😂
16/06/2020, 10:46 - Bee: Have a fun day, Nischal!
16/06/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. We had a nice walk along the canal since there's no parks around here
16/06/2020, 14:28 - Bee: Oh. Is that the canal you walk beside when you walk to college?
16/06/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yep the very same
16/06/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Oh
16/06/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Did you get to meet Hannah?
16/06/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: I did!! She has this scooter now that she rides. It's cute ☺️. She calls it her scoot
16/06/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Ooohh!
16/06/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Must have been the cutest sight
16/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Nisch
16/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Goodnight! :)))))
16/06/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'm sorry I've just been caught up with some coding. Didn't even realise the time fly by
17/06/2020, 05:12 - Bee: That's alright
17/06/2020, 06:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/06/2020, 06:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/06/2020, 06:56 - Bee: Haven't read it before
17/06/2020, 06:56 - Bee: Same authors
17/06/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Ah so my mom had the books?
17/06/2020, 10:06 - Bee: Yes
17/06/2020, 13:21 - Bee: The red velvet cake is a flop 😞
17/06/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's okay. You could always try again later... Is it completely ruined or just not red velvet?
17/06/2020, 16:33 - Bee: We didn't have red food coloring. So we followed a recipe which uses beetroots. And now the cake tastes like beetroots. I didn't expect the beetroot taste to be so strong. And we made cream cheese frosting to go with it. But that isn't staying stiff. It is melting at room temperature.
17/06/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Never trying it again Nischal. 😞 I will stick to ready-made ones.
17/06/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Also, the texture is bleh. Too moist
17/06/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Mistakes are stepping stones to do better. Now you know how not to make red velvet cake 😂
17/06/2020, 17:56 - Bee: We're not calling it red velvet anymore. It is Beetroot cake.
17/06/2020, 18:32 - Bee: At least this time it won't be me finishing the sweets
17/06/2020, 20:53 - Nischal Abraham: Does it count as a sweet if it's beetroot cake? I guess it's like banana cake then 😋
18/06/2020, 04:18 - Bee: Sure. Like carrot cake
18/06/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's a much better example!
18/06/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby 😊
18/06/2020, 12:00 - Bee: Good noon, Nischal 😄
18/06/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been?
18/06/2020, 14:40 - Bee: Alright so far. Studied for a couple hours in the morning. Finished reading The Gift of Pain. Spoke to Ben and Ruth. She almost added more people to the call. Ate some cream cheese frosting which I regret now. Didn't get to speak to Norah in the afternoon so called again. Spoke to Norah
18/06/2020, 14:42 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/06/2020, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: You got a lot of stuff done! I just finished lunch... My project work for this week is lagging 😩. So I'll probably have to spend extra time today covering up for tomorrow
18/06/2020, 14:44 - Nischal Abraham: I got up at 9... So a lot of my morning was just working on my project. Got a CU thing in the evening today, and STEP starts tomorrow
18/06/2020, 14:56 - Bee: Brb
18/06/2020, 16:39 - Bee: Hi bb
18/06/2020, 16:39 - Bee: How long is STEP?
18/06/2020, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: Well the format its in now, it'll go on for a week
18/06/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Oh. How many hours a day?
18/06/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Well I think they're releasing videos everyday and there's a discussion on 3 days of the week
18/06/2020, 17:06 - Bee: Oh it's like that.
18/06/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. So it's not like a live video session as such
18/06/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Ahhhh. I thought it would be live
18/06/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: How was the Bible study?
18/06/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Different. The portion was Genesis 20. Abraham and Sarah lying to King Abimelech
18/06/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh interesting. I hope you took notes cause I'll be asking about that when we talk next 😂
18/06/2020, 17:48 - Bee: 😂 yes I did
18/06/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Marginalia
18/06/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nice nice. So what's plans for the rest of the night?
18/06/2020, 18:22 - Bee: I'll call Ruth. Going to pray together for one specific matter... I'll tell you more when we talk
18/06/2020, 18:22 - Bee: What're your plans?
18/06/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Can I call to say hi
18/06/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Less than 2 minimum
18/06/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Minutes*
18/06/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Oh wait you have CU
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Just remembered
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Another day then
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: I can get on a call now
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: The CU thing is in 40 min
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Bee: In a minute?
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Sure
18/06/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're free
18/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Missed video call
18/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: I'll call?
18/06/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
18/06/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Thank you for the call.
18/06/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you too 😊
19/06/2020, 06:39 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/06/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
19/06/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Lovely singing
19/06/2020, 10:03 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/06/2020, 10:03 - Bee: Thanks nana
19/06/2020, 10:03 - Bee: The end is the best
19/06/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: I actually liked the singing
19/06/2020, 15:03 - Bee: Really?
19/06/2020, 15:07 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/06/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: Love the silhouette... Not raining anymore?
19/06/2020, 16:07 - Bee: It rained for a few minutes today. Not too heavy
19/06/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: It's been very cloudy here too. Showered in the morning and I think there's more expected tonight
19/06/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Oh... Did you go grocery shopping then?
19/06/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Just got back
20/06/2020, 14:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/06/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Planes I'm guessing
20/06/2020, 15:00 - Bee: Oh. I always wondered. But wasn't sure
20/06/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: So in a layer above the atmosphere it takes longer for dust particles to dissipate
20/06/2020, 16:29 - Bee: Ohhh
20/06/2020, 16:29 - Bee: I would still like to believe that it's because of a rocket. Always thought it was that as a child 😂
20/06/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Well it could be a jet. Cause they definitely leave that trail behind. Generally domestic planes don't fly that high
20/06/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Oh
20/06/2020, 18:42 - Bee: What's up?
20/06/2020, 18:43 - Bee: How's your day going?
20/06/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good! Very STEP centric so haven't done any work related to my project today. But I got to speak to Rufus so that was nice 😁
20/06/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: How about you? I'm just heading now to go make something for dinner
20/06/2020, 20:48 - Bee: Oh. My day was alright
20/06/2020, 20:48 - Bee: Do you have anything after dinner?
20/06/2020, 21:44 - Nischal Abraham: STEP meeting tonight
20/06/2020, 21:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well group discussion
20/06/2020, 21:45 - Nischal Abraham: But that's done now 😁
20/06/2020, 21:46 - Bee: Oh...I can't sleep. Simply messaged. I'll try going to sleep now. Goodnight!
20/06/2020, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
21/06/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Call tonight?
21/06/2020, 16:21 - Bee: Sure ☺️ what time?
21/06/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be free anytime. Don't have any fixed plans for the evening
21/06/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: What time are you free?
21/06/2020, 16:50 - Bee: 10:45?
21/06/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Okay 👍🏼
21/06/2020, 17:16 - Bee: 👍🏽
21/06/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Nischal
In 20 minutes?
21/06/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: Sure
21/06/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
21/06/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Hey
21/06/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5 min?
21/06/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Sure
21/06/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Cool I'm back
21/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Hi
21/06/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Hi :)
21/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I'll call?
21/06/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
22/06/2020, 09:58 - Bee: Bb
22/06/2020, 09:58 - Bee: Have a great day :)))
22/06/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! Hope you have a good one yourself 😊. Your timing is incredible. I just woke up
22/06/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: The first OK Go video I've seen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTAAsCNK7RA
22/06/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Hi Nischal!!!!!
22/06/2020, 15:09 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/06/2020, 15:09 - Bee: I will watch it
22/06/2020, 15:09 - Bee: You were going to send a screenshot of your zoom Bible study with the lads
22/06/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
22/06/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
22/06/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: I realise now it's a very unflattering image... I think it's one of the initial ones where Hannah joined the call so I got excited and took a screenshot
22/06/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day's been well 😊
22/06/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Awwwww do you have more?
22/06/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Was she not feeling cold in that outfit
22/06/2020, 16:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/06/2020, 16:46 - Bee: She talks so much now Nischal
22/06/2020, 16:46 - Bee: Kids bring so much joy
22/06/2020, 16:46 - Bee: Norah brings so much joy
22/06/2020, 16:47 - Bee: I'll tell you about our conversation when we talk next
22/06/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Byyee
22/06/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Nah that's it. I didn't take any more
22/06/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: It was a warm day
22/06/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: She's so cute ☺️. Much wisdom in this one 😂. Sounds like you've had fun conversations
22/06/2020, 17:01 - Bee: We did. Shes becoming more and more expressive
22/06/2020, 17:01 - Bee: So cute
22/06/2020, 17:02 - Bee: OHHHHHHHH nooooo.
22/06/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Maybe next time? If she joins
22/06/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take one next time if she joins
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Okay
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Thanks
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Thank you Nischal
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Nischal, thank you
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Merci beaucoup
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Arigato
22/06/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Gracias
22/06/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Dhanyavaad
22/06/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Shukriya
22/06/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Nanni
22/06/2020, 18:22 - Bee: Danke
22/06/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Nanni? Which language is that?
22/06/2020, 18:24 - Bee: Malayalam ya
22/06/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I read that wrong then. I pronounced it like the football player
22/06/2020, 18:27 - Bee: I don't know how to write in Malayalam
22/06/2020, 18:27 - Bee: And I don't know the footballer you're talking about
22/06/2020, 18:36 - Bee: No wait I know
22/06/2020, 18:36 - Bee: But isn't that Nani
22/06/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yes it is... I don't know how to read Malayalam either so I wouldn't have understood anyway 😅
22/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: But you're a malayali
22/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: I shouldn't say anything. I can't read konkani
22/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: You must be the square toot of -1 because you can't be real 😉
22/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'm a sad excuse for a malayali 😅
22/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Nooooo
22/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Root*
22/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I like square toot better 😂
22/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: I don't know what square toot is
22/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Hahahha
22/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: The phone didn't even autocorrect. I have lost my trust in the phone
22/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Byyyeeeeeeeeeeee
22/06/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
22/06/2020, 19:43 - Bee: :)
23/06/2020, 12:31 - Bee: I forgot to tell you
23/06/2020, 12:31 - Bee: I made a video of a photos that I could find for father's day
23/06/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Did I tell you
23/06/2020, 12:31 - Bee: A few photos are scandalous
23/06/2020, 12:32 - Bee: And the song is in kannada which you may not understand
23/06/2020, 12:32 - Bee: But here
23/06/2020, 12:32 - Bee: https://drive.google.com/file/d/176RSIgVXpi3OytBeib89ke8nryLOXq-9/view?usp=drivesdk
23/06/2020, 12:32 - Bee: Makes me tear up everytime I watch it
23/06/2020, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: You did tell me. I thought the idea was sweet ☺️
23/06/2020, 13:38 - Bee: Thanks
23/06/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: 🥺. That was beautiful
23/06/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
23/06/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
23/06/2020, 17:40 - Bee: NISCHAL THOSE CHEEKS
23/06/2020, 17:40 - Bee: I WANT TO SQUEEZE
23/06/2020, 17:40 - Bee: What is she saying here?
23/06/2020, 17:40 - Bee: THOSE CHEEEEEEKS
23/06/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: She's counting in Hindi Debby
23/06/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Ohhhhhhhhh watched it again and now I understand
23/06/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. The other one is her responding with her name in Hindi. I was telling Daniel she'll end up teaching them at this rate 😂
23/06/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Is she allowed to watch cartoons?
23/06/2020, 19:28 - Bee: She should learn Hindi action songs!!!!! You could teach her
23/06/2020, 19:30 - Bee: I love the nod
23/06/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: She doesn't like watching cartoons 😂. She prefers nat geo and real life animals
23/06/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Wow golden child
23/06/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: This I could do 😮. I should offer such services to Daniel soon when it's easier to meet him
23/06/2020, 19:32 - Bee: OR you could teach her on a video call
23/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: OR teach her memory verses but that Daniel can do too
23/06/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yea now that I think about it I probably won't be able to teach her a whole song. I can barely keep up a conversation 🤣
24/06/2020, 03:49 - Bee: In Hindi? Or at all?
24/06/2020, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: At all? If I could teach an English song then a Hindi one might be fine too. But it's all in the repetition and that can only be done if Daniel and Dianne learn it too 😂
24/06/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Ahh like that
24/06/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Think about it
24/06/2020, 15:06 - Bee: My friend from school was telling me about how he's working towards a handstand. I challenged him to do it in a month. Today he sent a video of him doing a 3 second handstand. 😶
24/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Bb
24/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: How's your day going going?
24/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Are you eating alright and drinking enough water?
24/06/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Ignore one going
24/06/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Woah... I feel guilty for having stopped trying now
24/06/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been okay. Catching up on STEP sessions
24/06/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I've shifted my dinner time to 6pm now so there's lower chance of missing it because it's too late
24/06/2020, 19:13 - Bee: I was working on the headstand today. Recorded a few attempts to see where I was going wrong. And now I have a bunch of fail videos 😂 all funny.
24/06/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you're okay!
24/06/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Yes yes
24/06/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Falling is the scariest part 😶
24/06/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Naah you get used to it after a while
24/06/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Well I don't know if I will. I was at it for a proper few weeks and I still didn't get used to it 😅
24/06/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been Debby?
24/06/2020, 19:37 - Bee: My day's been okay
24/06/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Seems like you got some studying done 😁
24/06/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Yes I did 😃
24/06/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Goodnight :)
24/06/2020, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
25/06/2020, 19:27 - Bee: I hope you've had an incredible day so far, Nischal.
25/06/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Goodnight :)
25/06/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Also, 10.
25/06/2020, 19:32 - Bee: ☺️
25/06/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Yes I know you're not into celebrating 'months' or whatever... But it is a testament of God's faithfulness and goodness so yeah.
25/06/2020, 20:19 - Nischal Abraham: 10!! I like any opportunity to celebrate God's faithfulness so yes... I think that's a good way of looking at it
25/06/2020, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: It's been a warm day today. I don't know how I'll survive coming back to India Debby 😩. It was 24° and I feel warm
25/06/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: I hope your day was blessed and fulfilling too! Good morning for when you do read this 😊
26/06/2020, 05:56 - Bee: You'll sweat buckets for a fee days and then you'll be fine
26/06/2020, 05:56 - Bee: Few*
26/06/2020, 05:57 - Bee: Good morning :)
26/06/2020, 10:07 - Nischal Abraham: Afternoon! I've got a busy day ahead of me. See you at 10 😁
26/06/2020, 10:16 - Bee: Or 10:45. See you!
26/06/2020, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: Oh is it 10:45?
26/06/2020, 11:17 - Bee: No it's at 10. But ends up getting postponed
26/06/2020, 11:17 - Bee: So maybe
26/06/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: Haha well if it's 10:45 I guess that works out for me. I'm planning on having a veeeery early dinner today
28/06/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby. Hope you're days been good! How are you?
28/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Your*
28/06/2020, 16:18 - Bee: Hey!
28/06/2020, 16:18 - Bee: My days have been good 😊
28/06/2020, 16:18 - Bee: How are you?
28/06/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I'm fine!
28/06/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: I'm good too 😊. I wanted to ask if you'd be free for a call tonight. But if it's late that's fine too
28/06/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Is it okay if we talk later during the week? If you're free
28/06/2020, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. I should be free enough this week. No major plans as such
28/06/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Okay. Thank you 😊
28/06/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Got plans for tomorrow?
28/06/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Not really
28/06/2020, 18:04 - Bee: This message was deleted
28/06/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Did you have a busy day yesterday?
28/06/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: It was the opposite actually... I did a total of 0 things yesterday 😅
28/06/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: How's the studying going?
28/06/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Oh... You could've messaged me at least once Nischal
28/06/2020, 18:12 - Bee: I didn't study yesterday and today
28/06/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Well if I messaged you then I would've done 1 thing
28/06/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Weekend resting... Nice :)
28/06/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Yeah
28/06/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: How was worship?
28/06/2020, 18:32 - Bee: It was good. How was worship there?
28/06/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: It was lovely! Though every passing week makes me wish for worship face to face again... It'll probably be a while longer before that happens though
28/06/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Yes. Unimaginably greater than that will be worshipping in heaven
28/06/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Very true. What time are you planning on going to bed?
28/06/2020, 18:44 - Bee: In about half an hour or so. What's up?
28/06/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Na just keeping track of when the replies will stop coming
28/06/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Oh. Okay
28/06/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Had any moments of overthinking lately?
28/06/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Not overthinking. But the right amount of thinking I guess
28/06/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Or maybe overthinking. I don't know
28/06/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's good right? Sounds like a good thing
28/06/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Yes maybe
28/06/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I'm going to turn the internet off Nischal
28/06/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Goodnight.. for whenever you go to sleep :)
28/06/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay. Goodnight Bee! Hope you get a good night's sleep 😊
28/06/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you always
28/06/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal
29/06/2020, 08:40 - Bee: Hi Nischal. I hope you have a great day today 😊
29/06/2020, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debs. I hope your day is good too!
29/06/2020, 09:37 - Bee: Thank you!
29/06/2020, 12:10 - Bee: Hey
29/06/2020, 12:10 - Bee: How's your day going?
29/06/2020, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: Fairly uneventful morning. Worked on my project a bit... Watched some internet drama videos which put me in a weird mood
29/06/2020, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: But I do want to get some study in for 1 Peter today. Can't wait to see the lads on Friday 😁
29/06/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: How about yours?
29/06/2020, 15:07 - Bee: Ah you didn't have it last Friday
29/06/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Now you can try the 'if I watch happy videos will it make me happy' thing
29/06/2020, 15:10 - Bee: My day's going alright. I think my exams are going to get postponed. I finished a miniseries called Chernobyl. Then watched a light movie. Slept for a bit at 6
29/06/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And we're meeting at Daniels place this week
29/06/2020, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: That's a good idea! I'll try that out 😁
29/06/2020, 15:12 - Bee: OHHHHHH you're gonna meet people! I'm excited for you
29/06/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Was there an announcement for your exams?
29/06/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: I've heard of Chernobyl. How was it?
29/06/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Yes they said that the dates they declared earlier are tentative dates and no students must leave their houses to go to the cities where the centres are (many students have gone back to their native places) 
And PG med exams got postponed to December
29/06/2020, 15:14 - Bee: It's really good. Only 5 episodes. I was hooked
29/06/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. How does that affect your graduation then? Like won't everything end up being delayed?
29/06/2020, 16:09 - Bee: Yes. Delayed. I don't know by how many months
29/06/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: That's a tough situation. How do you feel about it?
29/06/2020, 17:18 - Bee: I feel like I'm in therapy 😂
29/06/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I'm alright. I just want to get it over with but I understand that circumstances won't allow it. What to do now
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: I don't know what to do until then
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: How do I spend my time
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: So much time which I'm not redeeming
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: What to do Nischal
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: What to do???!!!!!
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!!
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's always things that can be done
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!¡
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: It's a question of which of them you want to do right?
29/06/2020, 17:20 - Bee: What things?
29/06/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: I think the problem with these situations is not that we don't have anything to do but rather we have too many to choose importance from
29/06/2020, 17:21 - Bee: I don't know what my options are
29/06/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Ukulele, Books, cooking, learn a language, Bible study, learn a skill
29/06/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Watch YouTube videos, play a game
29/06/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Ukulele, book, cooking, Bible study happening
29/06/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Watch a TV series (+ YouTube videos) happening
29/06/2020, 17:23 - Bee: I want to play Crazy taxi but I can't find the torrent
29/06/2020, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: See you have plenty to keep you going then! What's the problem?
29/06/2020, 17:23 - Bee: I don't want to learn a language
29/06/2020, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't that a mobile game? Won't it be on the play store?
29/06/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Still there's this feeling of void
29/06/2020, 17:23 - Bee: It's a desktop game
29/06/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: I guess I'm not thinking of the same game then
29/06/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: A slight one... It's just a really long vacation isn't it?
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Like a sabbatical, or a hiatus
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Bee: It's not a vacation when you're 'waiting'
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Oh it's a game boy game?
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Are you busy? We can talk later
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Bee: No a desktop game
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Bee: I don't know if it's a Gameboy game
29/06/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I wouldn't be messaging so quickly if I was
29/06/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Okay
29/06/2020, 17:26 - Bee: I guess it's a Gameboy game too
29/06/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Too? So you've played it on the pc before? Cause they're two different things if you're trying to find a torrent
29/06/2020, 17:27 - Bee: I have played it on the PC yes
29/06/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool. I was going to say it's probably easier to have found the game if it was a Gameboy one
29/06/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Oh
29/06/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Can I play the gameboy one on PC?
29/06/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. There's an emulator that should be easily available called VBA
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: It stands for Visual Boy Advance. And then you download the game ROM
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: What's an emulator?
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: What language is this
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: I don't understand
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Maybe this is the language I can learn
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'll have to explain on a phone call then 🤣
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: That complicated M
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: ?*
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Cool
29/06/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well if we have to start at what is an emulator then maybe
29/06/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I'll Google it
29/06/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: That works. Do you know how a Gameboy works?
29/06/2020, 17:33 - Bee: No I don't
29/06/2020, 17:33 - Bee: It's okay
29/06/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I'll not play anything
29/06/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Oh Debby. You can play it. If anything I think the complications will keep you occupied for longer!
29/06/2020, 17:35 - Bee: What is Oh Debby
29/06/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Google Visual Boy Advance... And figure out how to play games on it
29/06/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Okay I'll do that
29/06/2020, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: It's in the same tone of What nana
29/06/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Ahhhh
29/06/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Got it
29/06/2020, 17:38 - Bee: I was miserable that last two days Nischal
29/06/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Which last two days?
29/06/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Saturday and Sunday
29/06/2020, 17:39 - Bee: The*
29/06/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Why?
29/06/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Ignore that question. How are you now?
29/06/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Why ignore it. It's just that I don't know where to start
29/06/2020, 17:45 - Bee: I think I'm okay. It comes and goes
29/06/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's upto you... But I feel like it's more complicated than a single text message could convey. And I always find messages are difficult to interpret... Especially if complex emotion is involved 😶
29/06/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: So I don't want to misread something to mean something it doesn't
29/06/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Also, if you don't want to talk about it right now that's okay too 😊. But if you do, I'm all ears
29/06/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Or in this case eyes
29/06/2020, 17:51 - Bee: What is up to me?
29/06/2020, 17:51 - Bee: I'll tell you on our next call then
29/06/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: This is upto you
29/06/2020, 17:56 - Bee: Okay. Thank yoy
29/06/2020, 17:56 - Bee: You*
29/06/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to it
29/06/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: So what else is new. Other than you having a lot of time and little to do
29/06/2020, 18:34 - Bee: I tried watercolor painting. I now I have one more item to add to my 'why are you even trying' list 😛
29/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: How are you Nischal?
29/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: I didn't ask you
29/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: How have your days been?
29/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Are you eating alright? Any new experiments?
29/06/2020, 18:35 - Bee: I'm sorry I've been aloof
29/06/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds fun! I mean unless you're trying to earn doing it, as long as you feel good that's the only motivation you need
29/06/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: You did ask me. Earlier today
29/06/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well. Having very lazy days and not a lot of new cooking. It's been windy and stormy looking here so haven't found the drive to go outside
29/06/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Yes the process is fun. Result not so much
29/06/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Oh... Eating alright though?
29/06/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Eating very well. I made a lot more rice than I normally do. Then today I made a lot more of potato curry than I normally do. So now I have two leftovers
29/06/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Tomorrow I'll make the third dish and I'll have two sides with my rice!
29/06/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Whoa! That's a complete meal. For an Indian
29/06/2020, 19:09 - Bee: You're gonna gain so much weight 😂
29/06/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Jk ofc you wont
29/06/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'm still not at my weight gaining years yet... It'll happen soon, then I'll actively have to prevent myself from overeating
29/06/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Weight gaining years 🙄
29/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: We'll see when that's gonna happen
29/06/2020, 19:40 - Bee: I'm gonna go to sleep
29/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Bye
29/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: It's the last day of June
29/06/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Bye
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Isn't tomorrow the last day of June?
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: For you yes
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: It's 12:12 here
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay 😂
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your last day of the month!
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: You too
29/06/2020, 19:42 - Bee: And then it's your birthday month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
30/06/2020, 07:48 - Bee: Has she mastered the Indian nod already 😂😍
30/06/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... It must come naturally with the language
30/06/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Yes maybe
30/06/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Good evening! What's up?
30/06/2020, 14:00 - Bee: I'm watching stranger things
30/06/2020, 14:00 - Bee: What's up?
30/06/2020, 14:00 - Bee: My hand has been covered half of my visit the whole time
30/06/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: First time? Which season are you at?
30/06/2020, 14:01 - Bee: First time. Season 1. Just started the last episode
30/06/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Have you seen it?
30/06/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Covering*
30/06/2020, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just about heading to the kitchen for lunch now. I'll be back after you're done with prayer meeting
30/06/2020, 14:01 - Bee: What's for lunch?
30/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I've watched both seasons
30/06/2020, 14:02 - Bee: There's a third season too
30/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: I was wondering if I could figure out how to make potato and carrot mash
30/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: Cause I have a bunch of carrots I need to use up
30/06/2020, 14:02 - Nischal Abraham: And I don't know a lot of carrot dishes 😅
30/06/2020, 14:03 - Bee: I don't know any carrot recipes
30/06/2020, 14:03 - Bee: Either
30/06/2020, 14:03 - Bee: Do you have capsicum?
30/06/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Wait ... I've either seen it or never known about it
30/06/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: If it's recent I probably haven't seen it
30/06/2020, 14:04 - Bee: https://pipingpotcurry.com/aloo-gajar-matar/ ?
30/06/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I wanted to go buy other veggies today or tomorrow since carrots are so unfamiliar
30/06/2020, 14:04 - Bee: You can skip matar and pomegranate powder (I didn't know there was such a thing)
30/06/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: What do you mean by that?
30/06/2020, 14:05 - Bee: Arreeeweeeeeeeeee
30/06/2020, 14:05 - Bee: I meant vision
30/06/2020, 14:05 - Bee: So many typos
30/06/2020, 14:05 - Bee: It's okay
30/06/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! Did you just search for that or did you have it saved already? 😮
30/06/2020, 14:06 - Bee: I searched nana
30/06/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: That was quick!!! Well I'll have to get matar as well then
30/06/2020, 14:06 - Bee: You can skip matar
30/06/2020, 14:07 - Bee: If you're making it today
30/06/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: But capsicum is a nice addition. I should try making the potato capsicum thingy. I like that 😊
30/06/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Yes I like the potato capsicum combination
30/06/2020, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh I guess I'll try out the stir fry instead of the mash for lunch. I'll have the mash for dinner with bread then
30/06/2020, 14:11 - Bee: Okay. Let me know how it turns out
30/06/2020, 14:11 - Bee: :)
30/06/2020, 14:11 - Bee: Send a photo!
30/06/2020, 14:11 - Bee: If you're carrying you're phone with you
30/06/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Will do... I'll send a photo of the abysmal looking sad food I make 😂
30/06/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Naahh the stir fry will be fine. Mash? Yes abysmal looking sad food
30/06/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
30/06/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
30/06/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
30/06/2020, 16:10 - Bee: Looks good!
30/06/2020, 16:10 - Bee: How does it taste?
30/06/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Are there two dishes
30/06/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: It tasted good! Could be better
30/06/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Two potato dishes there
30/06/2020, 16:45 - Bee: What luxury
30/06/2020, 16:45 - Bee: We're having simple Pani Puri here
30/06/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: Simple!? 😂. Pani Puri is complex as it is
30/06/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: The Pani is complex as it is
30/06/2020, 17:01 - Bee: It's easy Nischal
30/06/2020, 17:01 - Bee: I just made it
30/06/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: You are a very skilled individual Debby. It's especially because you made it that it's complex
30/06/2020, 18:29 - Bee: You are very kind Nischal
30/06/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's very kind of you to say 😊
30/06/2020, 19:11 - Bee: That's very sweet of you to say 😊
30/06/2020, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Was Pani Puri for dinner?
30/06/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Yes it was
30/06/2020, 19:12 - Bee: 🤤
30/06/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Bye nana

01/07/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: You seem excited this morning/afternoon
01/07/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: That is the month. You are correct in your statement
01/07/2020, 11:21 - Bee: No I was just remembering you
01/07/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. That's so sweet! I hope you are having an exciting day regardless
01/07/2020, 11:34 - Bee: 😊
01/07/2020, 11:34 - Bee: You too, Nischal
01/07/2020, 20:05 - Bee: Bye
01/07/2020, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: Bye?
02/07/2020, 04:34 - Bee: 😴
02/07/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Now? I guess an afternoon nap sounds nice. How's the weather?
02/07/2020, 10:05 - Bee: Because I was going to sleep
02/07/2020, 10:05 - Bee: Last night
02/07/2020, 10:05 - Bee: Why no Bible study tomorrow?
02/07/2020, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: There is Bible study tomorrow... I'll be heading over to Daniel's place before so I won't be free at our usual time
02/07/2020, 10:16 - Bee: Ahh. I forgot that its at Daniel's place
02/07/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And we're going hiking the morning after!! I'm so excited 😁😁
02/07/2020, 10:19 - Bee: OHH sleepover party!!!
02/07/2020, 10:20 - Bee: Sounds like a lot of fun
02/07/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Probably planning on heading to a McD just for old times sake.
02/07/2020, 10:26 - Bee: Ooh they're open for dine-in?
02/07/2020, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe. Or it could just be take away. I guess we'll see when we get there... Either way is fine cause we could just have the study at Daniels place then
02/07/2020, 10:33 - Bee: Cool. Something special to look forward to
02/07/2020, 10:33 - Bee: The weather is pleasant but weird
02/07/2020, 10:33 - Bee: Sunny one moment, raining the next
02/07/2020, 10:34 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds just like the weather here 😂
02/07/2020, 10:40 - Bee: 😂
02/07/2020, 10:40 - Bee: Will you be free for a call tonight?
02/07/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Ask me again when you're free to call. I'm working on my project rn and 🤞🏻I should be done by afternoon
02/07/2020, 10:46 - Bee: Okay. 😊
02/07/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Hi Nischal

02/07/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Yes
03/07/2020, 06:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
03/07/2020, 06:56 - Bee: Nischal!!! He is Jess Paulraj's husband
03/07/2020, 06:56 - Bee: Jess is the one I told you about
03/07/2020, 06:56 - Bee: I sent a post on Instagram
03/07/2020, 06:56 - Bee: That Jess
03/07/2020, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Yep I remember the Jess you told me about
03/07/2020, 10:36 - Bee: Cool
03/07/2020, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be joining the webinar?
03/07/2020, 11:28 - Bee: Yes I will
03/07/2020, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: Nice... Enjoy your time! I would've loved to join but it doesn't fit well with my schedule 😔
03/07/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Oh. I'll write down stuff. Whenever and whatever I can.
03/07/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. You don't need to just for me but I appreciate it 😊
03/07/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Hey. The meeting was lovely. I didn't take anything down. Was too engrossed. I think the recording will be up on YouTube
03/07/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Have a fun time with the lads! 😊
03/07/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Also, they're moving back to end by the end of this month!!

04/07/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: It was an amazing time!!! Had an absolute enjoyable blast of a time. I'll share it all in detail when we talk next 😁
04/07/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: That's what we were talking about with Lamentations!
04/07/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: The name of the mountain was Tonglagee. They've got funny names 😂
04/07/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Tonelagee*
05/07/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Those trees are beautiful
05/07/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Could be a wallpaper
05/07/2020, 08:51 - Bee: 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
05/07/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Heeeyyyy. Does it mean it didn't rain?
05/07/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Looking forward to it 😊
05/07/2020, 08:52 - Bee: 😂
05/07/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Yes!!!!
05/07/2020, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: The whole place looked beautiful. It's interesting you pointed out the trees cause there were very few of them
05/07/2020, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh it was raining and cloudy. That's why there's a lot of fog in most of the pictures once we were nearing the top
05/07/2020, 09:23 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/07/2020, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you had a wonderful time of worship this morning! Praying your day goes well too
05/07/2020, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm speaking today on a similar topic as well. It seems to be something that God wants me to understand... And the more I study the less I think I actually do 😅
05/07/2020, 09:41 - Bee: Where is the heart-shaped lake? 😂 Did you send this to show how bad the fog was
05/07/2020, 09:42 - Bee: I did. :) Worship was wonderful. Was reminded again about worshipping in heaven. Face to face.
05/07/2020, 09:42 - Bee: Lamentations? Or talking to God about our emotions? Will be praying. Tell me later!
05/07/2020, 12:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. The heart-shaped lake is back there somewhere
05/07/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds lovely!
05/07/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: Talking to God about our emotions. But I thought of it as finding Comfort in different situations. I liked what I shared. It was from the heart which is what I was praying for the whole time
05/07/2020, 15:19 - Bee: I'm sure the assembly benefitted from what you shared since it was Spirit-inspired. ☺️
05/07/2020, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: I pray that they have. I was going through messages in Bethesda and was a bit confused... Did you have family hour today?
05/07/2020, 16:05 - Bee: Yes we had family hour 😁
05/07/2020, 16:05 - Bee: We played two games
05/07/2020, 16:05 - Bee: Also, check out the video that Benu uncle sent
05/07/2020, 16:06 - Bee: Persis made it
05/07/2020, 16:07 - Bee: Benu uncle has done the voiceover
05/07/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep just saw the video! It was really good
05/07/2020, 16:24 - Bee: It's based on the sermon Stephen uncle shared last Sunday
05/07/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Those talented kids I tell you
05/07/2020, 17:30 - Bee: IKR?!?!?!
05/07/2020, 17:50 - Bee: A lot happened today. Not really a lot but it felt like a lot.  Will tell you about it whenever we talk next
05/07/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it 😊. What's plans for tomorrow?
05/07/2020, 18:07 - Bee: No plans yet
05/07/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Do you have any plans?
05/07/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Me neither. Just a meeting with my guide in the morning
05/07/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Oh. How's your project going?
05/07/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Progressing. Slowly but surely... Any more news on your exams?
05/07/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Did I tell you that exams got postponed to 4th August?
05/07/2020, 18:42 - Bee: No news after that
05/07/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Slowly but surely is good
05/07/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. That was the latest I've heard
05/07/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: It is... But there's other things I should get to doing as well
05/07/2020, 19:28 - Bee: When's your final submission date?
05/07/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Like what?
05/07/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: 31st of this month
05/07/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Look for a job for one
05/07/2020, 20:10 - Bee: What's the job application process?
05/07/2020, 20:10 - Bee: I've never applied for a job Nischal
05/07/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Well I technically haven't either. My only one was through campus recruitment 😂. But basically for me I need to get my CV in order and send it out to companies that are looking
05/07/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Then if they're interested I'll get a call back and following that they'll have an interview process
05/07/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: And if I manage to qualify all that I'm in for the job
05/07/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: There's always a first time
05/07/2020, 20:17 - Bee: Can you send out CVs before competing your course?
05/07/2020, 20:17 - Bee: You told me your results are going to come out. I'm sorry I don't remember when they're coming out (I know it's soon). When?
05/07/2020, 20:18 - Bee: Looking at how things are going I think that's going to take some time
05/07/2020, 20:36 - Bee: Goodnight nana. ☺️
05/07/2020, 20:53 - Nischal Abraham: Sure... Companies are always looking for graduates as there's a fixed time for their joining. So even if you get the job they can just assign a later joining date
05/07/2020, 20:54 - Nischal Abraham: I was supposed to get it day before, but they announced that our masters course results will only be out after August
05/07/2020, 20:54 - Nischal Abraham: It'll all happen in God's time
05/07/2020, 20:54 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! I hope you have a great day tomorrow 😁
06/07/2020, 10:00 - Bee: After August?!?! Not in the month of August?!
06/07/2020, 10:00 - Bee: Yes. Perfect time
06/07/2020, 10:00 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal :)
06/07/2020, 10:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh sorry yes it'll be in the month of August. Basically they'll be evaluating the project as well which will only be submitted by the end of this month
06/07/2020, 12:50 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/07/2020, 12:50 - Bee: Oh. After August is tooooo far away
06/07/2020, 12:51 - Bee: Book courtesy (and the recipes) : Shirly aunty
06/07/2020, 12:59 - Bee: God is soooooooooooooooooo good Nischal
06/07/2020, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh did mom give you the book? You'll have so many recipes to add into that!!
06/07/2020, 14:02 - Bee: YES!!! I'm going to fill the book
 Cover to cover
06/07/2020, 14:03 - Bee: <Media omitted>

06/07/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Yep. What time?

07/07/2020, 11:08 - Bee: I'm going to bake an apple pie Nischal
07/07/2020, 11:09 - Bee: All by myself. For the first time
07/07/2020, 11:09 - Bee: I will keep you updated
07/07/2020, 11:09 - Nischal Abraham: All the best! I hope it turns out good 😁
07/07/2020, 11:09 - Bee: I hope so too
07/07/2020, 11:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure it will. And then you'll have another recipe for your book!
07/07/2020, 11:10 - Bee: YES!! Under the desserts section. Obviously
07/07/2020, 11:10 - Bee: I hope you have a great day!
07/07/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! Today is cleaning day so I just got done cleaning the bathroom. Next up is cutting my hair
07/07/2020, 11:12 - Bee: Ooooh

07/07/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
07/07/2020, 11:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 12:05 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 12:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 12:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 13:27 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Some parts required surgery.
07/07/2020, 14:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: That looks absolutely incredible Debby!! 😮. You could sell that in a bakery
07/07/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 16:51 - Bee: Ayyyyyyyyy
07/07/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Is this your after-haircut t-shirt
07/07/2020, 16:52 - Bee: You're getting better at cutting your hair
07/07/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Neat work
07/07/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Or maybe it's the photo
07/07/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: It's always the photo
07/07/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: I realised after I sent the photo that it's the same shirt as last time 😂😂. Purely coincidental
07/07/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: I call it the chopped haircut. It's so uneven I don't think any two strands of hair are the same length
07/07/2020, 17:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/07/2020, 17:32 - Bee: I've been invited for a birthday party
07/07/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Or did you send a photo from your last haircut? 🤔
07/07/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Thank you nana ☺️ I think it tastes absolutely incredible too
07/07/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Did I... I guess we'll never know 😏
07/07/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's so cute! Though I must ask... Who is it? I can't recognise the voice 🙁
07/07/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Christopher
07/07/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Christopher and Eliana call me Bua

07/07/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Yep! I'm a part of the cool crowd.
07/07/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Cool 😎. You have so many names... I struggle to get kids to call me by even one of them 😂
07/07/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Doesn't Norah call you Nischal bhaiyya
07/07/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't spoken to Norah in forever Debby. Maybe when I'm not around
07/07/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Oh. She has called you that when she was on a call with me
07/07/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Aww she remembers me 🥺. I don't call often enough for her not to be shy talking to me
07/07/2020, 18:01 - Bee: She does 😁
07/07/2020, 18:03 - Bee: It'll be fine once you call her. Maybe after they're back in their plave
07/07/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Place*
07/07/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Do you know when they'll be back?
07/07/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Thursday
07/07/2020, 20:23 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you had a good day today. I did stuff I'd put off forever so feeling like today was a productive day 😊
08/07/2020, 09:58 - Bee: Hey
08/07/2020, 09:59 - Bee: I had a great day :)
08/07/2020, 09:59 - Bee: That's good! You worked on your project?
08/07/2020, 09:59 - Bee: Did you vacuum your carpet?
08/07/2020, 09:59 - Bee: I'm back home
08/07/2020, 09:59 - Bee: But it feels like I've left home
08/07/2020, 10:01 - Bee: :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
08/07/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Working on my project today. Haven't vacuumed my carpet yet. I guess that's next up on things I've put off forever
08/07/2020, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't home where the heart is?
08/07/2020, 14:08 - Bee: My heart is in so many places
08/07/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: Then you've got so many homes 😊
08/07/2020, 16:01 - Bee: I guess I do. 😊
08/07/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Did you fall from a vending machine?

08/07/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
08/07/2020, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: What do you mean by snack?
09/07/2020, 07:10 - Bee: Isn't it slang for attractive or something like that?
09/07/2020, 08:47 - Bee: You're not a snack Nischal
09/07/2020, 08:47 - Bee: You're the whole meal
09/07/2020, 08:47 - Bee: You did not fall from a vending machine
09/07/2020, 08:48 - Bee: You fell from a homely kitchen
09/07/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Aww thank you 😊. I like being a meal from the kitchen... I guess
09/07/2020, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have a wonderful day Debby! Hope you're enjoying time since you've been back home
09/07/2020, 11:01 - Bee: I am. Looking forward to my evening walk in the rain 😌

09/07/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: How was the walk?
09/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: Wonderful, Nischal. 🥺
09/07/2020, 16:29 - Bee: My Crocs gave me shoebites by the end but it was worth it
09/07/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't you wear shoes? Or are they not waterproof?
09/07/2020, 18:17 - Bee: They aren't waterproof
09/07/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you feel it's worth it then the shoebite isn't too bad
09/07/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Yep not too bad
09/07/2020, 19:16 - Bee: How's your day going?
09/07/2020, 19:16 - Bee: How are you?
09/07/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Let me know whenever
09/07/2020, 19:18 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)))))
09/07/2020, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been busy. I'm terribly tired. Need to go shopping tomorrow. It turned into a nice day only in the evening today so I didn't go today. Hopefully the weather stays good
10/07/2020, 08:36 - Bee: Oh :( busy with your project?
10/07/2020, 08:36 - Bee: Praying for you. :)
10/07/2020, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Got a demo with my guide today that I'm not really prepared for 😶. Thank you for praying :)
10/07/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Hey
10/07/2020, 16:57 - Bee: How did it go?
10/07/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: I wasn't fully ready so I told him I'll show it to him next week. So it ended up being a short meeting with a lot of things to finish up by next week
10/07/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Oh. Busy week then
10/07/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Not by yourself ofc. With God's strength ofc.
10/07/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Have a wonderful time of Bible study!
10/07/2020, 18:49 - Bee: My day was alright. I slept quite a lot. I shall correct that tomorrow. Went for a drive with papa in the morning. I drove!! Upto Rabodi. Bought beef. I'm going to cook tomorrow. Spoke to Norah for a while (she kept asking for somebody else to talk to, and that's why called you). There was sisters' meeting and the family meeting after that. Then I exercised with Ashley. That was fun. I'll probably watch something and then go to sleep
10/07/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Bye, Nischal!
10/07/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you've had a busy day too! I didn't even get any notification for a call 😮. Did you call today? Well either way reply whenever you do end up reading this
10/07/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely 😁
11/07/2020, 07:50 - Bee: Yes I called. Norah was on the call too. Around 11:30am my time. I think your internet was off
11/07/2020, 07:51 - Bee: Nischal
11/07/2020, 07:51 - Bee: Can you forward the IELTS material you referred to for your prep
11/07/2020, 07:51 - Bee: Shirly aunty told me to ask yoy
11/07/2020, 07:51 - Bee: You*
11/07/2020, 07:51 - Bee: Instead of wasting my time I can do that
11/07/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yes my internet was probably off. I thought you called in the evening
11/07/2020, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: Sure! I can do that. It's all online stuff but I'll send you all I have
11/07/2020, 10:26 - Nischal Abraham: Basically a bunch of YouTube videos. And I'm not sure since there's a lockdown now, but when I registered for the exam on the official site, they sent me the text book for IELTS as well
11/07/2020, 12:00 - Bee: Okay
11/07/2020, 12:00 - Bee: I'm nervous about the birthday party Nischal
11/07/2020, 12:01 - Bee: I have organized a few games
11/07/2020, 12:04 - Bee: I feel like I'm the boring kid who's been invited to hang out with the cool kids
11/07/2020, 12:04 - Bee: It is in an hour
11/07/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy the party! I'm sure you'll be fine. You're not the boring kid... You'll be the aunty at the party
11/07/2020, 13:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/07/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Nice background 😁
11/07/2020, 14:10 - Bee: 😂
11/07/2020, 14:10 - Bee: It was fun!!!!
11/07/2020, 14:10 - Bee: One game was more for the mums
11/07/2020, 14:28 - Nischal Abraham: You were included in that game? Or literally mums
11/07/2020, 14:32 - Bee: No it was supposed to be kids but the mums were more active
11/07/2020, 14:32 - Bee: I conducted the games. Didn't play any
11/07/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Nischal
11/07/2020, 18:54 - Bee: I hope you've had a great day so far
11/07/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Goodnight (for whenever you go to sleep)
11/07/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been alright 😊. Missed you for the Bible study. Good morning for when you read this!
12/07/2020, 07:00 - Bee: 😁
12/07/2020, 07:34 - Bee: I heard the Bible study was amazing. Will go through the recording
12/07/2020, 07:34 - Bee: Have a wonderful time of worship and a wonderful day :)
12/07/2020, 09:28 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I hope worship was good today. Got any major plans the rest of the day?
12/07/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be going climbing later with Daniel. It's going to be terrible but I'm so excited for it 😁
12/07/2020, 09:35 - Bee: No major plans. No minor plans. No plans at all 😩
12/07/2020, 09:35 - Bee: Ooh! Why terrible?
12/07/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Terrible cause it's been weeks since I've exercised and months since I've climbed 😂
12/07/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: I think I'll be exhausted in half an hour
12/07/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: No plans are good Debby! It'll be a nice relaxing day 😊
12/07/2020, 10:28 - Bee: An sore for the next two days
12/07/2020, 10:28 - Bee: And*
12/07/2020, 10:28 - Bee: All of my days have been relaxing days only
12/07/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Have fun, Nischal!
12/07/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Don't touch your face without washing your hands okay. I know you know it but still.
12/07/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be careful. Thank you for the reminder. There's a lot of precaution put in place so it should be fine for the most part
12/07/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Oh that's good
12/07/2020, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry for delaying sending the IELTS stuff btw. I know I've stored all my links safely somewhere I just need to recall where that is 😅
12/07/2020, 14:20 - Bee: That's okay. I'm in no hurry
13/07/2020, 07:38 - Bee: http://andi-sheba.blogspot.com/2016/08/a-joyous-goodbye-delight-seasoned.html
13/07/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Beautiful. Thanks for sharing that Debby. I always feel challenged when I read about people who lived and continued steadfastly in the call that God laid out for them
13/07/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Yes reading about it was quite enriching. He truly loved his Lord Jesus and loved people
13/07/2020, 10:43 - Bee: Ran his race will. Kept the faith.
13/07/2020, 10:44 - Bee: Challenged is the right word, yes
13/07/2020, 11:04 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.youtube.com/user/ieltsliz

This channel is practically 80% of my prep for IELTS. The little that I did anyway
13/07/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: You may want to increase speed to x1.25 or x1.5 as she speaks quite slowly 😋
13/07/2020, 11:29 - Bee: Noted.
13/07/2020, 11:29 - Bee: I'm go to binge watch. With snacks and all
13/07/2020, 11:30 - Bee: Going*
13/07/2020, 11:30 - Bee: How was rock climbing?
13/07/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Exhausted now... But we did better than I initially thought we would! Stayed over at Daniel's for the night
13/07/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a fun plan
13/07/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Your idea of fun is weird Nischal
13/07/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Oh so you met Hannah?!
13/07/2020, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Snacks and binge watching sounds like a normal idea of fun no?
13/07/2020, 13:02 - Nischal Abraham: I did!! She's so adorable 🥺. She talks so much more now. And everything she says is sing songy
13/07/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Binge watching ielts videos?
13/07/2020, 14:02 - Bee: Awwwww. I think kids aged 2-4 years are the cutest. I don't want them to grow up
13/07/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: Not the worst idea for videos I've heard of 😂
13/07/2020, 16:53 - Bee: I stopped after 40 minutes. Not my kinda stuff for binge watching. For you? Okay
13/07/2020, 18:53 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/07/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Bye
13/07/2020, 18:54 - Bee: *Goodnight
13/07/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't be able to binge watch that either
13/07/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby! I hope you had a good day... Sorry I haven't been replying today
13/07/2020, 21:58 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN91_Kb8Mbc

Here's an indulgence of a song where the lyrics don't need to make any sense for it to evoke emotion. I enjoyed listening to it. I suggest just playing it as background music and not really watch the video. But up to you how you want to listen to it
14/07/2020, 07:23 - Bee: I listened to it sitting by the window looking at the rains outside. It was a wonderful feeling
14/07/2020, 07:23 - Bee: I had an okay day
14/07/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope you have a better day today then 😊
14/07/2020, 10:38 - Bee: How was your day?
14/07/2020, 10:38 - Bee: Any plans for today?
14/07/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yesterday was me feeling sore for the most part. But I exercised in the evening and I feel better now
14/07/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'll go shopping in a while if the weather holds up. Otherwise there's a lot of project work to do. I want to go climbing on Thursday again IF I finish my project work in time so I need to work on it today
14/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: When's your next meeting with your professor?
14/07/2020, 14:38 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/07/2020, 14:38 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/07/2020, 14:38 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/07/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Last year this day
14/07/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: It's on Friday. I have to send in my dissertation draft by Thursday so he has time to go through it
14/07/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Aww 🥺. It's already been a year since then!! I miss them days when we'd just go out for food
14/07/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: Accidental picture of us together... Or is it? 🤔
14/07/2020, 16:15 - Bee: Oh. You have a lot to do then
14/07/2020, 16:15 - Bee: I miss those days too :((( it's gonna take a while for places to open up. And even if they do, I don't know about dining in :(((
14/07/2020, 16:16 - Bee: Accidental! I didn't take these. Reenee did. Maybe not accidental then
14/07/2020, 16:16 - Bee: I've got more 😁
14/07/2020, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Haha Reenee being all sneaky. Yea it would take a while for things to open up. But aren't restaurants open for delivery yet?
14/07/2020, 16:23 - Bee: Some of them yes
14/07/2020, 16:23 - Bee: Fast food joints are open for delivery
14/07/2020, 16:24 - Bee: When will be an okay time for a call? Let me know what day you'll be free
14/07/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free today for a call. Not sure about the next 3 days after
14/07/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Not even tomorrow? Noooooo
14/07/2020, 16:43 - Bee: In an hour and a half then?
14/07/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Your 6:15
14/07/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Tomorrow is the least sure. At least all the other days I have a planned time I'll be busy. Tomorrow is full of uncertainty as to when my phone will be occupied :/
14/07/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me. I hope that's okay with you
14/07/2020, 16:59 - Bee: It is. :)
14/07/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5 min and I'll be free
14/07/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Okay
14/07/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Alright I'm free
14/07/2020, 18:20 - Bee: Can you give me 10 minutes
14/07/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Sure :)
14/07/2020, 18:30 - Bee: Hi
14/07/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
14/07/2020, 18:31 - Bee: I'll call?
14/07/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
14/07/2020, 20:41 - Bee: I sent this to Reenee
14/07/2020, 20:41 - Bee: And she replied
14/07/2020, 20:41 - Bee: Subtly clicking pictures
14/07/2020, 20:41 - Bee: Who can wing it like this woman!😉
14/07/2020, 20:41 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/07/2020, 20:42 - Bee: She is good
14/07/2020, 20:42 - Bee: Bye!
14/07/2020, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! That is impressive 👏
15/07/2020, 06:10 - Bee: https://youtu.be/oAQmRO42UHc
15/07/2020, 06:16 - Bee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BB. 🤗
15/07/2020, 09:36 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
15/07/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: That is the best thing I've seen today!
15/07/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Can't stop grinning 😆
15/07/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you!!!!!
15/07/2020, 09:54 - Bee: Aww. :)
15/07/2020, 09:54 - Bee: But there's more
15/07/2020, 09:55 - Bee: Since you already have too many happy birthday themed messages and calls I'll send the rest tomorrow
15/07/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Haha okay. Keep the momentum going. I will wait for it patiently 😁
15/07/2020, 10:02 - Bee: Is your birthday just another day for you?
15/07/2020, 10:02 - Bee: I wanted to ask you last night but I forgot
15/07/2020, 10:04 - Bee: Or are you big on birthdays?
15/07/2020, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: This sounds more accurate. Didn't we have a whole discussion about birthdays when we were walking through meadows?
15/07/2020, 10:11 - Bee: We did? I don't remember ya 😩
15/07/2020, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: I like the wishes and surprises people do for me. But I'd like them on any day of the year. It's convenient for my birthday to be an excuse for celebration so I'll take it
15/07/2020, 10:12 - Bee: Oh
15/07/2020, 10:12 - Bee: But the birthday song song wouldn't be appropriate for any other day
15/07/2020, 10:12 - Bee: But the other things, sure
15/07/2020, 10:12 - Bee: Sounds like what I feel too.
15/07/2020, 10:13 - Bee: Cool.
15/07/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: The birthday song is the most awkward part 😬. I'd be happy to skip out on that one
15/07/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'd prefer your video over the birthday song
15/07/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: But that video is fire so I don't know why anyone wouldn't want that!
15/07/2020, 11:32 - Bee: Hahahah
15/07/2020, 11:33 - Bee: I tried to do one of me but adding in the Emojis was so difficult
15/07/2020, 11:33 - Bee: Next year
15/07/2020, 11:55 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's okay I liked the video ☺️
15/07/2020, 12:09 - Bee: 🥺😊
15/07/2020, 14:54 - Bee: Bb
15/07/2020, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. What up?
15/07/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Did you like the surprise? Was it even a surprise?
15/07/2020, 15:36 - Bee: We had pani Puri for dinner
15/07/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: It was lovely!!! Thoroughly surprised. I was expecting the Ruth call, but definitely not the zoom call
15/07/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you so much Bee ☺️
15/07/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: I wish I could've joined in the Pani Puri as well
15/07/2020, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sidenote: you seem to have Pani Puri for dinner quite often 🤔
15/07/2020, 15:47 - Bee: I want expecting the Ruth call 😂
15/07/2020, 15:48 - Bee: ☺️
15/07/2020, 15:48 - Bee: One day!
15/07/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Maa's Pani Puri is much better than mine. Not surprised
15/07/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Parents were waiting for me to come home to make it here... They haven't had it since lockdown. But me? Had it thrice already 🤤
15/07/2020, 15:49 - Bee: There's pani Puri everywhere I goq
15/07/2020, 15:50 - Bee: Go*
15/07/2020, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: Are you complaining? It seems like you're enjoying it 😋
15/07/2020, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: Btw what's your opinion on chocolate?
15/07/2020, 15:52 - Bee: Nope not complaining 😛
15/07/2020, 15:53 - Bee: I don't like chocolate ice cream and chocolate cake (if it's just chocolate) if there's cream of another flavor then I may have a small slice.
Chocolate bars - I don't mind a small piece of Dairy milk. One tiny rectangle
15/07/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! So what's plans for the rest of the day?
15/07/2020, 16:01 - Bee: No plans. Dinners done and it's only 8:30. I'll work on the Proverbs course for a bit.
15/07/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Do you have plans?
15/07/2020, 16:02 - Bee: What's your opinion on chocolate?
15/07/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Happy birthday, Nisch. ☺️
15/07/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: I like chocolate for the most part. But like with any other sweet, not too much of it in quantity
15/07/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Work on project so I can go climbing tomorrow
15/07/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby! For everything :)
15/07/2020, 16:08 - Bee: How's that going? Did you get enough time to work today? Or busy with messages and calls
15/07/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Praying that you finish in time if not before time
15/07/2020, 16:08 - Bee: ☺️
15/07/2020, 16:09 - Bee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, NISCHAL! 
Praying Matt 6:33 (But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you) over you and me. 
Your kindness is toad-ally awesome 🐸. And I know it's corny, but you're a-maize-ing 🌽. 😛
Looking forward to seeing how God continues to use you, int his country and the next. 
Happy birthday!! :)
15/07/2020, 16:09 - Bee: This was last year's wish
15/07/2020, 16:09 - Bee: Still praying Matt 6:33
15/07/2020, 16:10 - Bee: These puns are amazing ya. That's why sending it again. Couldn't come yo with better ones.
15/07/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: Those puns are amazing! I remember you sending that to me last year it made my day
15/07/2020, 16:18 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks. I haven't been able to put in as much time as I've wanted to so far. Hopefully the rest of the day is more productive
15/07/2020, 16:24 - Bee: Aww Nischal
15/07/2020, 16:25 - Bee: Yes you have a quite a few hours remaining
15/07/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Many of those hours are just being spent replying to people :(
15/07/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Reply all at once na. Don't reply to my messages. Tomorrow is fine. 😊
15/07/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: What noooo.... Yours are the messages I want to reply back to. But there's all these people I haven't spoken to in so long so then the conversation picks up and with lockdown there's the obvious question of how are things with lockdown
15/07/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Tell them to go read your status 😛
15/07/2020, 18:15 - Bee: If only you didn't have to send in your draft tomorrow
15/07/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: OH! I completely forgot about that status! 🤣. I'd put them up in May when I was bogged down with assignments and forgot to take it off
15/07/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Still applies. 😂
15/07/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: True. But on birthday it's all overlooked
15/07/2020, 18:23 - Bee: This is year 3 of the 'who wishes Nischal happy birthday the maximum number of times'. Am I still winning?
15/07/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Competition
15/07/2020, 18:26 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/07/2020, 18:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/07/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. Not that I'm keeping a count, but you've definitely wished many times this year already
15/07/2020, 18:49 - Bee: Cool. Just asking. It's not like I'm competitive or anything
15/07/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Not like the person you're competing with is competitive 😂
15/07/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Right right. That's good. Because she LOST
15/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Hey.

And I am sure of this, that He who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:6

I thank God for His faithfulness and goodness towards you. Especially in the last one year. Going to a new country and all. 
I don't know why but I'm reminded of the song His mercy is more
"What love could remember no wrongs we have done
Omniscient, all knowing, He counts not their sum
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many, His mercy is more"

I thank God for you, Nischal. All of this still feels like a dream sometimes. More than I could ask or imagine. You're really good to me. I thank God every day and I'm thanking you too. 
Looking forward to all that God has planned. :) 
Happy birthday, Nischal
15/07/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Again, it's okay if you don't reply
15/07/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Goodnight :)
15/07/2020, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to all of God's plans too. For me, for you, for us. Whatever it may be. Thank you for being you 😊. Goodnight!
16/07/2020, 08:52 - Bee: ☺️
16/07/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: Awkward videos of me that Rufus took
16/07/2020, 10:26 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Are these from yesterday? You went out yesterday??
16/07/2020, 10:27 - Bee: No wait. Your hair is longer here. Can't be yesterday
16/07/2020, 10:27 - Bee: So cute ☺️
16/07/2020, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: Na that's from last semester. I haven't met him since lockdown has happened
16/07/2020, 10:28 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Ahh
16/07/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Did you take a screenshot 😂😂. That's so bad
16/07/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Yes I did. And I'm surprised that I took it at the exact same moment as this one
16/07/2020, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: I thought the point of profile pictures was to look good 🤣
16/07/2020, 10:30 - Bee: It's been raining since morning. So pleasant. Been sitting by the window for so long now
16/07/2020, 10:30 - Bee: Oh please. Look at mine 😂
16/07/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: What do you mean!!? Yours is so good!! It's edited up to make y'all look like superheroes
16/07/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lovely day 😊. It's been sunny and cloudy here
16/07/2020, 11:15 - Bee: 😂. Thanks to Reenee. She found this app where there are cool edits. Her Zoom photo is from the same app
16/07/2020, 11:15 - Bee: Sunny and cloudy?
16/07/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Bright and cloudy. Though now it's just bright
16/07/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Oh
16/07/2020, 14:18 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 14:34 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/07/2020, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: Interesting. Looks like the games Nidhi usually plays
16/07/2020, 16:18 - Bee: Papa was impressed with my speed of making sandwiches
16/07/2020, 16:18 - Bee: How's your draft completion going?
16/07/2020, 16:19 - Bee: Praying that you finish and get to go rock climbing
16/07/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: I decided not to go climbing. I finally managed to finish my draft but I have to work on my demo for tomorrow so I thought it best not to go
16/07/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Oh. You finished!!!
16/07/2020, 18:04 - Bee: That's great
16/07/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: I "finished". There's plenty more to do. I'll probably be really busy these next 2 weeks
16/07/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Oh
16/07/2020, 19:27 - Bee: And then you're done!
16/07/2020, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. One day at a time though 😶
17/07/2020, 09:51 - Bee: Roses are red
Violets are blue
You make me feel all tingly 
And I love your smile too
17/07/2020, 09:51 - Bee: One down, 24 to go
17/07/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Sorry I haven't been messaging all day. I've been working on my project
17/07/2020, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: I don't understand
18/07/2020, 12:50 - Bee: It was your 25th birthday on the 15th. I was going to send 25 random thing throughout the day. But then decided to send random stuff on random says
18/07/2020, 12:52 - Bee: .
18/07/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Days*
18/07/2020, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: OHH! I feel so dumb for not realising that 😅
18/07/2020, 13:21 - Bee: 😂
18/07/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Call today?
18/07/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Sure! What time?
18/07/2020, 16:39 - Nischal Abraham: Your 10:30 or 11ish? Is that too late?
18/07/2020, 16:44 - Bee: No not too late. But I'm not sure about 10:30...10:45ish?
18/07/2020, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yea anytime after 10:30 is good for me. Just let me know whenever you're free
18/07/2020, 17:00 - Bee: Okay
18/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Give me a few more minutes
18/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Please
18/07/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time
18/07/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Hi
18/07/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Hey :)
18/07/2020, 19:37 - Bee: I'll call?
18/07/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
19/07/2020, 10:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/07/2020, 10:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/07/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that mask looks so good! 😮
19/07/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm almost tempted to stitch one for myself now 😂
19/07/2020, 13:08 - Bee: 😂
19/07/2020, 13:08 - Bee: It fits perfectly
19/07/2020, 13:08 - Bee: You should!!! I'll tell you where I went wrong. It will be easier for you
19/07/2020, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: I don't have a spare kurta to cut up
19/07/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Do you have a cotton shirt? Or cotton pants? Shorts or whatever
19/07/2020, 15:48 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/07/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be sorry. They look so yummy 😋
19/07/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay Bee. I'll probably just buy a reusable one. I barely step out of the house as it is
19/07/2020, 18:50 - Bee: We made too many Momos. Ashley, Jason, and I overate. And there's still leftover for tomorrow's breakfast/lunch
19/07/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Okay. The single use ones are too expensive
19/07/2020, 18:52 - Bee: The men in the house weren't so impressed. They declined my offer of stitching them masks. But maa and Ruth have asked me for one. I'll stitch for them. I don't know how to send Ruth hers though
19/07/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I've been feeling feverish the whole day. But temperature is normal. I did take a paracetamol and hope to feel better in the morning
19/07/2020, 18:54 - Bee: I hope you had a great time of worship and a great day. :)
19/07/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: Enough for breakfast and lunch!? That's a lot 😮
19/07/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I agree
19/07/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. How unfortunate for them. I think they may not have liked the colours on it. Try finding black cloth for them and maybe they'll like that 😁
19/07/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: !! I hope it's nothing too big. Praying for you Debby! I shouldn't have kept you up last night 😞
19/07/2020, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: Worship was good! I ended up wasting a lot of the day again 😕. Hopefully I won't waste too much of my night
19/07/2020, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: Ciba made biryani so I felt lethargic all through the afternoon
20/07/2020, 09:48 - Bee: Yes. Just finished lunch. You can guess what I had.
20/07/2020, 09:49 - Bee: I'm feeling alright today. I'm praying it doesn't spike it night.
20/07/2020, 09:49 - Bee: I don't think it was because I was up late. I napped in the afternoon and Stull felt feverish
20/07/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Still*
20/07/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Oh wow. Is that your first biryani in Ireland?
20/07/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Also, Ruth said 10:45pm tonight works for them. So 6:15pm for you. Is that okay?
20/07/2020, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: Momos?
20/07/2020, 09:52 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God! I'm praying with you as well. Rest lots! Looks like stitching is too strenuous a job for you 😶
20/07/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Nope they've made biryani before as well. And the first biryani I had in Ireland was at Rufus's church's Christmas event. That was authentic Hyderabadi biryani 😋
20/07/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me! Talk to you then 😊
20/07/2020, 13:22 - Bee: Sahi jawab
20/07/2020, 13:22 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. God is listening. No fever today!
20/07/2020, 13:23 - Bee: Ooh. Nothing beats authentic hyderabadi biryani
20/07/2020, 13:23 - Bee: Yep. 😊
21/07/2020, 09:09 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby. I hope your day's been good so far
21/07/2020, 09:11 - Nischal Abraham: I can't find any reason not to tell my parents today Bee. And I'm trying really hard to find reasons to postpone it but there seems no sense in delaying this
21/07/2020, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: I've been praying and it just feels like I need to do it. Maybe some time after your prayer meeting. But I can't help feeling this nervousness in my chest. It's just like Ruth said, I don't know what the right words to say are, or how I'm going to approach this. This feels like another test of faith for me and if that's the case I can't just rely on logical thinking
21/07/2020, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: All this just to ask that you continue in steadfast prayer as I know you have. I never really feared losing this relationship Debby, and as much as I feel a confidence in the outcome, that fear feels too real
21/07/2020, 10:03 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)
21/07/2020, 10:07 - Bee: I have this assurance from our God, as you have. And I'm led to talking with parents tonight too. I don't know what the words are either. But since I know this is from God, I know He will give the right words. That's the whole beauty of it. Complete dependence on God. 
I don't know how your parents will react (or mine even), but I know God will work it through. I think I'm telling myself all of this more than I'm telling you
21/07/2020, 10:08 - Bee: If it's possible, can we pray together? Before the talk
21/07/2020, 10:10 - Bee: I'm praying. Fervently.
21/07/2020, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'd like that. What time will you be free for a call?
21/07/2020, 10:11 - Bee: I'll be free before our prayer meeting. Around 2pm for you
21/07/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: 👍🏼. Sounds good to me. I'll be done with lunch by then too
21/07/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I'm done with lunch. Let me know when you get free too
21/07/2020, 14:11 - Bee: Hi. I'm free too
21/07/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Nischal
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Nischal
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Nischal
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Maybe your phone is not with you
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: And so if I keep messaging, it'll keep making the notif sound. If it's not on mute
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Heeyyyyyyyyyyyyy
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: I was just going to send around 20 messages more
21/07/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Yes
21/07/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Hey. Praying. 
The 'talk' is going to happen within the next hour.
Bye.
21/07/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Praying here too. And same :)
21/07/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. Let me know if we can get on a call when you're free
21/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Hi. Give me 15 minutes
21/07/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing
21/07/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Hey
21/07/2020, 19:20 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
21/07/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Me too
21/07/2020, 19:21 - Bee: I'll call?
21/07/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
22/07/2020, 10:03 - Bee: https://youtu.be/uiWZXLsdE9w
22/07/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Hope your day's been going well. How's the studying coming along?
22/07/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's lovely!
22/07/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: And they're singing is so good! I don't think I've heard that song before
22/07/2020, 12:17 - Bee: Studies aren't happening Nischal. :( Can't find the motivation
22/07/2020, 12:17 - Bee: I studied for a bit. Not as much as I'd like to
22/07/2020, 12:18 - Bee: Oh. It's called The Blessing (the song)
And this version has kids with special needs and kids speaking in ASL!! And newborns!
22/07/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: I did see some sign language come up. That's pretty cool
22/07/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: There's still time in the day if you want to study more
22/07/2020, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be honest that's my state with my project too though 😂
22/07/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Yes. I'm telling myself that. Feels like I'm making an excuse though
22/07/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Going for a walk. It's a beautiful day outside. Want to get out of the house for a but
22/07/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Bit*
22/07/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!!!!!
22/07/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Approval might just be my favorite word for a few days.
22/07/2020, 13:52 - Bee: 😭
22/07/2020, 13:53 - Bee: ☺️
22/07/2020, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely. It's been cloudy here. Looks like it'll rain soon
22/07/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: 😁. It is a wonderful thing
22/07/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Also it doesn't look likely that I'll finish the Bhakt Singh book by Sunday 😞
22/07/2020, 15:21 - Bee: It was lovely outside. I say on the park here for a while
22/07/2020, 15:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/07/2020, 15:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/07/2020, 15:22 - Bee: The 2 photos are just 1 minute apart. It was beautiful
22/07/2020, 15:23 - Nischal Abraham: That looks preettyy! Wasn't it hot?
22/07/2020, 15:24 - Bee: After walking for a while yes. It's not pleasant, but not hot either
22/07/2020, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: Which park did you go to?
22/07/2020, 15:24 - Bee: You can always read an ebook
22/07/2020, 15:24 - Bee: That's the one in my society itself
22/07/2020, 15:24 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Back home now?
22/07/2020, 15:25 - Bee: Yes. Just got back
22/07/2020, 15:25 - Bee: How's your day going?
22/07/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: It's been good. Got to spend time praying and reading in the afternoon so I don't feel like my whole day is a waste. I don't have my usual urge to waste time on YouTube which is nice
22/07/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Working on my project for a bit now. Hopefully get some exercise done after that... And I've got the Fairview Bible study today so hoping to attend that at 8
22/07/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Ahh. Sounds like a busy day
22/07/2020, 16:01 - Bee: I made whole wheat shortbread again. And they didn't burn this time. It's a win for me. I want to bake an apple pie for Jason's birthday but I don't know how it'll turn out in the convection microwave
22/07/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Is it Jason's birthday tomorrow?
22/07/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good! And what do you mean this time... I thought you said it turned out good last time too
22/07/2020, 16:41 - Bee: No it's on Saturday. But he's working and has a holiday on Sunday so we're having a special dinner then
22/07/2020, 16:42 - Bee: But a few were cooked extra. Almost burnt. (The ones on the periphery?) Took them out at the right time today
22/07/2020, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. So did you put it in twice of just removed the outer ones earlier?
22/07/2020, 17:28 - Bee: Yep. They're all evenly cooked
22/07/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! I'm feeling hungry just thinking about it
22/07/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Today's been such a low energy day
22/07/2020, 19:19 - Bee: 3 ingredients - wheat flour, sugar, butter
22/07/2020, 19:19 - Bee: Work on your project Nischal!!!! You have a meeting with your guide on Friday (right?). That's only two days away. Actually one day
22/07/2020, 19:20 - Bee: I spoke to Reenee after a looonng time today. It was nice
22/07/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: I burnt out working on it too much. So I decided to shift everything an hour earlier and now I'm sitting here finished with dinner
22/07/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Oh. All okay?
22/07/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Bible study in a bit right?
22/07/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! 😊. Did you have a long chat?
22/07/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: In 40 min
22/07/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'm good 😊. Just having a nice relaxed evening
22/07/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Yes. A long chat. I have her an update about us. I wanted to. Because it was her who God used to put in a thought about you in my mind for the first time
22/07/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Gave*
22/07/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: No more project work for tonight. I'll just read some after my Bible study and go to bed
22/07/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Oh. That's good. What was for dinner?
22/07/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Bhakt Singh?
22/07/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yep tis true. I'm very grateful for her being used by God too 😁
22/07/2020, 19:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/07/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: Bread, omelette with cheese, one peanut butter toast
22/07/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: Haha is that the background you put up on zoom? 😂
22/07/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
22/07/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Yes that's the one 😛
22/07/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: You look so cute ☺️
22/07/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Awww. Thank you, Nischal. ☺️
22/07/2020, 19:26 - Bee: My hair is growing long
22/07/2020, 19:27 - Bee: A plain omelette? Or with onions and stuff?
22/07/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well you could just cut it at home right? Ever since I cut my hair at home I don't worry about how long it gets too much cause I don't need to go to any place 😅
22/07/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Plain. I added oregano and chilli flakes in there
22/07/2020, 19:28 - Bee: You can try a fancier cut next time
22/07/2020, 19:29 - Bee: No I'm going to let my hair grow for a while now. I'll cut it for Jason's or Kevin's wedding. Whichever happens first
22/07/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. Are salons open there now?
22/07/2020, 19:30 - Bee: I'm not sure. They might be
22/07/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: If I could've I would've 😂
22/07/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Because on my walk I passed by vasant vihar and quite a few stores were open
22/07/2020, 19:31 - Bee: A couple stationary stores, a few restaurants but only for takeaway I think, one hardware store
22/07/2020, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Aren't you going to bed yet?
22/07/2020, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't it late already 😮. I don't know how you do it. I start feeling sleepy at 10 these days
22/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: I am in bed. Will go to sleep in a couple minutes
22/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: It is 12. Maybe because that's your usual sleep time
22/07/2020, 19:35 - Bee: I shall go to sleep
22/07/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Does it still feel unreal to you? It does to me. I'm gonna have to pinch you the next time I see you.
22/07/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. For whenever you go to sleep. ☺️
22/07/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Idk in a way it's the realest thing that I've ever felt. But as long as you don't pinch me too hard I'll be okay
22/07/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I guess it's better than having a late sleep time but wasting the night away
22/07/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I hope you have the sweetest of dreams
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Bee: We'll see how it goes on the day we meet
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Bee: If I'm dreaming of you, then I know it will be the sweetest. But I don't remember dreams in the morning usually
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Bee: Bye!
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Byee :)
23/07/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope you have a motivated and productive day today 😊
23/07/2020, 10:21 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
23/07/2020, 10:21 - Bee: ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️😊☺️☺️☺️☺️
23/07/2020, 10:21 - Bee: It's been good so far. The studying
23/07/2020, 10:22 - Bee: Do you have to submit anything today?
23/07/2020, 10:23 - Bee: Or tomorrow before your meeting?
23/07/2020, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: I should be submitting my dissertation draft today
23/07/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Oh. How much have you finished? Percentage wise
23/07/2020, 11:23 - Bee: I was on a video call with Joanne and Norah
23/07/2020, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know. It feels like 50% and 0% at the same time 😞
23/07/2020, 11:24 - Bee: 50% is good right
23/07/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Won't he give you corrections?
23/07/2020, 11:25 - Bee: Are you marked for your thesis? Or is it a compulsory project kinda thing?
23/07/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: The thesis is the majority of the marking. The code stuff is add on to it
23/07/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: Debby are you free for a call tonight at 10:45 pm
23/07/2020, 11:36 - Bee: Yes I am
23/07/2020, 11:36 - Bee: Should I be worried?
23/07/2020, 11:36 - Bee: We must keep a code word
23/07/2020, 11:37 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. It's actually with Sammy and Ruth. Is that alright?
23/07/2020, 11:37 - Bee: Yes yes
23/07/2020, 11:37 - Bee: What about your project work?
23/07/2020, 11:37 - Bee: Have you told them? Should I?
23/07/2020, 11:38 - Nischal Abraham: It's all been arranged. We're talking at 10:45pm tonight. That's their usual free time I guess
23/07/2020, 11:38 - Bee: Okay
23/07/2020, 11:38 - Bee: On zoom?
23/07/2020, 11:39 - Nischal Abraham: We'll see how Sammy sets it up 😂. But there will be a call
23/07/2020, 11:39 - Bee: Okay
23/07/2020, 11:39 - Bee: I'll make a PPT
23/07/2020, 11:39 - Nischal Abraham: If you have the time to 🤣🤣
23/07/2020, 11:40 - Bee: 😛
23/07/2020, 11:40 - Bee: I'll make time
23/07/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not sure if I'll be able to contribute
23/07/2020, 11:40 - Bee: That's okay
23/07/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
23/07/2020, 11:41 - Bee: This has a lot of words that I don't know
23/07/2020, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Its the blurriest pic I've taken maybe that's why
23/07/2020, 11:50 - Bee: When I read the caption I expected a photo of a gorgeous view in Ireland. Definitely not this
23/07/2020, 11:50 - Bee: See you at 10:45. Praying that you're able to finish all that you need to.
23/07/2020, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. It's been a sultry day today
23/07/2020, 11:54 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee! I really appreciate it 😊. Looking forward to seeing you!
23/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: I'm making a PPT. I won't show you until it's time. You're going to present. Okay bye
23/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: That sounds assertive
23/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: Would you like to present?
23/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: That's better
23/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: Okay bye.
23/07/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. I like assertive Debby
23/07/2020, 14:53 - Nischal Abraham: I don't like choices most of the time so I'll take it
23/07/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Cool. But assertive Debby can get out of hand and you must tell me when that happens
23/07/2020, 16:11 - Bee: I tried to make the PPT funny. Failed miserably. So made it with a different view now. So it's not funny okay
23/07/2020, 16:12 - Bee: You can make it humorous as you speak
23/07/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: I'll do my best
23/07/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Hi
23/07/2020, 18:02 - Bee: At 11? In half an hour
23/07/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I told Sammy and Ruth
23/07/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I don't mind
23/07/2020, 21:24 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
23/07/2020, 21:24 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))
23/07/2020, 21:24 - Bee: I've got so many things to talk about. I'm going to write them down otherwise I'll forget
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: You were typing
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: Please do write them
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: I will
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: First thing in the morning
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: No no. I was just gonna ask have you gone to sleep already but you replied immediately
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: Oh
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: Working on your project now?
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: Having dinner?
23/07/2020, 21:25 - Bee: Please do...
23/07/2020, 21:26 - Bee: Unless you're fasting and praying for Ruth
23/07/2020, 21:26 - Bee: 😛
23/07/2020, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: Working on dinner now. Then I'll read some and get up early tomorrow
23/07/2020, 21:26 - Bee: Okay
23/07/2020, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying. But it would be detrimental to fast for convenience
23/07/2020, 21:26 - Bee: Yes. Pray. I'll be praying too
23/07/2020, 21:27 - Bee: I told her I'll be playing Sword drill with every reference she mentions during the meeting
23/07/2020, 21:27 - Bee: 😂
23/07/2020, 21:27 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
23/07/2020, 21:27 - Nischal Abraham: Alright then. Goodnight again :). I hope it isn't too late for you to rest well
23/07/2020, 21:27 - Bee: I'll sleep okay
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Bee: Goodnight. :)))
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you always. It still feels a bit unreal to me
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Nischal Abraham: But no more tangents of conversation! I'll talk to you tomorrow
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Bee: I know right?!??????!!! Like there's a weird feeling you know.
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Bee: I was going to type some more but okay.
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Bee: Saving it for the next phone call.
23/07/2020, 21:28 - Bee: Bye.
23/07/2020, 21:29 - Nischal Abraham: Byeee
24/07/2020, 10:09 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby. I hope you have a good day. I'm worried about my meeting with my guide as my draft is still severely lacking 😕
24/07/2020, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: Please pray that I complete what needs to be done. I probably won't be online much today till the Bible study so I'll see you then!
24/07/2020, 10:16 - Bee: Morning, Nisch! :) I am having a good day.
24/07/2020, 10:17 - Bee: I'm praying that God enables you to finish.
24/07/2020, 10:17 - Bee: See you at the Bible study tonight
24/07/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Going to miss seeing you. And the Bible study. Hope you're completing is going alright and that your meeting goes well. Praying for you.
:)
24/07/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Your completion. Okay bye.
24/07/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
24/07/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: The meeting finally didn't happen. Guide was too busy today so it'll happen another day soon
24/07/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know if you can hop on a quick call if you aren't sleeping already. It's okay if you can't
24/07/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Just wanted to catch up is all :)
24/07/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Hi!!! Not sleeping yet. Give me 15 min?
24/07/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! Yea take your time. As long as it's not late for you
24/07/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Hi
24/07/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Nischal
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Nischal
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Where have you gone
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Is your internet off
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: .....
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Wru?
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!!
24/07/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Is there a name for this punctuation
¡
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Nischal?
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Knock knock
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Hi
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Nischal
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🍭
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🍫
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🍮
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🍢
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🍡
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🍬
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 😱
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 🤔
24/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: 😩
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Bee: ⚽
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Hi :)
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Bee: I'll call?
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't get a notification 😮
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
24/07/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Whatttttt
25/07/2020, 08:31 - Bee: Have a great day, bb! 😂
25/07/2020, 08:32 - Bee: Papa had some work at the post office. And so instead of sending an email, I wrote a letter and went along with papa to post it
25/07/2020, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! I hope your day has and will be a great one too 😊. Sounds like a fun day if you got to write and post a letter
25/07/2020, 11:41 - Bee: Yep. Too bad Ireland isn't among the 15 countries that the Indian Post is offering postal services to.
25/07/2020, 11:43 - Bee: I started reading The meaning of marriage. By Timothy Keller
25/07/2020, 11:43 - Bee: During the pandemic
25/07/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: There's still WhatsApp and email though!
25/07/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Online or you got a book?
25/07/2020, 13:27 - Bee: I downloaded the ebook
25/07/2020, 14:55 - Nischal Abraham: Nice. I feel so incredibly sleepy rn
25/07/2020, 14:56 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe my lunch was too heavy. But if I sleep now I won't sleep well at night 😞. Any tips on staying up?
25/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: Eat an apple
25/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: Go for a walk?
25/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: Grocery shopping?
25/07/2020, 14:57 - Nischal Abraham: That's new
25/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: Exercise
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: I don't want to head out now :(. It's such a sultry day
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: ?
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Work on your handstand
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: But I just ate!
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Oh
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Sing hymns
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Well I say just... It's been an hour. But still
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Talk to somebody
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Call someone you've been wanting to talk to but never got around to do it
25/07/2020, 14:58 - Bee: ?
25/07/2020, 14:59 - Bee: No?
25/07/2020, 14:59 - Bee: I'll think more
25/07/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. Not a bad idea. I'm not sure who that might be but I'll ask people
25/07/2020, 14:59 - Bee: Ankush?
25/07/2020, 14:59 - Bee: Rufus???!!!!
25/07/2020, 15:00 - Bee: I can't think of any other people
25/07/2020, 15:00 - Bee: I'm sure you know
25/07/2020, 15:00 - Bee: Not in a mood to read?
25/07/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby! That helps. Ankush was first person that came to mind as well but he's been so busy recently
25/07/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'll definitely fall asleep then 😂
25/07/2020, 15:01 - Bee: 😂
25/07/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Yes. Thought so
25/07/2020, 15:02 - Bee: I don't like reading in the afternoon
25/07/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: I like reading at night mostly. And it's not that reading itself puts me to sleep chase I can go on for a while without being sleepy
25/07/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Cause*
25/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: Oh
25/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: I made an apple pie
25/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: I really like it Nischal. I think that's why I'm making it often. Me wanting others to have a taste to is just an excuse
25/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: And Ashley helped me?! Voluntarily!!!
25/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: Spoke to Ankush?
25/07/2020, 16:28 - Bee: What's up?
25/07/2020, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Ankush isn't free today. We'll probably talk on Monday
25/07/2020, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Why are you so surprised to be helped by Ashley? He's a very helpful person Debby
25/07/2020, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: How did the apple pie turn out?
25/07/2020, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: I'm watching a video for a chicken recipe I'll probably never make
25/07/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcjFRAOiml0
25/07/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Oh
25/07/2020, 16:47 - Bee: He's hardly ever offered before
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: And he did everything I said Nischal
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: This is new
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: It's in the microwave
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Not done yet
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: 20 minutes more
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: What's it called? Is it a gravy dish?
25/07/2020, 16:48 - Bee: I will watch it
25/07/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: It's called creamy mustard chicken. Do you want me to share that video as well? I guess there's more of a chance you'll make it than I do anyway
25/07/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBlnMy-QWfY
25/07/2020, 16:59 - Bee: If it doesn't require fancy ingredients then yes I'll make it
25/07/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Cool
25/07/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Tonight we're going to marinate chicken for kebabs. Which we'll eat as chakna tomorrow
25/07/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Do you know what chakna is
25/07/2020, 17:00 - Bee: Jason and I
25/07/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Ah no this is the channel from which I usually make my stuff. But sometimes the cooking process is too long for me
25/07/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't chakna just meant to be snack? Or is there another meaning for it?
25/07/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Yes yes. Usually eaten along with alcohol
25/07/2020, 17:01 - Bee: A snack
25/07/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yep okay. Then it is what I thought it was
25/07/2020, 17:15 - Bee: What are you watching now?
25/07/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Talking to Nidhi
25/07/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Oh! Nice 😊
25/07/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Hope you had a lovely evening
25/07/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy worship and the party tomorrow 😁. I'm going to have some dinner now so if you haven't already gone to sleep you probably will by the time I'm back
25/07/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you always. Goodnight Bee!
25/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: I did
25/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Just finished marinating chicken for tomorrow
25/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Going to sleep in a bit
25/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: I hope you're having a a good day too. 😊
25/07/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Goodnight, marshmallow 😉
26/07/2020, 09:01 - Bee: Hey! Worship went well 😊
26/07/2020, 09:01 - Bee: I hope you have an amazing time of worship too.
26/07/2020, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I hope so too. Have fun celebrating!
26/07/2020, 14:18 - Bee: I attended Norah's cake cutting zoom meeting
26/07/2020, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: Ohhh. Is it Norah's birthday today?
26/07/2020, 14:35 - Bee: Yes
26/07/2020, 14:35 - Bee: Today
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! So how did the cake turn out?
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: She's outdone herself ya!!!
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/07/2020, 14:40 - Bee: This is for the family
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: Church family
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! That looks amazing!!! 😮
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: Yes!!!!
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: I couldn't even draw that on paper 😂
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: And Norah was tasting each color after the birthday song
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: Hahahahaaaaa
26/07/2020, 14:41 - Bee: Same
26/07/2020, 14:50 - Nischal Abraham: Naw Debby I'm sure you'd be able to draw that. So were you an aunty at the kids party again?
26/07/2020, 14:56 - Bee: I could but I would need a lot of time. I'd do it on paper first and then cut the cake into the shape so that I don't ruin it
26/07/2020, 14:56 - Bee: Nope. I was the youngest there
26/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: No wait. Jonathan was there too. (Jacinth akka's son)
26/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: It was Sammy's parents and sister, Jacinth akka and family, Reenee, and I
26/07/2020, 14:57 - Bee: That's all
26/07/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Oh okay. Sounds like a nice small gathering. So what else other than cake admiring took place?
26/07/2020, 15:56 - Bee: It was Norah being shy for most of it because she's never seen all of us together... She was a bit cranky
26/07/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Gaius uncle and fam sang a song and then he prayed. They they were talking about family stuff... Reenee and I left then. Felt like we were intruding
26/07/2020, 15:57 - Bee: What's up?
26/07/2020, 15:57 - Bee: How's your day going?
26/07/2020, 15:57 - Bee: When are you going rock climbing?
26/07/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Staying over at Daniel's?
26/07/2020, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: Battling lazy Sunday afternoon vibes
26/07/2020, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been good so far. Worship was good. Then I "tried" making potato mash for lunch but I'd put that in the fail list
26/07/2020, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: Probably in an hour
26/07/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. We'll be having the Bible study there and then all of us are staying over for the night 😁
26/07/2020, 16:01 - Bee: Did you add masala? Or is it the firangi mashed potatoes?
26/07/2020, 16:01 - Bee: Cool. I'm assuming dinner will be outside?
26/07/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
26/07/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: It was the plain one
26/07/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Oh
26/07/2020, 16:02 - Bee: With milk?
26/07/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Don't really know. I guess we'll decide after climbing
26/07/2020, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
26/07/2020, 16:04 - Bee: Oh
26/07/2020, 16:04 - Bee: Isn't it easy nana
26/07/2020, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Well the recipe is easy. Doesn't mean it can't be messed up
26/07/2020, 16:05 - Bee: Hmmmm. Maybe yes.
26/07/2020, 16:05 - Bee: I want to memorize verses Nischal
26/07/2020, 16:05 - Bee: I'm all pumped up now but I don't know if it will last
26/07/2020, 16:06 - Bee: The kebabs were yum!!!!!
26/07/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: That's a good pumped up to be! Just start at it and I'm sure you'll find a way to keep going
26/07/2020, 16:21 - Nischal Abraham: Kebabs!! Did you have charred veggies as well?
26/07/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Yes. Tomorrow.
26/07/2020, 16:27 - Bee: I will start
26/07/2020, 16:27 - Bee: No no. Had Dal and rice
26/07/2020, 16:27 - Bee: There's pork for dinner. Jason's favorite. The Mangalorean style
26/07/2020, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds tasty 😋. Surprising that its making me hungry even though it hasn't been that long since lunch
26/07/2020, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll talk to you later Debby! Daniel should be here any minute now
26/07/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: And in case it gets late, goodnight Bee 😊
26/07/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Wear your shoes and sit 😂
26/07/2020, 16:50 - Bee: ☺️
26/07/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Have fun!
26/07/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the tip 😁. I feel like I'll forget 10 other things trying to remember to wear my shoes now
27/07/2020, 08:25 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I have a feeling you woke up even before I went to sleep. We had a looong night of conversation and laugher. Went to bed at 2 finally 😂
27/07/2020, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: The rest of my day is going to be head down in project work. I've asked to meet my guide today as well. Please pray that I get the words to write and that I do due diligence to this project.
27/07/2020, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: Praying that you have a good day! I'll try and catch up in the evening. But there is a call with Ankush that I'm expecting to have so it may just be through messages tonight
27/07/2020, 09:05 - Bee: Hi Nischal!! ☺️
27/07/2020, 09:06 - Bee: Whoooaa that's late for you!! Some amazing things must have happened if it kept you up until 2
27/07/2020, 09:06 - Bee: Are you back home?
I'll be praying Nischal. Let me know what time is the meeting
27/07/2020, 09:07 - Bee: That's okay.
27/07/2020, 09:07 - Bee: Also, you don't have to keep messaging okay? We'll take whenever we talk. You work on your project, which I know you will. Don't worry about messaging
27/07/2020, 09:09 - Bee: I have no plans for today. It's Philip uncle's birthday so I dropped off some pork and paysum (not sure if that's how it's spelt) in the morning. Deep-cleaned the house after that. Felt really good. I read some and watch some and hopefully memorize some for the rest of today
27/07/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Hey! I hope your meeting with your guide went well. Still praying. In case it's not over.
27/07/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Goodnight, for whenever you go to sleep.
27/07/2020, 19:24 - Bee: :)
27/07/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Meeting did go well. Thank you for praying 😊. There's a lot of work I do need to do
27/07/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lot of plans to me 😂. Hope you got all of those things done
27/07/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for being so understanding about me not replying immediately. I'm not sure if I'll be very free for the next 3-4 days but I hope we get to talk if even for a little bit in that time
27/07/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Got to talk to Ankush as well. Didn't really talk about a whole lot. I guess all my plans will have to wait for the 31st now
27/07/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'm praying you have a good day tomorrow too 😁
27/07/2020, 20:54 - Bee: Hi Nischal. I'm finding it difficult to fall asleep. Pray for me?
I'll reply to your messages tomorrow if that's okay
27/07/2020, 23:23 - Nischal Abraham: Praying fervently. I hope when you read this you have been well rested
28/07/2020, 08:18 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
28/07/2020, 08:18 - Bee: I did fall asleep eventually. Thank you for praying. I kept tossing and turning even though I was sleepy
28/07/2020, 08:19 - Bee: Praise God! Continuing to pray. Going to be a few busy days
28/07/2020, 08:20 - Bee: Noooo I didn't :( I had to run errands with papa. I didn't mind at all. Got to drive around 🤷🏽‍♀️
28/07/2020, 08:21 - Bee: What ya Nischal. You make me sound like a dictator. 😂
28/07/2020, 08:22 - Bee: Don't worry about talking. But if you do have a few minutes to spare then that'll be great. No compulsion. I'm here whenever
28/07/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: No "compulsion"? Sounds suspicious to me 🤔
28/07/2020, 11:37 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Enjoy whatever you plan for today 😊
28/07/2020, 11:47 - Bee: Huh? I'll explain over a phone call if you want. But again, no compulsion. :P
28/07/2020, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: Haha I am just kidding. But if there is something to explain over the phone I'll let you know how my work turns out. I'll probably be freeer to talk tomorrow
28/07/2020, 16:42 - Bee: Okay! Looking forward to tomorrow. If we get to talk or even if we don't
28/07/2020, 16:42 - Bee: I have to organize all my cupboards and shelves. It's hard to find what I'm looking for. That's what I'm doing tomorrow
28/07/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Hope you're having a productive day
28/07/2020, 16:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/07/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Bb, FINISH IT!!!! ( said in the tone of 'Finish him' from Mortal Kombat
28/07/2020, 19:26 - Bee: )
28/07/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Bye :))
28/07/2020, 22:41 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! Though it's looking worse and worse as the minutes pass by. Well I'll let you know how things look tomorrow. Goodnight!
29/07/2020, 09:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
29/07/2020, 09:24 - Bee: Good morning, bb.
29/07/2020, 09:24 - Bee: I hope you have a gooooood day. :))
29/07/2020, 13:31 - Nischal Abraham: That's good practice. There's really no reason why you shouldn't
29/07/2020, 13:33 - Nischal Abraham: Good evening! Really sorry for the late reply. I have been quite occupied with my project today. And it's looking like that'll be the case for the rest of the day too 😶
29/07/2020, 13:33 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you've been having a good day!
29/07/2020, 15:27 - Bee: In my mind I'm telling this to all those who don't use their indicators
29/07/2020, 15:27 - Bee: That's okay Nischal. :)
29/07/2020, 15:28 - Bee: I am having a good day. Baked a carrot cake. It turned out okay. Not bad. But could be better
29/07/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Are you implying I don't use indicators? 😱
29/07/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm carrot cake 😋
29/07/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Time seems to move so fast when you want all the hours available in the day 😐. I've got a weird pain in my neck. I think I slept awkwardly last night. Or I'm sitting awkwardly for my project. Hopefully it's the former
29/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Where did this come from?!?!
29/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Like...how?!??
29/07/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Too healthy ya. I used atta instead of maida.
29/07/2020, 19:04 - Bee: Are you sitting at the dining table and working? No that might be too noisy. Maybe both then. Awkward sleeping and sitting position. I prayed and trust that the pain will go
29/07/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Psalm 121:2: 
My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.

Psalm 139:16: 
All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.

2 Corinthians 12:9: 
But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.

1 Samuel 7:12: 
Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far the Lord has helped us.” 
(This is from the _recipe_ )
29/07/2020, 19:08 - Bee: It's okay if you don't reply.
29/07/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Goodnight (for when you go to sleep). I hope you're eating alright Nischal
29/07/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Messages aren't getting delivered. Turned your internet off for the rest of the day? Did I message too late? Nooooooo.
29/07/2020, 19:23 - Bee: !!!
29/07/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Bye. Again.
29/07/2020, 19:44 - Bee: I'm sorry about the late reply Nischal
29/07/2020, 20:00 - Nischal Abraham: 😊. Thank you. You're too cute Debby
30/07/2020, 05:26 - Bee: Cute? That's all? What ya
30/07/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Hope you have a great day. I'll take my time and respond to your messages when I get time
30/07/2020, 10:39 - Bee: Okay Nischal
30/07/2020, 10:39 - Bee: :)
30/07/2020, 10:40 - Nischal Abraham: Btw, would you be free for a call anytime today? Like a really short one 😅
30/07/2020, 10:44 - Bee: Do you have the time?
30/07/2020, 10:44 - Bee: I'll be free around my 11. Your 6:30
30/07/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: I think I need to make the time
30/07/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... I'll try and be free then. I'm still not sure when my guide is meeting with me so I'll confirm when I find out
30/07/2020, 10:49 - Bee: Yep tis true
30/07/2020, 10:50 - Bee: What time works for you?
30/07/2020, 10:54 - Bee: 12:00-2:30
4:30 onwards whenever
I'm free during these hours.(both your time, Irish Standard Time) 
Shouldn't be a problem for me since it's a short call. 
Let me know what works for you
30/07/2020, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks. My guide said he'll meet in the afternoon but meetings have been postponed indefinitely before so I'll let you know when I know
30/07/2020, 11:37 - Bee: Okay
30/07/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Meeting is at 2:30. So I think it'll be best if I call you at my 6:30. Okay?
30/07/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Okay. Looking forward to it.
30/07/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. I'm free when you are
30/07/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: I know I'm early but just letting you know :)
30/07/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Nischal
30/07/2020, 18:35 - Bee: I'm going to need some more time
30/07/2020, 18:35 - Bee: In 20 plans?
30/07/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Minutes*
30/07/2020, 18:35 - Bee: I'm sorry if it clashes with your plans :(
30/07/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sure sure. Let me know when you're free
30/07/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Okay.
30/07/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: I have no other fixed plans for the evening
30/07/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Hi
30/07/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Nischal

30/07/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Marshmallow
30/07/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Marshy
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Nisch
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Wru
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Noooooo
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Hi

30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🐣
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🦉
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🐙
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🦑
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🥬
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🥨
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🍞

30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🍔
30/07/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 🥠
30/07/2020, 18:58 - Bee: HI!!!!!!!
30/07/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
30/07/2020, 18:58 - Bee: I'll call?
30/07/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
30/07/2020, 20:07 - Bee: It was lovely hearing your voice.
You'll probably read this after you've had dinner and are sitting to work on the code. 
I hope the noodles turned out great and you've eaten well since you skipped lunch. And that you've got the energy and drive to work.
I'm praying and I know that God will give you the grace and strength to finish it well before time. God is faithful in giving His children all they need. 
P.S - heard you laughing after a while (since we last spoke obv) and it was wonderful. Makes me want to make you lol more often. 
Finish the project like it's the last piece of Claire's Aunty's dessert.
30/07/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Don't reply!!!!!!
30/07/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Bye. :)
30/07/2020, 20:09 - Bee: Not Claire's Aunty's dessert but Claire Aunty's dessert. Bye. Don't reply, bb. Everything after 31st.
30/07/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
30/07/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't have noticed if you didn't point it out. But I am actually lol now that you have
31/07/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Debby. Need a quick favour if you have the time
31/07/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
31/07/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Yes tell me
31/07/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Just tell me if you can see the signature and the date on page 2
31/07/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Yes I can see the sign and date
31/07/2020, 17:17 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/07/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Ah perfect. I just wanted to confirm since I did it through the PDF software
31/07/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Ahh. Your cute sign is seen
31/07/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Let me know when I can start celebrating
31/07/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Now
31/07/2020, 17:30 - Bee: NISCHAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍🥰😁🥳🤗👏🏽👊🏽💫💥🔥

31/07/2020, 17:31 - Bee: PRAISE GOD!!!!!!! YOU FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Wow. You read my thoughts exactly!
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Dissertation done!!!!!!!!!!!!!
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Like WHOOOAAAAAA
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep yep
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Bee: IKR?!?!??????!!!!!???? My thoughts are incoherent
31/07/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: End of another chapter
31/07/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Probably the best one so far?
31/07/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Another event to praise God by, another season of His faithfulness fully experienced
31/07/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Nischal yaaaaaaaa.
31/07/2020, 17:33 - Bee: You're going to look back at this moment in the future. So many times!! And remind yourself that God is faithful!
31/07/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Well if I consider the start to be me selecting Maynooth as my university last year... And EVERYTHING that happened since then is part of the chapter... Then yes. This is the best one so far
31/07/2020, 17:34 - Bee: 🥺
31/07/2020, 17:34 - Bee: I'm crying Nischal
31/07/2020, 17:34 - Bee: I'm so happy.
31/07/2020, 17:34 - Bee: ☺️
31/07/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Good thing you've written it all down.
31/07/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Aww don't cry!
31/07/2020, 17:35 - Bee: No no happy tears
31/07/2020, 17:35 - Bee: The good cry
31/07/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Good cry is good 😁. So how's your day been!?
31/07/2020, 17:36 - Bee: I thought you would say all kinds of cry is good
31/07/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Are*
31/07/2020, 17:37 - Bee: A huge sigh of relief Nischal
31/07/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Still not over this
31/07/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Crying isn't bad, but I don't know about all of them being good
31/07/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: I just don't want to get up for a few minutes now
31/07/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Don't!!!!!!
31/07/2020, 17:38 - Bee: What do you want to do?
31/07/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Sing? Dance?
31/07/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Pray? Write in your journal?
31/07/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Right now... Just lie back and pray
31/07/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Have a proper flashback of the whole of last year
31/07/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Then do it!!!
31/07/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Recall all instances of God's goodness. Times that made you laugh, cry. Times that forced you to lean on God. Times which taught you lessons
31/07/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. I'm done doing nothing now
31/07/2020, 17:52 - Bee: ☺️
31/07/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Have you eaten lunch?
31/07/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
31/07/2020, 17:56 - Bee: Are you going to eat now? Or dinner directly?
31/07/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Well I guess eating now is eating dinner. But the kitchen doesn't seem to be free
31/07/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: They're having a party here tomorrow so there's a lot of prep going on for that today
31/07/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Oh wow. There'll be good food
31/07/2020, 18:02 - Bee: What are your plans for the rest of the day?
31/07/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Since the kitchen is occupied I was thinking if I should head to the shops. It'll be nice getting out of the house. Haven't done that all week
31/07/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Just a tad concerned about the lack of food in my belly before I leave the house though 🤔
31/07/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Do you have biscuits or a bar of chocolate?
31/07/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Is there a Subway nearby?
31/07/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: I've exhausted all my snacks. Project work tends to make me very snacky it would seem
31/07/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Its quite the paradox... I must shop for more food... But I need food to go shopping...
31/07/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Make instant noodles no. Won't take long. You'll be in the kitchen only for a few
31/07/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that is true... Noodles and an egg sounds so good right now 🤤
31/07/2020, 18:22 - Bee: So you're eating and then going?
31/07/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: I'll go and check how the kitchen looks. If it's too crowded I'll probably just go shopping first instead
31/07/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Kitchen looks suuuper busy. I'm just going shopping then.
31/07/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: I managed to finish my submission before you went to sleep though 😁
31/07/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Okay
31/07/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Praise God that you did!
31/07/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Good job, Nischal.
31/07/2020, 18:45 - Bee: I'm proud of you.
31/07/2020, 18:46 - Bee: And in awe.
31/07/2020, 18:56 - Bee: You completed 321 days in Ireland. No I'm not counting
31/07/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Bye.
31/07/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: That's a strong reaction to have about me shopping
31/07/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: All glory to God alone 😊
31/07/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'll assume it's wrong then 😂
31/07/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
31/07/2020, 20:16 - Bee: It wasn't a reaction to you shopping
31/07/2020, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... How come you're still awake?
31/07/2020, 20:24 - Nischal Abraham: Or I guess network delays
31/07/2020, 20:31 - Bee: Can't fall asleep. Thinking too much
31/07/2020, 20:31 - Bee: Huh?
31/07/2020, 20:45 - Bee: It isn't. Ofc I'm counting. Not me me. But the countdown widget.
31/07/2020, 20:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Too excited because of my news?
31/07/2020, 20:48 - Nischal Abraham: Cause my messages weren't getting delivered so I thought you went to sleep earlier but your message only got sent to me now
31/07/2020, 20:48 - Nischal Abraham: I know you're counting. I haven't counted since NFS
01/08/2020, 08:13 - Bee: Haha maybe. I did fall sleep eventually
01/08/2020, 08:14 - Bee: Asleep*
01/08/2020, 08:14 - Bee: Ahh
01/08/2020, 08:16 - Bee: I hope you have a good day today. With whatever you've planned. Even if you plan on doing nothing.
01/08/2020, 08:44 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Debby. I do plan on joining the Bible study so there's two things to do on the list already
01/08/2020, 08:44 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon to you! I hope you have a fun day too 😁
01/08/2020, 08:57 - Bee: What's the other thing?
01/08/2020, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: Well one is to study lamentations and the other is the Bible study
01/08/2020, 09:10 - Bee: Oh
01/08/2020, 09:10 - Bee: Like thaaatt

01/08/2020, 15:07 - Bee: I'll need a month to finish everything
01/08/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Only a month? That's pretty good! What's for dinner?
01/08/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: And also short call tonight?
01/08/2020, 15:22 - Bee: I think there's egg curry and some vegetable

01/08/2020, 15:22 - Bee: What time?

01/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: It was a heart
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: I've never sent you a heart before
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: This has a heart
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: According to what I remember
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: It was a heart heart
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: So does this kne
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: The one that beats
01/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Nooo these aren't hearts by themselves
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: They have more than hearts
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: That one has 2 of them 😮
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: You didn't question the octopus and you're asking about the one I deleted
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 😒
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Wait that's not an octopus
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: What is this?
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Squids are valid random emoji right?
01/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Is it a squid?
01/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Yes yes
01/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: A heart is not a random emoji
01/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Why would I question the basis of something you've already set
01/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Is it not?
01/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: No it's now
01/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Then why ask about the one I deleted?!
01/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Not* 🤦🏽‍♀️
01/08/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Because if it's a random emoji then there's no reason to delete it
01/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Hmmmm. But it wasn't a random emoji
01/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Where did you go
01/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: No don't go

02/08/2020, 10:43 - Bee: ☺️
02/08/2020, 10:44 - Bee: Have a nice day!
02/08/2020, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hope worship was a good time! Was there family hour since today is the first Sunday?
02/08/2020, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'm feeling much better today Debby. I guess I will go for the climb after all. Looking forward to seeing Daniel, Diane and Hannah ☺️
02/08/2020, 11:57 - Bee: Yes we had having hour. The senior Sunday school kids prepared a presentation on the lives of a few missionaries whose were mentioned by Frikkie uncle in his Bible studies
02/08/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Family*
02/08/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Whose names*
02/08/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Had prawns biryani for lunch. Ate a lot. Very sleepy now
02/08/2020, 11:59 - Bee: I'm glad you're feeling better. Eat well okay?
02/08/2020, 11:59 - Bee: How come you're gonna see Diane and Hannah? Are they accompanying y'all too? Or will you be heading over to theirs after
02/08/2020, 11:59 - Bee: Have fun, Nischal!
02/08/2020, 12:01 - Bee: I'm gonna take a short nap
02/08/2020, 12:02 - Bee: A Sunday afternoon is incomplete without a nap
02/08/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Biryani is very sleep inducing. Enjoy your nap Debby!
02/08/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Will be heading over after for dinner
02/08/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds wonderful. Must've been a nice time indeed 😊
02/08/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: I guess I've been living incomplete Sundays for most of my life then 😂
02/08/2020, 13:51 - Bee: What are you doing with your Sundays Nischal??!!!?!?!
02/08/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Oh. That's nice :)
02/08/2020, 13:52 - Bee: It was. They prepared about 8 missionaries. But could present only 2 because the time was up. These kids I tell you. Went faaar beyond!
02/08/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: Going rock climbing it would seem. That was a short nap... I thought you wouldn't reply for another 3 hours
02/08/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Yeah I don't want to be up at night. And then wake up.late tomorrow. Which will lead to another late night
02/08/2020, 19:53 - Bee: Bb
02/08/2020, 19:53 - Bee: 🤗
02/08/2020, 19:53 - Bee: Goodnight!
02/08/2020, 22:45 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you read this 😊. I hope the rest of your day was good. Climbing was fun today and I had some nice conversation at Daniel's
02/08/2020, 22:45 - Nischal Abraham: Remind me to tell you about it when we talk tomorrow
03/08/2020, 07:59 - Bee: I will 😊
03/08/2020, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: Can we talk tonight?
03/08/2020, 09:56 - Bee: Yes!!!!!
03/08/2020, 09:56 - Bee: I'll let you know when I'm free? Mostly 11-11:15ish
03/08/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome. Looking forward to it 😊. What's your plans for the day?
03/08/2020, 10:09 - Bee: No plans Nischal
03/08/2020, 10:09 - Bee: Will you give me some ideas please
03/08/2020, 10:09 - Bee: I don't know what to do
03/08/2020, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Read a book? Cook something new?
03/08/2020, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Learn a new language, find a game to play, bother Ashley
03/08/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: Catch up with someone you haven't spoken to in a long time
03/08/2020, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: Try learning a new skill, study for the exam, study for IELTS
03/08/2020, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: Do a study on a portion of the Bible
03/08/2020, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: Watch a movie, make your own movie, start a new TV show
03/08/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Exercise, handstand practice, learn to do a middle split
03/08/2020, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: Play the ukulele, write a song, learn a new song, record yourself playing said song
03/08/2020, 11:03 - Nischal Abraham: Start a journal, listen to music, help your mom with something she's doing
03/08/2020, 11:07 - Bee: 🥺
03/08/2020, 11:08 - Bee: Wow. This is everything that should be doing instead of wasting time :O
03/08/2020, 11:08 - Bee: That I*
03/08/2020, 11:09 - Bee: I already bothered Ashley quite a bit... Any more and I'm asking for it in return. So I'll leave that for tomorrow
03/08/2020, 11:13 - Bee: Here's what I'll do :
1. Do you remember about that website I told you about (in the beginning of lockdown) that prints photos into Polaroids and is really cheap? I'll shortlist photos for that. This is Start a journal bit (or scrapbook)
2. Read a little of The meaning of marriage
3. Exercise. No middle splits though :/ sounds like another ambitious dream alongside the handstand
4. Memorize a few verses. And study that portion too?
5. I already played the ukulele in the morning. Tried playing a new hymn but I sucked. I'll give that another go.

I can add more items but I don't know if I'll do all of it.
03/08/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Thanks Nischal. This may not be another wasted day after all.
03/08/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh your list of things to do sounds so much better than my random suggestions 😂. I'm glad some of it helped. Hope you enjoy your day! I have some plans on working on my CV today and looking at available jobs so hopefully I stay productive too
03/08/2020, 11:23 - Bee: What?! All of it is from what you suggested
03/08/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: It's better to just decide on 2 or 3 things and stick to those for a day than having a million things and not doing any. Your list seems really good. I wouldn't add any more to it
03/08/2020, 11:47 - Bee: I won't. I'll tell you how it's going
03/08/2020, 13:20 - Bee: The photos took so long :O I ended up going through all of the ones I have and felt nostalgic
03/08/2020, 13:20 - Bee: Now I will read
03/08/2020, 13:43 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. Yea going through old stuff is a nice experience ☺️
03/08/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I exercised. Read some. Haven't memorized anything yet
03/08/2020, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: I just finished exercising too. Had a fairly nice day so far. Looking forward to our call ☺️
03/08/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Me too, Nischal, me too. :)
03/08/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm free whenever you are so just let me know
03/08/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Okay. I need to take a shower

04/08/2020, 07:56 - Bee: Are those the waterproof pants which look like formal trousers?
04/08/2020, 07:58 - Bee: Today :
1. Exercise
2. Memorize
3. Stitch a button onto my skirt which is missing a button
4. Gaimukh
5. Find out what a chowpatty is
6. Thread my eyebrows (we'll see how it goes)
7. Talk to you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ☺️
04/08/2020, 08:33 - Bee: 8. Read
04/08/2020, 08:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea! I didn't even notice the wall 😂. Most of the gym has a pretty colour palette
04/08/2020, 08:50 - Nischal Abraham: Nope those are just normal track pants. I didn't realise how formal they look till the picture was taken. It must be the shirt
04/08/2020, 08:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's a lot of things! Busy day for you. I hope you're able to do many of them 😊. Will you be threading your own eyebrows?
04/08/2020, 10:36 - Bee: It's warm enough to go out in track pants :O
04/08/2020, 10:37 - Bee: I stitched the button
04/08/2020, 10:37 - Bee: Yes. I think one side is slightly thinner than the other 😂
04/08/2020, 10:37 - Bee: Just finished threading
04/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: At least you aren't going out to see a lot of people so I'm sure it'll grow back all even before then
04/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Some days it's warm enough to not even need a jumper. But today is not one of those days
04/08/2020, 11:42 - Bee: That's good right? You like the cold
04/08/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it's not the worst. But just as I say that the sun is back out now 😂
04/08/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Sunny is good
04/08/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Gaimukh is happening nana!!!

05/08/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: It looks so pretty!
05/08/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: Where is it?
05/08/2020, 10:28 - Bee: This is Gaimukh chowpatty
05/08/2020, 10:28 - Bee: Took a photo from outside the gate
05/08/2020, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! It doesn't look like you're outside the gate... It's still pretty up close
05/08/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: When you said beach I was expecting sand Debby 😶
05/08/2020, 10:29 - Bee: I was expecting sand too 😩
05/08/2020, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: It looks lovely anyway. Too bad you couldn't go in 😞
05/08/2020, 12:05 - Bee: Yeah. But I got to drive so 🤷🏽‍♀️
05/08/2020, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: This is true. Btw I've got my Bible study at Fairview today so I won't be free for a call after 8pm. Do you still want to get on an actual "short" call?
05/08/2020, 12:59 - Bee: Can we talk tomorrow instead?
05/08/2020, 13:00 - Bee: I've had a headache since morning and I think it's because I stayed up too late last night. I'll go to sleep early today
05/08/2020, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me. Rest well today then Bee! I hope the headache isn't too bad 😮
05/08/2020, 13:04 - Bee: All fine now. Looking at screens too much might have been a reason too. Kept everything aside until now and the headache is gone
05/08/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Drink loads of water and sleep well!
05/08/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: You don't even need to reply to these. We'll chat later
05/08/2020, 13:20 - Bee: Replying. Keeping phone aside now. Byeee bb
05/08/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Byee. Praying for you
05/08/2020, 15:03 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/08/2020, 15:03 - Bee: She was telling me that it's important to eat fruits and vegetables when I showed her the packet of Lays I was eating from
05/08/2020, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: She's not wrong 😂
05/08/2020, 16:31 - Bee: 😂
05/08/2020, 16:32 - Bee: True.
05/08/2020, 16:32 - Bee: But fruits don't taste as good as Indian magic masala
05/08/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: As long as that's not all you're having. How's the headache?
05/08/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Yep I had a full dinner. No headache now. Been okay since 6ish
05/08/2020, 18:13 - Bee: I spoke to Animesh!!! My friend from school. It was nice catching up and talking about fun stuff that happened back then 😊
05/08/2020, 18:28 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/08/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. Is that Eliana?
05/08/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! I'm catching up with Ankush tomorrow
05/08/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to hear too 😊. Glad you're feeling better
05/08/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Yes. 🥺 Why Nischal. Whhhyyyy!!! How??!!!!!!!!
05/08/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Why? That's not the response I expected. Why what?
05/08/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Ooh
05/08/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Why me. How me? Blessed with so many kids around. Who like me??!!??!!!
05/08/2020, 18:38 - Bee: :). Thank you for praying, bb
05/08/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: It's a blessing to be blessed 😁. I really hope things open up and you get to see them again soon
05/08/2020, 18:40 - Bee: I hope so too. I was thinking we could go to theirs (downstairs) and see them from a distance. But then the goodbye would be too hard for me and the kids too. So decided not to
05/08/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: It's probably best to wait till you can see them proper. Half measured hellos just make it so much harder
05/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Yes. I don't want to wait but I will
05/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: How's your day going?
05/08/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
05/08/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Feels different not talking to you at night. Like I'm missing an important part of my nighttime routine
05/08/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Bye!
05/08/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good today. Finished my Résumé and had feedback from my dad and Cherian
05/08/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Spoke to my parents in the afternoon
05/08/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Started a new anime that's really nice
05/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I felt the same. But it just makes me feel the next time we talk would be that much more precious
05/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Enjoy 9 hours of sleep 😁
05/08/2020, 19:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/08/2020, 19:20 - Bee: I will. ☺️
06/08/2020, 10:42 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! Hope you have an enjoyable day! How was the night?
06/08/2020, 11:05 - Bee: Hi Nischal ☺️
06/08/2020, 11:07 - Bee: I woke up at 10 😯 nobody woke me up and the curtains were all drawn and it was raining heavily. Best weather to sleep in
06/08/2020, 11:08 - Bee: How did the Bible study go? Have you spoken to Ankush yet? Or is the call for the evening
06/08/2020, 11:08 - Bee: What're your plans for today?
06/08/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: That's a nice long amount of sleep! You must be super well rested now
06/08/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: Bible study was alright. Will be talking to Ankush at 10pm so there's still some time
06/08/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: I worked on updating my CV a bit more and looked at job postings online. Can't seem to focus too well today though 😐. Feeling very restless
06/08/2020, 13:04 - Bee: Why what's up? Too much time at hand? Do you want to talk?
06/08/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know. Like I want to be productive but maybe I'm trying too hard to be... So every minute just feels wasted. Well I'll be going shopping after lunch so maybe a walk will help
06/08/2020, 13:13 - Bee: OH I understand what you're talking about. A lot of lockdown has felt like that for me
06/08/2020, 13:13 - Bee: A walk will help 😁
06/08/2020, 13:13 - Bee: I just came back from a 30 minute walk. It's drizzling and windy and gloomy and lovely outside
06/08/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Sounds like your favourite kind of weather 😊. Its cloudy here too but I really hope it doesn't drizzle when I go shopping. I haven't opened an umbrella since lockdown started
06/08/2020, 13:35 - Bee: You better hurry then! Before it starts raining
06/08/2020, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: Decided against going shopping today. I'll probably do it tomorrow. How's your day been so far?
06/08/2020, 14:42 - Bee: It was alright. Uneventful. Woke up late, skipped breakfast and had lunch directly. Watched a couple YouTube videos, went for a walk, and then attended an online Bible study which Berachah invited me to
06/08/2020, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't there Bible study for Bethesda as well today?
06/08/2020, 16:26 - Bee: Hi!!
06/08/2020, 16:26 - Bee: There was
06/08/2020, 16:26 - Bee: And you were there
06/08/2020, 16:26 - Bee: Don't you remember?
06/08/2020, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: Must've slipped my mind. I'm a very forgetful person
06/08/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Add some more almonds to your pays oats
06/08/2020, 17:28 - Bee: What no
06/08/2020, 17:28 - Bee: To your oats*
06/08/2020, 17:30 - Bee: I'm assuming 10pm call is 10pm my time because 10pm your time will be too late which means I'll probably be asleep by the time you're done
06/08/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I can't find my lip balm :(
06/08/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: It was. And now I'm done
06/08/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Where did you last put it?
06/08/2020, 18:23 - Bee: What's done?
06/08/2020, 18:23 - Bee: I don't remember. I last used it in March. Been using Vaseline since
06/08/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Oh the phone call?
06/08/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
06/08/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
06/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Ahh
06/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: I found my lip balm. It was kept carefully in a pouch with my other stuff
06/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy!
06/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Are you going to sleep now?
06/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: No I'll be up for a while. I'm not sleepy
06/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: What are you doing?
06/08/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Thinking of asking if it's okay if we get on a call today
06/08/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: But if it's too late that's okay
06/08/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Did you finish thinking?
06/08/2020, 19:00 - Bee: What have you decided?
06/08/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Give me 10?
06/08/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Okay!
06/08/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Nischal
06/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Nischhhhhhhhaaaallll
06/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Nisch?
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Hi
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Bb
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Blue ticks!!!!!¡
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Hi!!
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: I'll call?
06/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
07/08/2020, 09:41 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! ☺️
07/08/2020, 09:42 - Bee: I went to the bank with Manali didi...no other plans for today. There's sisters meeting and our extended family meeting. That's all
07/08/2020, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I worked on my Resume again. Made good progress today so feeling good 😊
07/08/2020, 11:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be having my Bible study with the climbing guys so could we skip out on a call tonight?
07/08/2020, 12:27 - Bee: Sure sure. Let me know what heresies y'all bring up 😂
07/08/2020, 12:32 - Bee: Nischal
07/08/2020, 12:33 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: Haha yea will do 😂
07/08/2020, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... I guess if I'm the other pea in the pod I'm hapPea too ☺️
07/08/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Hahaha aww. Aren't you a cutie.
07/08/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Started, ofc.
07/08/2020, 13:18 - Bee: No
07/08/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Starred*
07/08/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: When's the sisters meeting?
07/08/2020, 13:27 - Bee: In 2 minutes
07/08/2020, 14:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: WOAH!!! So many kids in one room 😱
07/08/2020, 16:34 - Bee: YES!!!! I started squealing
07/08/2020, 16:34 - Bee: It was such a fun chat! These mums are amazing
07/08/2020, 16:34 - Bee: And kids also ofc
07/08/2020, 16:35 - Bee: How's your day going?
07/08/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Did you go grocery shopping
07/08/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been alright since afternoon. I did go shopping finally but couldn't find a beef I'd be comfortable working with 😞
07/08/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Or more accurately the different labels didn't make any sense to me
07/08/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Well anywho I'll probably just stick to chicken and try more complicated dishes for that
07/08/2020, 17:34 - Bee: You could ask Cherian, Jibu or Ciba?
07/08/2020, 17:34 - Bee: That's good. One thing at a time
07/08/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Have you shortlisted a recipe?
07/08/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Mom had sent me a recipe for beef cause I asked. But I'll just have to get a chicken recipe now
07/08/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Oh
07/08/2020, 17:39 - Bee: You want a gravy preparation?
07/08/2020, 17:41 - Bee: https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/chicken-curry/#wprm-recipe-container-38246
07/08/2020, 17:41 - Bee: The author says you can skip the whole spices if you don't have them. I think you may have everything else
07/08/2020, 17:43 - Bee: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cookstr.com/Indian-Recipes/Chicken-Curry-Sanjeev-Kapoor/amp

This one is easier but requires spices
07/08/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Would you prefer follow a video instead of a written recipe?
07/08/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Following*
07/08/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: I think written instructions works better for me. Thanks for the recipes! I'll have to try them soon 😊
07/08/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Okay
07/08/2020, 17:46 - Bee: What thanks and all
07/08/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Send photos after you try
07/08/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: I will never not thank you for thinks to be thanked for
07/08/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: What did you have for dinner?
07/08/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Okay
07/08/2020, 17:47 - Bee: I had chicken biryani
07/08/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Jason had to go to Andheri for some office work and decided that he'll meet Priya and come. So mummy made chicken biryani for her family and so made some for us
07/08/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Do you want to try biryani?
07/08/2020, 17:47 - Bee: I have Shirly Aunty's recipe
07/08/2020, 17:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 17:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Na not biryani. I'll go with chicken curry for now and we'll see what next
07/08/2020, 17:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Okay
07/08/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh that sounds good 😮. The biryani you had today was my mom's recipe?
07/08/2020, 17:54 - Bee: No it was my mother's. But now that I'm going through Shirly Aunty's I think it's similar. Just the order of masalas is different
07/08/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... I don't know a lot about Biryanis. Does that make a difference?
07/08/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I don't know a lot about biryanis either 🤷🏽‍♀️
07/08/2020, 17:56 - Bee: Is the curry for tonight?
07/08/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I didn't buy chicken today either. Just sausages. Chicken is for next time
07/08/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sleeping early tonight?
07/08/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Bb
07/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Okay
07/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Nahh I'm not sleepy
07/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: I'll sleep in an hour
07/08/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Bible study may be postponed to tomorrow. Something came up for Paddy
07/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Oh
07/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: All okay
07/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Can we talk then? Nothing in particular. Just because
07/08/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yea yea. He had to go out with his dad
07/08/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: I hope to too. They haven't decided yet. Wait, are you free now?
07/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Ahhhhhh
07/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: I'll be free in 15
07/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Let me know whenever you find out
07/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: If I'm up, we'll talk?
07/08/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! I'd love to be on a call then. If they message and say we're meeting today then we can end at 8
07/08/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Okay
07/08/2020, 19:00 - Bee: :)))
07/08/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're free
07/08/2020, 19:12 - Bee: I will
07/08/2020, 19:20 - Bee: Nischal. Jason just came home. It's going to be a while until I can talk
07/08/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: No problem. If I have my Bible study we can just talk tomorrow 😊
07/08/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Or if it gets too late we can still talk tomorrow 😁
07/08/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Okay. I think it'll be too late for tonight. We're all sitting together and Jason is giving us a rundown of everything that happened. Priya's parents invited him home and all that so
07/08/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice! Yea Debby I think you should be in that conversation too. Today was meant to be an off day for calls anyway 😂
07/08/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Fiiiiiiiiinnneeee.
07/08/2020, 19:25 - Bee: I'm imagining how it's going to be when one of us (or both) is/are busy again and we won't get to talk so often
07/08/2020, 19:25 - Bee: It's okay. We'll cross that bridge when it comes
07/08/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: That's the bridge we were at for so many months though. We talk when we can and we won't talk when we can't. I'll just have to look forward to the next opportunity we do
07/08/2020, 19:29 - Bee: Yes. But that's a bridge I don't like being at
07/08/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Don't mind me complaining
07/08/2020, 19:31 - Bee: It's my usual
07/08/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: I know. Present suffering for future glory is what I tell myself in a very small context here. I try to find comfort in knowing that we will have many moments of togetherness on the next bridge
07/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: There's so much to look forward to.
07/08/2020, 19:41 - Bee: I'm reminded of the quote by Jim Elliot
Let not our longing slay the appetite of our living.
We're in beautiful places rn and must cherish them too. I'm telling this more to myself than I am to you
07/08/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: How true. I like the reminder. I guess I forget it too often as well
07/08/2020, 19:47 - Bee: I'm going to read a bit and then go to sleep
07/08/2020, 19:48 - Bee: NISCHAL
HOW'S PEA FOR A NICKNAME 😂
07/08/2020, 19:48 - Bee: Nahh.
07/08/2020, 19:48 - Bee: I'll think of another vegetable
07/08/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Enjoy your reading 😊. Pea said out loud might be misunderstood...
07/08/2020, 19:49 - Bee: OH yes. Definitely not pea then 😁
07/08/2020, 19:49 - Bee: 😂*
07/08/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
07/08/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Nischal so funny
07/08/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: I mean I won't stop you if you really want to. But I think it'll take a lot of explaining and that's a lot of effort
07/08/2020, 19:50 - Bee: What are you typing for so long
07/08/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Yeah. Or I can just say there's a loonng story behind it and leave it at that
07/08/2020, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: 😬
07/08/2020, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 19:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's the face people will have when you say it's a long story
07/08/2020, 20:00 - Bee: Hmm. Pea is not an option then. I can never match or even come close to the sentiment and thought that you've put into the name you've given me :O
07/08/2020, 20:00 - Bee: Bible study time?
07/08/2020, 20:01 - Bee: Goodnight, beloved. Talk to you tomorrow! 😊
07/08/2020, 20:02 - Nischal Abraham: Bible study may or may not start at 8:45. Goodnight Bee! You picked the name yourself though 😮
07/08/2020, 20:03 - Bee: I gave myself the name bee?
07/08/2020, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: It's what your name means right?
07/08/2020, 20:05 - Bee: Yes
07/08/2020, 20:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well either way even if you called me by no name I'd still know the sentiment behind it ☺️
07/08/2020, 20:06 - Bee: Okay, by no name 😁
07/08/2020, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: Byee. (I hope that's what you meant)
07/08/2020, 20:08 - Bee: No. You said I'd I called you by no name you'd still know the sentiment behind it
07/08/2020, 20:08 - Bee: So I'm calling you 'by no name'
07/08/2020, 20:08 - Bee: If*
07/08/2020, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: 😶. Dad joke!
07/08/2020, 20:10 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/08/2020, 20:11 - Bee: Bye. 😊
07/08/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
08/08/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Helllooooooooooo
08/08/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Deep cleaning the kitchen today
08/08/2020, 08:56 - Bee: It's fun when there's music
08/08/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Boring otherwise
08/08/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Good morning!
08/08/2020, 09:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/08/2020, 10:00 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Thank you for the box. I'll probably look into getting myself a pair as well
08/08/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a wonderful day Debby! I wonder if you've managed to cooperate with Ashley this time 😂
08/08/2020, 14:25 - Bee: Brb
08/08/2020, 14:42 - Bee: Hi Nischal 😊
08/08/2020, 14:43 - Bee: I was at the hospital. Usha Bhatnagar aunty (we visited her last year after Philip uncle's birthday cake cutting thing) is admitted. She underwent an appendectomy. She has a caretaker but she wanted to take some rest so I went there for a few hours. Just got back
08/08/2020, 14:43 - Bee: I left from home just as you messaged but I don't have a data pack so I couldn't reply
08/08/2020, 14:43 - Bee: How's your day going?
08/08/2020, 14:44 - Bee: Would you be free for a call?
08/08/2020, 14:44 - Bee: Tonight
08/08/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Waaaiiiitt you're speaking tomorrow
08/08/2020, 15:05 - Bee: We will talk tomorrow then. If you're free
08/08/2020, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you've had a busy day. I'd actually like it if we got on a call today. There's some things on my mind and it'd be nice to talk things out
08/08/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: I probably won't stay on the call for too long. Tomorrow is Sunday anyway so that should work out as a good thing for both of us
08/08/2020, 15:27 - Bee: Sure. Tonight it is. I'll let you know how long I'll need around 11
08/08/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it 😊
08/08/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
08/08/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Hi
08/08/2020, 18:45 - Bee: In 15?
08/08/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Okay :)
08/08/2020, 18:45 - Bee: :)
08/08/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Hey
08/08/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
08/08/2020, 19:05 - Bee: I'll call?
08/08/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
09/08/2020, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I hope you had a blessed morning. Did you manage to attend the worship meeting from the hospital?
09/08/2020, 12:02 - Bee: Good afternoon, Nischal!!!! ☺️
09/08/2020, 12:02 - Bee: I did. But not continuously...
09/08/2020, 12:03 - Bee: Usha aunty told me to get the uke and play it here tomorrow. But I don't know how to play any Hindi hymns
09/08/2020, 12:04 - Bee: How's your day going?
09/08/2020, 12:49 - Nischal Abraham: Worship was good 😊. I finally ended up sharing on Lamentations 3 but it was a good time. Making veg fried rice for lunch now
09/08/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Ohh. Why veg??!!
09/08/2020, 13:58 - Bee: How is it?
09/08/2020, 14:07 - Bee: We're going for a drive!!! Byyyeee
09/08/2020, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: I was on a long call with dad. Veg cause I had a bunch of vegetables in the fridge
09/08/2020, 15:57 - Bee: Ahh
09/08/2020, 15:57 - Bee: When are you leaving for rock climbing?
09/08/2020, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Won't be going climbing today. My county is in lockdown ☹️
09/08/2020, 16:27 - Bee: :( how come? Has there been a rise in cases?
09/08/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. So I can't leave the county for the next two weeks at least. Fortunately the Bible study is happening over zoom so I can still be a part of that
09/08/2020, 16:30 - Bee: Oh. Is Daniel from the same county is you?
09/08/2020, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. He's closer to Dublin city
09/08/2020, 16:31 - Bee: Oh. So you can't go to his place either :(
09/08/2020, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: No :(. I'll have to enjoy a lot more alone time
09/08/2020, 16:40 - Bee: Yep. Doing all the things you haven't been able to so far
09/08/2020, 16:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'll get to talk to you lot more often
09/08/2020, 16:57 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/08/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Not that I want you to be cooped up at home. But since it also means we get to talk more, that's my reaction.
09/08/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. I can't even begin to imagine you actually do that
09/08/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I did it in my head. If I was by myself, I would've definitely done it out loud.
09/08/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Right. So how's the rest of your day been? How was the drive?
09/08/2020, 17:31 - Bee: It was alright. Nothing unusual. The drive was 🥰.  I enjoy driving ya.
09/08/2020, 17:31 - Bee: How's your day going?
09/08/2020, 17:31 - Bee: I'm going to the hospital tomorrow also. Usha aunty is doing much better today. Eating more, talking more
09/08/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: That's good! So playing the Uke tomorrow?
09/08/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Nah I think I'll give her another day of peace. I'll play it day after
09/08/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's been good! A lot of time spent on phonecalls so now I'm watching random videos
09/08/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's a chilly day today. I just want to be wrapped up in my blanket
09/08/2020, 17:33 - Bee: It is Siby Aunty's birthday today. I'm sure you know. But just in case
09/08/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: And I feel a bit drained and tired
09/08/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: My dad told me. I wished her
09/08/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Oh. What's stopping you?
09/08/2020, 17:34 - Bee: How come?
09/08/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Did you sleep okay?
09/08/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: I did get up early to prepare for the message. Maybe that's why... 6:30 is new for me
09/08/2020, 17:59 - Bee: And the night before you slept at 3
09/08/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes that too. It all makes sense now 😂
09/08/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Yep. What time is Bible study? Tonight's going to be a late night too!
09/08/2020, 18:01 - Bee: But you're home tomorrow right?
09/08/2020, 18:01 - Bee: So you can rest
09/08/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I can't go anywhere. But it's a nice kind of tired. And it's the perfect weather to be wrapped up in my blanket ☺️
09/08/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: What time are you going to bed?
09/08/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Like a burrito?
09/08/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Have you seen burrito blankets?
09/08/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Probably in two more hours
09/08/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Is that a thing? I thought it's just when your wrap yourself up in a normal blanket
09/08/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Wait
09/08/2020, 18:09 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/08/2020, 18:09 - Bee: That is a thing
09/08/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Oh noooo. It literally looks like a chapatti 🤣
09/08/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Can you eat it?
09/08/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Aren't burrito and tortilla wraps fancy chapatis
09/08/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Sadly, no.
09/08/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep they are. I prefer my non food looking blanket though
09/08/2020, 18:13 - Bee: It'll be nice to have a burrito blanket tho. I'll look like a snack. Literally
09/08/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Why tho?
09/08/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Why what?
09/08/2020, 18:17 - Bee: I can't find the For a friend playlist in my library Nischal
09/08/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Can you send the link to the playlist please
09/08/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Because I am a snack
09/08/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: What do you mean by that?
09/08/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Here’s a playlist for you… For A Friend by Nischal
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1B9hvONtn0YaBA22VJQRUM?si=AmfjkNo8THqvNGJH7L91Gw
09/08/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Thank you nana
09/08/2020, 18:32 - Bee: You know it
09/08/2020, 18:32 - Bee: 😒
09/08/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe I don't. I need a detailed 300 word explanation
09/08/2020, 18:36 - Bee: I'll give it to you after you've delivered your 27 minute lecture on RGB
09/08/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. That's gonna take forever to happen 😕
09/08/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Aww. I'll have more time to prepare
09/08/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: So it is a super complicated thing to understand then!
09/08/2020, 18:49 - Bee: No it's not. It's so easy that I don't need 300 words. Not even 20 words. And that's why I want time to prepare
09/08/2020, 18:50 - Bee: What time is Bible study?
09/08/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: At 8pm as usual. You needing time to prepare makes no sense
09/08/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: If I didn't know any better it sounds like you don't really know what it means either 🤔
09/08/2020, 18:54 - Bee: So you do know better
09/08/2020, 18:54 - Bee: You know what it means
09/08/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Okay
09/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: I don't really
09/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: We had this conversation once after the gospel meeting. Nikhil was visiting. Around that time. And you knew what it meant
09/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: I remember the exact conversation
09/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/08/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Well maybe my definition is entirely incorrect 😑
09/08/2020, 19:03 - Bee: No. You told me your definition and it was correct. And I was surprised that you knew
09/08/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: 😑😑😑😑😑
09/08/2020, 19:04 - Bee: .
09/08/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Fine fine. Don't tell me what you mean by it. I'll just "assume" and hope it's right
09/08/2020, 19:05 - Bee: What's your assumption?
09/08/2020, 19:05 - Bee: I don't mind telling you but I don't have 300 words
09/08/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: It was an exaggeration!
09/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: OH
09/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Since you're wrapped in a burrito you are now food
09/08/2020, 19:11 - Bee: A snack is someone who is extremely attractive. (Maybe like your favorite snack (food) which you can gobble right up)
09/08/2020, 19:11 - Bee: 😒
09/08/2020, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: I just thought of a really funny scenario where I could tag the Instagram post right here with your comment of calling yourself a snack
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Which Instagram post?
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: The one I sent?
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: I don't understand
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Explain Nischal
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Nischal
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Nischal
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Nischal
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Explain
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Explain
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: You know it
09/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Tell me
09/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: This.
09/08/2020, 19:16 - Bee: I don't!!!
09/08/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: You're turning Super Saiyan?
09/08/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: That's pretty dope
09/08/2020, 19:16 - Bee: I'm proud of myself for thinking of this gif and actually finding it
09/08/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Yes
09/08/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Thanks
09/08/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Ashley forcing me to watch DBZ wasn't useless after all
09/08/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Have you eaten dinner?
09/08/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: What I mean is you calling yourself a snack sounds quite vain no? I'd use the comment of not having to worry about other guys because of it
09/08/2020, 19:18 - Bee: Not having to worry about other guys because I'm calling myself a snack?
09/08/2020, 19:18 - Bee: Also, you're calling me vain???!!!!!!!!!!!
09/08/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. It used to be such a big show back in the day
09/08/2020, 19:18 - Bee: One I didn't enjoy
09/08/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Uff I'm bad at setting the pace for jokes. And it's even worse on text. Remind me next time we talk and I'll say it out. Hopefully then it lands 😶
09/08/2020, 19:20 - Bee: Only if you say Uff when we talk
09/08/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: What? 😂
09/08/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Sure
09/08/2020, 19:23 - Bee: The uff here. Say it on a call
09/08/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Okay
09/08/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: My exclamation wasn't a lack of understanding what you said but why you said it
09/08/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... I don't want to ruin your usage of snack so maybe I'll keep my interpretation of it to myself
09/08/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Oh. Because I think it'll sound cute
09/08/2020, 19:24 - Bee: What's your interpretation?
09/08/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe it's all in my head, but it just seems to have the same vibe as calling someone sexy
09/08/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Oh. No I've read sentences with this usage too
09/08/2020, 19:28 - Bee: That's why whole meal >>>>>> snack
09/08/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Which usage? The one I mentioned or you mentioned?
09/08/2020, 19:29 - Bee: The one you mentioned
09/08/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: I don't get this either 😂
09/08/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Are you agreeing with me here?
09/08/2020, 19:30 - Bee: Oh Nischal. There so much you have to learn.
09/08/2020, 19:30 - Bee: Where? Your usage?
09/08/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so confused. You started with no and then referenced what I said
09/08/2020, 19:30 - Bee: The one you mentioned*
09/08/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you're disagreeing here
09/08/2020, 19:31 - Bee: No, it's not all I'm your head, I've read sentences with this usage too
09/08/2020, 19:31 - Bee: In* 🤦🏽‍♀️
09/08/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Did you get it?
09/08/2020, 19:32 - Bee: This usage = the one you mentioned
09/08/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I think so. I'll leave it at whatever I got. We're just going in circles
09/08/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Okay
09/08/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Yea anyway. My point is I'm not too fond of using the phrase of calling someone a snack myself
09/08/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Okay
09/08/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Then don't call anyone a snack
09/08/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Nischal. I just realized we could've talked for all this time instead of all the texting
09/08/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: That's a nice solution 😂. I should've thought of that ine6
09/08/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: One*
09/08/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Assuming you were free
09/08/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: I was. Still am
09/08/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Have you eaten dinner yet?
09/08/2020, 19:35 - Bee: I know I asked you before but I don't remember if you answered
09/08/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: No... There's guests downstairs
09/08/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Oh
09/08/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Are they from the same county? 🤔
09/08/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: I guess? I haven't gone down to confirm their location 😅
09/08/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Okay. You're eating after the Bible study then?
09/08/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: If I'm not too tired then. Else it's a fasting for dinner day today. I'll probably eat at least a banana. Or toast some bread and have it with butter and jam
09/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Okay
09/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Would you like to get on a call? For 20 minutes
09/08/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
10/08/2020, 08:18 - Bee: I FINISHED CHAPTER TWO
10/08/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: CONGRATULATIONS!!
10/08/2020, 09:55 - Bee: Thank you!!
10/08/2020, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your time in the hospital today 😊. I got up very late so I'm just heading down to have breakfast now
10/08/2020, 10:18 - Bee: I will 😁 it feels like I'm working as a nurse but I have only one patient and I can sit whenever I want to. And pee whenever I want to.
10/08/2020, 10:18 - Bee: Spending my time proofreading Reenee's assignments
10/08/2020, 10:19 - Bee: I hope you have a great day. ☺️
10/08/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't a nurse for one patient like a home nurse?
10/08/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I hope you do too!
10/08/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Yes
10/08/2020, 12:32 - Bee: I had breakfast here 😌
10/08/2020, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's good 😂. No starving today
10/08/2020, 13:57 - Bee: But I ate some at home before leaving. My mother will never let me leave the house without breakfast
10/08/2020, 13:57 - Bee: I'm back home!!
10/08/2020, 13:57 - Bee: How's your day been so far?
10/08/2020, 13:57 - Bee: Are you going to experiment with food today?
10/08/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: No experiment today. Today is a 2 meal day so it's just eat very heavy meals at odd times
10/08/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: I just got off the call with Siby aunty. It's been a long while since I've spoken to her
10/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Why two meals? You had breakfast and lunch. No dinner today?
10/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Oh. I just got off a call with AAA. It is Ashish's birthday today
10/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/08/2020, 16:03 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/08/2020, 16:04 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/08/2020, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Aww sounds like a lovely call ☺️
10/08/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: I had brunch. And then I'll have dinner
10/08/2020, 16:21 - Bee: Ah
10/08/2020, 16:21 - Bee: Call tonight?
10/08/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free for one right now
10/08/2020, 18:32 - Bee: I'm still not free :(
10/08/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Will you be free in 20?
10/08/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Yep yep. Just let me know when
10/08/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free anytime from now
10/08/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Okay.
10/08/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Hi
10/08/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Missed voice call
10/08/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
10/08/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I'll call?
10/08/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
11/08/2020, 10:12 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! How's your day been? Looking forward to hearing that your ukulele playing was wonderful 😁
11/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Hi Nischal!
As I was about to leave for the hospital, Keerti aunty (Usha Aunty's niece) called me up and told me that I don't have to go today because she's getting discharged. I was looking forward to seeing her :(. So there was no ukulele playing. Which worked out perfectly because I've been down with fever since morning :(. I got a little wet in the rain yesterday  but it wasn't much ya. Only on my way to the hospital gate from the hospitals entrance
11/08/2020, 10:56 - Bee: I've been resting the whole day. Took a paracetamol after lunch and I'm feeling better
11/08/2020, 10:57 - Bee: I hope it's nothing
11/08/2020, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: Good to hear she's getting discharged. Praying for you Debby! Just rest well and stay hydrated. I hope it's nothing too ☹️
11/08/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Yes I've been drinking a lot of warm water but it still doesn't feel like enough
11/08/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Hi Nischal :/
11/08/2020, 17:16 - Bee: No
11/08/2020, 17:16 - Bee: :)*
11/08/2020, 17:16 - Bee: How's your day going?
11/08/2020, 17:16 - Bee: But my insides feel like this
11/08/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Do you still have fever? Has it gotten worse?
11/08/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: My day's not been too great but that's my own doing. Just spent all my day in bed other than eating. It's another cloudy/rainy day and it makes me feel lazy every time
11/08/2020, 18:29 - Bee: There's a few more hours in the day. Redeem your time, Nischal. What did you plan on doing today?
11/08/2020, 18:32 - Bee: I took a nap in the afternoon and was feeling better, but it's worse now. My body is aching. I inhaled steam, had chicken soup for dinner (always works on my fever), and took another paracetamol. Let's see if I'm better tomorrow
11/08/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Rest rest. It's true there is more time in the day. I didn't have anything particular in mind but not doing anything feels like a waste
11/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Praying you will get better Bee! Any chances it might be covid?
11/08/2020, 19:35 - Bee: The symptoms I have are classic for covid. There are chances
11/08/2020, 19:36 - Bee: I'm gonna go to sleep
11/08/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. ☺️
11/08/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Hope you feel better tomorrow 🥺
11/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: I hope so too
11/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Bye!
11/08/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: Byee!
11/08/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: ☺️
12/08/2020, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! How are you feeling?
12/08/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Hi Nischal :)
12/08/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Feeling the same as last night
12/08/2020, 11:24 - Bee: How's your day going?
12/08/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Any plans? Other than Bible study in the evening
12/08/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be going shopping in the afternoon. But other than that nothing really planned
12/08/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Do you need to get a check up done at the doc?
12/08/2020, 12:39 - Bee: I'll go tomorrow if it persists. Because it might just be viral fever
12/08/2020, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Covid is a viral fever 😅. I'm sure you'll make the right call. I'm just worried about you Bee
12/08/2020, 13:02 - Nischal Abraham: Rest plenty! You don't have to reply to my messages. I'll keep updating you on things happening and you can just reply whenever you're feeling up to it 😊
12/08/2020, 15:17 - Bee: Nooo the common cold kinda viral fever
12/08/2020, 15:17 - Bee: I will go tomorrow. Pakka
12/08/2020, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: Don't go if you're feeling better. I came back from shopping. Bought beef mince and I'm attempting a thing. Will let you know how it turns out 😅
12/08/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Oh wow. What are you making??!!!
12/08/2020, 16:47 - Bee: I'll have to go tomorrow
12/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Modifying a recipe my mom sent for beef and carrots
12/08/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: If looks very sad but tastes alright so that's a win in my books. I'll take a pic when I'm eating dinner
12/08/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: I really hope it's nothing serious. Are you still feeling low right now?
12/08/2020, 18:10 - Bee: As long as it tastes good. You're meal prepping?! Isn't that when you cook beforehand? Have you cooked for more than one meal? Because I think that's a requirement. I don't know man
12/08/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Yep feeling the same
12/08/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: ☹️
12/08/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Meal prepping is when you prepare the ingredients beforehand
12/08/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: I have cooked for more than one meal since I don't want to leave raw meat in the fridge so I just cook all of it in one go
12/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Nooo meal prepping is when you prepare meals for more than a day beforehand
12/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: ☹️
12/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
12/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yeah! That makes more sense
12/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Porottaaaaaa
12/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: This looks yum!
12/08/2020, 18:59 - Bee: 👏🏽
12/08/2020, 19:01 - Bee: I hope you've had a good day so far, Nischal 😊. I miss talking to you. And also all of the wonderful things I could've been doing had I not been sick. Enjoy dinner and Bible study
12/08/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Goodnight :)
12/08/2020, 19:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/08/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! There'll always be time for us to talk. You rest up and get better ☺️
12/08/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I hope Bible study is good. Dinner was nice 😋
12/08/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: 😊
12/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: ☺️
12/08/2020, 22:41 - Bee: Hi
12/08/2020, 22:47 - Bee: Fine you're asleep
12/08/2020, 22:47 - Bee: Just checking
13/08/2020, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! I switched off my screens early yesterday. Finished reading the John Piper book finally 😁. And I was just praying at night
13/08/2020, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: How are you feeling today? Did you go see the doctor yet or is that later?
13/08/2020, 08:21 - Bee: Hi Nischal!
13/08/2020, 08:21 - Bee: You finished a book!! Yay!
13/08/2020, 08:23 - Bee: I'm feeling much better today. No fever or bodyache. It's just sinusitis now. The kind I get once every monsoon. So my head feels heavy, sinuses are clogged, I have a runny nose. But no fever!!!! I've been up and about the most today compared to the last few days.
13/08/2020, 08:23 - Bee: Thank you for praying, Nischal
13/08/2020, 08:23 - Bee: Haven't gone yet. The doctor I want to see is available in the evening. Will go then
13/08/2020, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: So glad to hear you're doing better! Continuing to pray that you are fully well ☺️
13/08/2020, 08:31 - Nischal Abraham: Mat 10:28-31
28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Aren’t two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will. 30 Even all the hairs on your head are numbered. 31 So do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.
13/08/2020, 08:32 - Nischal Abraham: That was part of my morning reading today
13/08/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Reminds me of the song Do not worry by Ellie Holcomb
13/08/2020, 12:19 - Bee: I'm still feeling better. I thought I would go back to yesterday's state by evening
13/08/2020, 12:20 - Bee: Really grateful to God. Just praying that the rest of the fam doesn't fall sick
13/08/2020, 12:20 - Bee: How's your day going?
13/08/2020, 12:20 - Bee: What's for lunch?
13/08/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been alright so far. I'll make some rice and boil up some carrots and brocolli. Then there's my mince from yesterday
13/08/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: Are you quarantining yourself in the house?
13/08/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Yep. Keeping to myself
13/08/2020, 13:08 - Bee: I'm going to try making Mysore pak now
13/08/2020, 13:08 - Bee: I want to make chicken puffs also. But on a day when I'm feeling complete okay because there's a lot of work in that
13/08/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Mysore pak looks easy
13/08/2020, 13:09 - Bee: Rice with two side dishes??!! Nice
13/08/2020, 14:36 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 14:36 - Bee: I got my prescription
13/08/2020, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: That looks super sweet. Which is the goal I guess 😂
13/08/2020, 14:40 - Nischal Abraham: You must be feeling better if you're making stuff in the kitchen. Was your prescription Mysore Pak?
13/08/2020, 14:44 - Bee: It would be super sweet for you 😂
13/08/2020, 14:45 - Bee: Nope but I might as well call it my prescription because I'm feeling alright after eating some 😂
13/08/2020, 14:46 - Bee: I had an online consultation with the doctor. That's a thing now. He told me I can take the meds I usually take when I have sinusitis
13/08/2020, 14:47 - Nischal Abraham: That's good!
13/08/2020, 14:48 - Nischal Abraham: Interesting... If you're getting better then any consultation is good right?
13/08/2020, 14:55 - Bee: It is
13/08/2020, 14:55 - Bee: I'm feeling much much better Nischal
13/08/2020, 14:55 - Bee: I was so worried
13/08/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: I was too! Thanking God for your recovery 😊
13/08/2020, 16:13 - Bee: ☺️
13/08/2020, 16:13 - Bee: X 10!!!!!
13/08/2020, 16:33 - Nischal Abraham: It was lovely seeing you at the Bible study
13/08/2020, 17:37 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 17:38 - Bee: I didn't see you
13/08/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Why
13/08/2020, 17:38 - Bee: WHY?!?!
13/08/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Will you do something for me Nischal
13/08/2020, 17:39 - Bee: It is against your instincts and not something you do
13/08/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Will you send a photo of yourself 😋
13/08/2020, 17:39 - Bee: OR I'll see you whenever I see you
13/08/2020, 17:40 - Bee: I introduced Jason to Pinterest
13/08/2020, 17:40 - Bee: He has already started pinning
13/08/2020, 17:41 - Bee: How's your day going?
13/08/2020, 17:41 - Bee: How are you, Nischal? I haven't asked you
13/08/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Is it okay if we just video call next time we talk?
13/08/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Yes it is
13/08/2020, 17:42 - Bee: And we can switch back to audio call when it gets awkward
13/08/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well. Day's been pretty uneventful and I'm not particularly pushed to do anything
13/08/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: It won't get awkward. I think we're past the awkward video call phase. But it would be easier for you to hear me if it were an audio call
13/08/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: I think you've asked me this twice before already so it's not that you haven't asked me 😂
13/08/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going?
13/08/2020, 17:43 - Bee: That's why I didn't mention here that I haven't asked you no
13/08/2020, 17:44 - Bee: What ya bbbbbbbbbbbbbb
13/08/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Oh technicalities
13/08/2020, 17:44 - Bee: Seems like you're challenging me
13/08/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: To hear me in a video call? I don't have a earphone with a mic so it'll be loudspeaker voice is all
13/08/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Nope. To make it awkward on a video call
13/08/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. What if I never feel awkward though?
13/08/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Are all those fedoras yours?
13/08/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Which ones the Singapore one?
13/08/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Wait I'll guess
13/08/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Except for 1 I think
13/08/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: That's our group singing group. We won first place!
13/08/2020, 17:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. It's second from the right
13/08/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Oh
13/08/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Who is the girl with the red fedora? She looks like a schoolmate of mine
13/08/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Are you wearing football studs?
13/08/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Her name's Riya Joy. She was a second year in my final year I think
13/08/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Ah no. Those were football turf shoes that I wore all the time. It was the only pair of casual shoes I had
13/08/2020, 18:03 - Bee: HEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY we went to the same school!!!!!
13/08/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: OHH! Someone you know?
13/08/2020, 18:03 - Bee: And were in the same class in the 10th I think
13/08/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Yes
13/08/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Riya Joy
13/08/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's interesting! She sings very well. I only knew her because of the competitions
13/08/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Football turf shoes and football studs are different? I didn't know that. Are the one with spikes called spikes?
13/08/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: Studs have the protrusions, spikes have spikes, and turf shoes are flat
13/08/2020, 18:26 - Bee: OH
13/08/2020, 18:27 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 18:28 - Bee: I don't remember if I've heard her sing
13/08/2020, 18:28 - Bee: We were okay friends back then
13/08/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
13/08/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: There was one with our medals though I can't seem to find that now 😐
13/08/2020, 18:30 - Bee: Each one of you got medals?
13/08/2020, 18:31 - Bee: Did y'all sing in this attire too or just took a group photo?
13/08/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: This was our singing attire
13/08/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: We just took a group pic on traditional day
13/08/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well we got a certificate and a trophy for the group singing. But that's a medal in our hearts 😂
13/08/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Oh
13/08/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Yes I thought so. White and blue
13/08/2020, 18:46 - Bee: All matchy matchy
13/08/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Wheres the duet and solo singing photos
13/08/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: I've been looking for them but can't find it 😞. Stumbled on all these other photos along the way
13/08/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: It's probably in my WhatsApp backup. But that's a mess to go through. I need to add sorting that to list of things to get done
13/08/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Oh. Taking a trip down memory lane? It never ends!!
13/08/2020, 18:52 - Bee: The lane I mean. The lane never ends
13/08/2020, 18:52 - Bee: How do you sort through WhatsApp backup?
13/08/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Or do you mean you've saved all WhatsApp media someplace?
13/08/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Save the important photos and never look at the rest 😂
13/08/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: It doesn't! I did that 2 days back I think and it just kept going on and on so I had to stop myself
13/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Ahhh. I keep almost everything thinking that I'll like to look back years down the line
13/08/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yea but it's been a few years and most WhatsApp images are just memes 😞
13/08/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Not going to bed?
13/08/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Oh. I delete memes and such before backing up
13/08/2020, 19:10 - Bee: I am. In 10 minutes Nischal
13/08/2020, 19:10 - Bee: What are you doing?
13/08/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Ohhhhhh because of the phone call?
13/08/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: I started watching Cobra Kai season 2
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Seeeee so many good things came out of it
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: But I'll probably head downstairs for some dinner in half an hour
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Is that anime? You mentioned that you started a series
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: There's too many! I just copy paste everything
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: No no. That's a TV show. Have you ever watched a movie called Karate Kid?
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: It's a spin-off of that
13/08/2020, 19:11 - Bee: I have
13/08/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Oh
13/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: There was another anime I was watching but I finished one season and I'm taking it slow so not starting the next one yet
13/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: What're you doing?
13/08/2020, 19:16 - Bee: I am reading Reddit thread on Instagram
13/08/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Threads
13/08/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: What? 😂
13/08/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Why not just read them on Reddit?
13/08/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: What's the gossip?
13/08/2020, 19:17 - Bee: 😂
13/08/2020, 19:17 - Bee: I don't have a Reddit account
13/08/2020, 19:18 - Bee: There's gossip on Reddit?!
13/08/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't that the point of Reddit? Well anyway my point was what's the thread about?

13/08/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: It's good to learn something
13/08/2020, 19:25 - Bee: But not today
13/08/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: I learnt that taking two things when leaving the room will help me keep it clean!
13/08/2020, 19:25 - Bee: I'll tell you something be tomorrow
13/08/2020, 19:26 - Bee: New*
13/08/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Good. I've never done that
13/08/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Or thought of cleaning like that rather
13/08/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep me neither. Lpt coming clutch
13/08/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Though some of the tips are just dumb 😂
13/08/2020, 19:28 - Bee: What is lpt coming clutch?
13/08/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Is that a thing? Or a statement you're making which I don't understand
13/08/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Like?
13/08/2020, 19:28 - Bee: I'm going to sleep

13/08/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Bread and eggs
13/08/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: The subreddit is helping out in a desperate situation(which is an exaggeration but its a phrase)
13/08/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
13/08/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you feel x100 better tomorrow. Praying for you constantly 😊

13/08/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Goodnight!
13/08/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too 🥺
13/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: I think this is the first time you've time me this on text
13/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Told*
13/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Starred, obv
13/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Bye :)
13/08/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Oh no wait
13/08/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Not the first time
13/08/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Oops
13/08/2020, 19:40 - Bee: But it felt like the first time
13/08/2020, 19:40 - Bee: I don't know why
13/08/2020, 19:45 - Bee: I started reading old messages 🤦🏽‍♀️
13/08/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Bye
13/08/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Which brought up a question in my mind. I will ask you whenever we talk next
13/08/2020, 19:49 - Bee: Bye
13/08/2020, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: Write down the question! I went to have dinner. Memory lane is a fun one to go down. We should do that together one day
14/08/2020, 07:50 - Bee: Written it down
14/08/2020, 07:51 - Bee: Go down which lane? Text messages?!
14/08/2020, 07:51 - Bee: Im feeling almost okay now Nischal
14/08/2020, 07:51 - Bee: My head is a bit heavy but thats all. Ive got it easy now
14/08/2020, 07:54 - Bee: But my grandmother is feeling feverish now :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
14/08/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: I just said _memory_ lane 😅
14/08/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: That's good news
14/08/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: That's not good news. Praying for your grandmother!
14/08/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Yes yes I understood that. Buuuuut, your own memory lane? Or my memory lane? Or the memory lane pertaining to us? Because if it's the last, the only documented memories are text messages. That's why I was asking
14/08/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Good morning, Nischallllllll
14/08/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: I meant all memory lanes. In a very general sense. And good afternoon to you Debby 😊
14/08/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Ahhhh. Cool cool cool
14/08/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the day? Still resting?
14/08/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Yes, still resting. I thought I would go to the RTO to set up a date for my driver's license test. Ayyyyy even though my learner's expired in May, I can still give the test. Because pandemic and all. 
But it's raining heavily. And my head still feels heavy. So I'll tomorrow or on Monday instead
14/08/2020, 10:59 - Bee: No other plans
14/08/2020, 11:00 - Bee: Going to be on a call with Reenee and Berachah around 7ish. Just to talk and pray about the girls group that we have here. Berachah is added too
14/08/2020, 11:00 - Bee: Nothing else
14/08/2020, 11:00 - Bee: What're your plans for today?
14/08/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Get some coding tasks done. Update my GitHub and LinkedIn for job stuff.
14/08/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Not waste all my time in YouTube or start a new TV show
14/08/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: Fold up my clothes. Exercise a bit in the evening
14/08/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome you can still give the test! Have things opened up for you to get a date yet?
14/08/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds nice!
14/08/2020, 11:09 - Nischal Abraham: Which reminds me, do you know berachah's insta handle. See I've been wanting to watch these singing sessions you mentioned but I haven't found her on the app 😞
14/08/2020, 11:28 - Bee: Yes the RTO is open. I called and they said there are slots available on the 21st
14/08/2020, 11:34 - Bee: I shared the profile on Instagram
14/08/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: So soon! 😮. Nice!
14/08/2020, 11:35 - Bee: She has no fixed schedule for lives tho
14/08/2020, 11:35 - Bee: Yes!! 🤩
14/08/2020, 11:37 - Bee: I want to take a nap Nischal
14/08/2020, 11:37 - Bee: The pills are making me drowsy
14/08/2020, 11:37 - Nischal Abraham: What's stopping you?
14/08/2020, 11:37 - Bee: Nothing
14/08/2020, 11:37 - Bee: Bye
14/08/2020, 11:37 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your nap 😊
14/08/2020, 11:38 - Nischal Abraham: Talk later. If you're up to it could we hop on a call tonight? We can skip if you don't want to
14/08/2020, 11:38 - Bee: Yes yes yes yes
14/08/2020, 11:39 - Bee: :))))
14/08/2020, 11:39 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Sleep well
14/08/2020, 11:39 - Bee: I'll let you know the time later?
14/08/2020, 11:39 - Bee: 11ish?
14/08/2020, 11:40 - Bee: Yep. Bye
14/08/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Whenever you're free. I'll have an early dinner as well
14/08/2020, 11:40 - Bee: Okay
14/08/2020, 14:59 - Bee: I slept a bit. Ashley was on a work call and was too loud :(
14/08/2020, 14:59 - Bee: Now I've got the family zoom meet
14/08/2020, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy the meeting! And your call with the girls. I had a long call with my dad too
14/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Ooh. That's nice
14/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: What's up?
14/08/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Not a lot. I'll have dinner in an hour. How was your call?
14/08/2020, 17:31 - Bee: It was lovely. Didn't talk much, just prayed about the girls group and what to do next... Wasn't a long call because I had the family thing
14/08/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. How are you feeling now? Head still heavy?
14/08/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Almost alright. I could help with the chores today which I couldn't the last three days. Slightly heavy. But nothing compared to how it was
14/08/2020, 18:04 - Bee: This message was deleted
14/08/2020, 18:05 - Bee: :)
14/08/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! Well I'm heading down to have dinner. Talk to you soon ☺️
14/08/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Okay. Looking forward to it :))
14/08/2020, 18:33 - Bee: I'll be free in 15. You take your time. I'll be here
14/08/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
14/08/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Done with dinner
14/08/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Was it 15 min?
14/08/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: 15 sec?
14/08/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: 15 hours?

14/08/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Well it can't be 15 sec anymore
14/08/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Or did you mean 15 sec and I was too late!! 😱
14/08/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Noooooooo
14/08/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free anytime you are now Bee. Just waiting for your reply
14/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: NISCHALLLLLLLLL
14/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: What comes after millennia?
14/08/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know
14/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: WHY WOULD I WAIT THAT LONG ANYWAY
14/08/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Not in my head anyway. I'd have to Google it up
14/08/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'll only sleep in an hour or 2. Will read some
14/08/2020, 21:18 - Bee: My phone died immediately after Goodnight!!!
14/08/2020, 21:19 - Bee: Okay. I'll sleep now
14/08/2020, 21:19 - Bee: Bye. :))
14/08/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Perfect timing on the bye 😊
15/08/2020, 08:18 - Bee: NISCHAL!!
15/08/2020, 08:18 - Bee: Good morning, beloved
15/08/2020, 08:18 - Bee: My grandmother ('Mai' in Konkani) hasn't had fever since morning 🤩
15/08/2020, 10:46 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/08/2020, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! So glad to hear your Mai is feeling better 😊
15/08/2020, 11:03 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. That must've been uncomfortable to keep your mouth like that. Your determination amazes me
15/08/2020, 11:03 - Nischal Abraham: And see!! You managed to pull off short hair
15/08/2020, 14:51 - Bee: Bbbbbbbbbbbbbb
15/08/2020, 14:51 - Bee: Priya's family had come over
15/08/2020, 14:51 - Bee: I'm sure it was painful. Good thing I don't remember the pain tho
15/08/2020, 14:52 - Bee: Nooooo this is a boy cut ya. Ashley and I used to go to the same men's salon
15/08/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice!! How was time with their family?
15/08/2020, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea you'd told me 😂. But most kids look cute regardless of hairstyles
15/08/2020, 15:27 - Bee: It was awkward at first but fine later
15/08/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Yes and the same hairstyle now would look 🤮
15/08/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: No no. I'm sure you'd look 🔥
15/08/2020, 15:33 - Bee: If I color my hair red and orange and style it in spikes then literally yes I would look like 🔥
15/08/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Is that a look you want to achieve? That's interesting... There's not a lot of people brave enough to pull that off
15/08/2020, 15:59 - Bee: Nahhh not a look I want to achieve. I'm going to grow my hair out
15/08/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: If I'm being honest I like your hair ☺️. But the only alternative I've seen is that pic you just shared so who knows...
15/08/2020, 16:10 - Bee: You like it how it's now? The current length?
15/08/2020, 16:11 - Bee: I'll send more photos. Played dress up too much as a child
15/08/2020, 16:11 - Bee: But my hair was the same. Short hair throughout my childhood
15/08/2020, 16:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/08/2020, 16:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/08/2020, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha that look you have 🤣
15/08/2020, 16:15 - Bee: 😂
15/08/2020, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Well as much as I can see on video call anyway. But yea like beyond shoulder length. But I've heard my sister complain many many times so I know the hassle that long hair is
15/08/2020, 16:20 - Bee: Ahhhh. I like my current length. But when I see girls with long hair I feel like growing mine out too 😐
15/08/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: And then when you have long hair you'll wish it was shorter. I've heard that one before 🤔
15/08/2020, 16:30 - Bee: You're right. The cycle never ends
15/08/2020, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: How's your evening going? Anything special for dinner?
15/08/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Evening is going alright. Pretty uneventful. We had mutton after a loooong time today. Maa cooked mutton because Priya and fam came over
15/08/2020, 16:59 - Bee: How's your evening going?
15/08/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I haven't washed my hair yet :((((( it was a busy day. But when I had the time in the afternoon I took a nap. I should go take a shower now
15/08/2020, 17:14 - Nischal Abraham: My evening is uneventful as always. It's been a surreal day but that may partly be because I haven't really done a whole lot except watch videos
15/08/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Ahh. Any cooking experiments?
15/08/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Not today. Too much of leftover. I'll go shopping on Monday
15/08/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free for a call whenever you are btw
15/08/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Okay. I'll be free in 15
15/08/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Nischal
15/08/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/08/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Nischal
15/08/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Nischal?
15/08/2020, 18:51 - Bee: HI
15/08/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
15/08/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Yes
16/08/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Have a nice day, you. 😊
16/08/2020, 09:12 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks! I hope you do too!!
16/08/2020, 12:12 - Bee: I ordered myself new nail polishes!!!!! IM  EXCITED TO PAINT MY NAILSSSSSS
16/08/2020, 12:12 - Bee: It's a birthday gift from me to me 😂
16/08/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Using them immediately or saving them for an occasion?
16/08/2020, 14:47 - Bee: They'll take a week or so to arrive. Won't be saving them for any occasion. Will use as as and when I feel like it
16/08/2020, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool. I thought when you said ordered you meant earlier and you received it now
16/08/2020, 16:01 - Bee: Nahh I ordered today
16/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: What are you doing?
16/08/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Watching The Umbrella Academy. I'll probably feel really sleepy soon but for now that's what I'm doing
16/08/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: What about you?
16/08/2020, 16:30 - Bee: Ooh. Is that on Netflix?
16/08/2020, 16:30 - Bee: I just finished dinner
16/08/2020, 16:30 - Bee: So early 😂
16/08/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: So early!!!! What!? How!??
16/08/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: It is... But I was streaming it online since I don't have Netflix
16/08/2020, 16:55 - Bee: I was hungry. Couldn't wait any longer. I had a light lunch
16/08/2020, 16:55 - Bee: And no snack in the evening
16/08/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Are you taking a nap then
16/08/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Ahh. How's the movie?
16/08/2020, 16:56 - Bee: MY NAIL POLISHES WILL BE HERE THIS WEEK!!!
16/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: It's a TV show. It's interesting, the second season just released recently
16/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Na if I take a nap now I won't sleep at night. I'll just stay up till bedtime
16/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Won't you feel hungry later?
16/08/2020, 16:58 - Bee: OH I thought it's a movie
16/08/2020, 16:59 - Bee: I might yes
16/08/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Then it'll be snack time I guess
16/08/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds very exciting Debby 😁
16/08/2020, 17:26 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/08/2020, 17:26 - Bee: There are no snacks at home
16/08/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: 😱
16/08/2020, 17:36 - Bee: I saw your emoji in the notifications and I thought it was for this
16/08/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Usually I'm the one who buys snacks and junk but I didn't go last week
16/08/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well whichever you want to put it to. But I was more surprised you don't have snacks at home
16/08/2020, 17:55 - Bee: I will restock this week
16/08/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Didn't feel like having oily stuff the last few dats
16/08/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Days*
16/08/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: That's healthy 😁

16/08/2020, 21:15 - Bee: Oh. All okay?
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Bee: I started reading chapter 3
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: OH you're still awake 😮
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Bee: I am
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Will go to sleep now
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you'd have gone to bed already
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Nope
16/08/2020, 21:16 - Bee: What is this bb. I forgot to ask you during the call
16/08/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: Right right. All okay. I was trying to get in touch with her earlier but she was busy so I wanted to be on call while she's free now
16/08/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Ahhhhh. Cool
16/08/2020, 21:17 - Bee: I'll go to sleep now
16/08/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Bye Nischal
16/08/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Debby 😊
16/08/2020, 21:18 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/08/2020, 21:19 - Bee: Goodnight. :)
16/08/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: So you're saying you're cuter than me as a beet...
16/08/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: I agree 😊
16/08/2020, 21:19 - Bee: 🔪
16/08/2020, 21:20 - Bee: So you're saying I'm a beet
16/08/2020, 21:20 - Bee: Okay bye nana
16/08/2020, 21:20 - Nischal Abraham: Well the beet version of you is cuter than me 😂
16/08/2020, 21:21 - Nischal Abraham: Byee
17/08/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Beet version of me?
17/08/2020, 08:51 - Bee: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
17/08/2020, 08:52 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/08/2020, 09:42 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Debby! How was your stay at Usha auntys?
17/08/2020, 10:19 - Bee: Hellooo
17/08/2020, 10:20 - Bee: It was good! I saw all of Aunty's albums with photos of her young self
17/08/2020, 10:20 - Bee: And two of my nail polishes arrived!! One's a transparent one
17/08/2020, 10:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/08/2020, 10:21 - Nischal Abraham: Where did you order you nail polishes from? 😮. That was super quick
17/08/2020, 10:22 - Bee: IKR I was surprised that it took just one day. From a website called Nykaa
17/08/2020, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that sounds lovely
17/08/2020, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: Follow up question, how many did you order? 😂
17/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: 😛
17/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: Only 5. But we shouldn't count one because it's transparent
17/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: So 4
17/08/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'd still count it as 5. If you plan on using it then it's still nail polish right? Though I was expecting brighter colours the way you described your preference yesterday
17/08/2020, 10:38 - Bee: But I'll be using it over another color so no we can't count it nana
17/08/2020, 10:38 - Bee: This is the only tame color. The others are bright
17/08/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Well I guess I don't know how nail polish works then 🤣
17/08/2020, 10:45 - Bee: The nail polish won't chip and will remain for longer if there's a transparent cost on top. That's all
17/08/2020, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: That makes sense. But couldn't you just use the transparent one on its own as well? Like is it a different quality of nail polish or is the only difference the colour?
17/08/2020, 11:23 - Bee: The only difference is the color. I can use it by itself too
17/08/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: So you're essentially putting on two layers of nail polish with the coloured ones then
17/08/2020, 11:38 - Bee: Correct
17/08/2020, 11:38 - Nischal Abraham: TIL
17/08/2020, 11:39 - Bee: But for brighter colors I use two coats of the color itself because it doesn't look vibrant otherwise
17/08/2020, 11:39 - Bee: 👏🏽
17/08/2020, 11:39 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/08/2020, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the rest of the day?
17/08/2020, 11:41 - Bee: Continue prep for sisters meeting. And read some. That's all
17/08/2020, 11:42 - Bee: What're your plans?
17/08/2020, 11:45 - Bee: I MADE PLANS TO MEET REENEE!!!!
17/08/2020, 11:45 - Bee: After so many months
17/08/2020, 11:46 - Bee: Today
17/08/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: OHHH!!! YOU'RE ALLOWED TO MEET PEOPLE FINALLY!?
17/08/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: Are you going to her place?
17/08/2020, 11:48 - Bee: I don't know... But I've seen people meeting people waayyy back
17/08/2020, 11:48 - Bee: No we're meeting at meadows
17/08/2020, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Hope you'll be wearing your mask Debby. Are restaurants open again?
17/08/2020, 12:05 - Bee: Yes I'll be wearing my mask
17/08/2020, 12:06 - Bee: I don't know about restaurants... But I heard that all shops are open now. I don't know if restaurants fall under the shops category
17/08/2020, 12:06 - Bee: We're just going to take a walk
17/08/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Sounds fun! Have a good time Bee!! You mustn't have met all through lockdown right?
17/08/2020, 12:36 - Bee: Nope. We last met on the 15th of march
17/08/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: That's sooo long ago! I'm excited for you!!
17/08/2020, 14:53 - Bee: It was a lovely long walk!
17/08/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! I ended up falling asleep Debby. Now I won't be able to sleep at night 😱
17/08/2020, 19:07 - Bee: HI!!!!!!
17/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: I was on an impromptu call with Ruth
17/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: How did you 'end up' falling asleep? Did you close your eyes as told yourself 'only 5 minutes'?
17/08/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Oh has the family gone back?
17/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: I told myself 10 min but it ended up being an hour and a half
17/08/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Not that I ever manage to sleep only 10 min. But it was so nice and chilly
17/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: No they're still here. Ruth wanted to show me her new glasses and we ended up talking about a lot more
17/08/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Btw I'm free when you are. Just got done with dinner
17/08/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Give me 10? I'm yet to take a shower
17/08/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Cool
17/08/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Nischal
17/08/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Hi
17/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Hi Nischal
17/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Hellooooo
17/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Nischal
17/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: I'm Debby
17/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Hi
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: No?
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Wru?!
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Hiiiiiiiiiiii
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: I just finished
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! I'll call?
17/08/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Yessssss

18/08/2020, 09:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/08/2020, 09:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/08/2020, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: Fancy! Why does it look like the leftmost bottle has less quantity than the other 2?
18/08/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Maybe because it does have less quantity
18/08/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Different brands so 🤷🏽‍♀️
18/08/2020, 12:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I didn't even notice that. I just had a nice long call with Sahil! How's your day going?
18/08/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Beloved hi
18/08/2020, 15:01 - Bee: I'm sorry about the late reply
18/08/2020, 15:02 - Bee: I was napping, and then was woken up to go grocery shopping. I got up at once because I would get to drive. And then just drove around until prayer meeting time (now)
18/08/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. You got to drive!! The weather looks like it's clearing up so I'll probably head to the shops in some time
18/08/2020, 16:16 - Bee: I got to drive yes!!
18/08/2020, 16:16 - Bee: Ahh that's nice. My day is going okay. Rested a LOT
18/08/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yay had a nice sunny day to walk in. It's looking like it's gonna start raining again now so I'm glad I went when I did
18/08/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Yay!!! Anything new you're gonna try with this batch of ingredients?
18/08/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing new. Just refilling
18/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Oh
18/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Would you like to get on a call?
18/08/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Could you give me 10 min. I'll go take a shower
18/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Yes yes. In 15? I need 15
18/08/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. I'm done. Let me know when you're free
18/08/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Give me 10 minutes
18/08/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Sorry man
18/08/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: 👍🏼
18/08/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Hi
18/08/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
18/08/2020, 19:38 - Bee: I'll call?
18/08/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
19/08/2020, 09:45 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/08/2020, 09:45 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/08/2020, 09:45 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/08/2020, 09:45 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/08/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. Now shimmer and glitter makes sense
19/08/2020, 09:47 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/08/2020, 09:47 - Bee: Yes they're different. I don't have glitter, I have shimmery ones
19/08/2020, 09:47 - Bee: These are the only finishes I know
19/08/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Fancy stuff. I hope you have a great day ahead Debby!
19/08/2020, 09:57 - Bee: You too, Nischal. 😊
19/08/2020, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How's your day been? Did anything exciting?
19/08/2020, 17:14 - Bee: Hi!!!!
19/08/2020, 17:15 - Bee: My day was alright. Didn't do much
19/08/2020, 17:15 - Bee: Was at home the whole day
19/08/2020, 17:15 - Bee: I've got some news
19/08/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: News regarding your exam!? What is it? Or do you want to save it for a call?
19/08/2020, 18:35 - Bee: No no not regarding exam
19/08/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Can I call you for a bit? Hardly 10 minutes
19/08/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Less than 10 minutes
19/08/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sure. I'm free till 8
19/08/2020, 19:03 - Bee: I'll call?
19/08/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
20/08/2020, 09:19 - Bee: Hi Nischal
20/08/2020, 09:19 - Bee: Jason and I have tested negative
20/08/2020, 09:19 - Bee: Maa, Mai, Ashley, and my uncle (who was staying with Jessy aunty but stayed with us for a couple days) have tested positive
20/08/2020, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you all Debby! So will you all be quarantined at home or are they in the hospital?
20/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: I will be staying with Jessy aunty. Maa, Ashley, uncle will be quarantined at home. Mai is getting admitted at Bethany. No symptoms but just for observation
20/08/2020, 10:43 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Have you already made the move there?
20/08/2020, 10:43 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God that there's been no symptoms despite it coming positive 😊
20/08/2020, 10:45 - Bee: No I'm at the hospital. Maa, Ashley, uncle are getting x-rays done. Because protocol. Then we'll go home
20/08/2020, 10:45 - Bee: Yes, praise God! Especially Mai. Truly a miracle that she's alright
20/08/2020, 10:47 - Nischal Abraham: So if it's come negative for you, does that mean your fever before was not Covid related? And I'm guessing Jason will be staying at Jessy aunty's place as well right
20/08/2020, 10:48 - Bee: Or I've recovered (if I had it)
20/08/2020, 10:48 - Bee: Jason will be staying there too
20/08/2020, 10:50 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! I know a lot of people do recover but I still feel worried. I like the emotion though cause it reminds me to keep praying about it
20/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: I'm a little worried too. For my grandmother... She doesn't like hospitals
20/08/2020, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: I don't like hospitals either so I sympathise with her
20/08/2020, 12:33 - Bee: Yeah. I'm afraid that the loneliness will get to her Nischal
20/08/2020, 12:50 - Bee: I told Prachi didi that I won't be able to take the meeting tomorrow. I'm quite disturbed
20/08/2020, 12:50 - Bee: She said it's okay. Can postpone it to next week. So no worry
20/08/2020, 13:02 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be alright Bee
20/08/2020, 14:34 - Bee: Praying so
20/08/2020, 17:28 - Bee: I'm staying downstairs instead of Jessy aunty's. The small place beside Flory Aunty's
20/08/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Alone?
20/08/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: How are you managing food and all?
20/08/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Yes
20/08/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Maa is sending food from upstairs. The watchman uncle will bring it down
20/08/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Hope you don't feel lonely. At least you still get mom's cooking 😊
20/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: I'll be fine
20/08/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Yep. Home cooked food is the only thing about home that I'll have for a few days
20/08/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: How are you feeling?
20/08/2020, 19:25 - Bee: I am feeling sad
20/08/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Want to get on a call?
20/08/2020, 19:33 - Bee: I just want to go to sleep Nischal
20/08/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Is that okay?
20/08/2020, 19:33 - Bee: We'll talk tomorrow?
20/08/2020, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Of course that's fine
20/08/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Rest well Bee 😊. I'm praying with you
20/08/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal.
20/08/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Goodnight :)
20/08/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
21/08/2020, 06:58 - Bee: SO ANYBODY CAN LEARN ANYTHING!
21/08/2020, 06:58 - Bee: I enjoyed the montage at the end where both were juggling
21/08/2020, 07:53 - Nischal Abraham: EXACTLY!
21/08/2020, 07:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it was very cute ☺️
21/08/2020, 07:54 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! How'd your morning go? You've got all the freedom of staying alone with added benefits of not having to worry about food!
21/08/2020, 08:14 - Bee: Morning was alright. Woke up early and had nothing to do
21/08/2020, 08:14 - Bee: Yes I've got all the freedom but nothing to do!
21/08/2020, 08:14 - Bee: And I have only 1.5GB of data each day. Limiting my use so that I don't run out before midnight
21/08/2020, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: Only 1.5GB? That's a lot of data. It does restrict you from streaming videos too much. Oh and WhatsApp calls would take up data as well! Do you know how much gets used up?
21/08/2020, 09:18 - Bee: It gets over quick ya!! Yes I have an app which shows the speed and the amount of data used
21/08/2020, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Sounds like the perfect opportunity to get some reading done! Btw if you're ever too bored and want to talk I'm free all day
21/08/2020, 09:23 - Nischal Abraham: And I may have my Bible study with the guys tonight
21/08/2020, 09:23 - Nischal Abraham: What's the status on your family? Health still doing okay?
21/08/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Right back at you. I have aaallll the time in the world now
21/08/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Oh that's nice. Isn't this the longest you've gone without having a Bible study with the lads?
21/08/2020, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: Its only been a week off. I think we've done that before
21/08/2020, 09:51 - Bee: Still doing okay. Cannot thank God enough
21/08/2020, 09:51 - Bee: Oh
21/08/2020, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: You're limited by your data pack. And y'know if there's other people you're talking to through the day
21/08/2020, 09:59 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God! 😁
21/08/2020, 10:10 - Bee: Yes a few people have called. Many have messaged. Very kind of them
21/08/2020, 10:10 - Bee: Reenee sent me a waffle!!!!!
21/08/2020, 10:10 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!!
21/08/2020, 10:11 - Bee: A red velvet waffle 😭
21/08/2020, 10:11 - Bee: This is my first waffle in months
21/08/2020, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: Waffle!!! I haven't had one in months 😭
21/08/2020, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! I was thinking if you want to pass the time you could take an afternoon nap
21/08/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Yes I plan on doing that. I was thinking I'll read a book. I won't notice the time passing by
21/08/2020, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your time ☺️. Offer for a call stands for anytime Bee. Anytime till my 8pm anyway
21/08/2020, 10:48 - Bee: I will take you up on your offer. Once I've had my afternoon nap
21/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: But the thing is...I'm not sleepy. Because I slept really well last night. It was a tiring day yesterday
21/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: I will try to sleep tho
21/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: How's your day going?
21/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: What's up?
21/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: The waffle was delicious.
21/08/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: I think I ate too much for breakfast so how I'm being lethargic in the morning
21/08/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Now*
21/08/2020, 14:10 - Bee: Oh
21/08/2020, 14:10 - Bee: What was for breakfast?
21/08/2020, 14:24 - Nischal Abraham: Bread eggs and sausages
21/08/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How was your nap?
21/08/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: I ended up taking a nap too so I just finished with lunch now 😂
21/08/2020, 14:52 - Bee: HIIIII Nischal
21/08/2020, 14:52 - Bee: Lunch at 3 😱
21/08/2020, 14:53 - Bee: It was raining heavily and the fan was on full speed. It was a lovely nap. I'm still a little groggy
21/08/2020, 14:53 - Bee: We have our family zoom meeting today

24/08/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not sure if I'll be able to bee on a call with you Bee
24/08/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Oh :( entered the next stage?!
24/08/2020, 08:58 - Bee: That's okay Nischal. You rest and get better. Drink lots of warm water. And take steam. And eat properly. We've got enough days to talk 😊
24/08/2020, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: OHH! I took steam last night and this morning 😁
24/08/2020, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: That kettle hack should go into LPT Debby!! It's so convenient as a steam machine and the opening is not very wide so I don't even need a towel
24/08/2020, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: And after I've steamed I've got drinking hot water ready 😮
24/08/2020, 09:04 - Bee: This could be my first Reddit post!!!!

24/08/2020, 09:06 - Bee: Papa said I can go back upstairs. But I cleaned the house so well I don't feel like leaving
24/08/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoying your staycation experience?
24/08/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God!
24/08/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: What about your dad? Is he still in the hospital?
24/08/2020, 09:09 - Bee: I am! Even more because I don't have to cook.
24/08/2020, 09:09 - Bee: Still in the hospital. He'll be discharged by the end of this week

24/08/2020, 09:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 09:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 09:29 - Bee: Guess which one's the before
24/08/2020, 09:29 - Bee: I do. I meant if I was staying alone and had to cook for myself, then I'd probably not stay another day
24/08/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Before
24/08/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: After?
24/08/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea... I get what you mean
24/08/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Nooooooo 😂
24/08/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Before
24/08/2020, 10:27 - Bee: After
24/08/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. Well it was a 50/50. Is it for threading your 'stache?
24/08/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: And you changed up the lighting 😑
24/08/2020, 10:31 - Bee: Yes
24/08/2020, 10:31 - Bee: I don't know how to take the exact same photo twice!!
24/08/2020, 10:31 - Bee: I mean in the exact same pose/position and lighting and allll
24/08/2020, 10:32 - Bee: Bb, you don't have to reply okay. Rest!!
24/08/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: I am resting. I'm resting and bored. But if I delay in replying please don't mind
24/08/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Although I am getting a lot of exercise going to the bathroom every 15 min
24/08/2020, 10:43 - Bee: I won't mind nana

24/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
24/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Warming up to do better when I get better
24/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I forgot!
24/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 10:47 - Nischal Abraham: First thing I took this morning as soon as I got up. Tell me it isn't the worst pick ever and you're lying 😶
24/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: HAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
24/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: It isn't the worst, Nischal!
24/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: I'm not lying
24/08/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Why have you folded your upper lip in
24/08/2020, 10:54 - Bee: 🤔
24/08/2020, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: The only conscious thing I did for that pic was try to smile so I don't look depressed
24/08/2020, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: That's the appropriate response 😂
24/08/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/7g7A9InJM6E
24/08/2020, 11:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 11:31 - Bee: The dress that Jason was going to buy
24/08/2020, 11:31 - Bee: You're smiling?!
24/08/2020, 11:31 - Bee: I shall watch it
24/08/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: Eh... I'm sorry Bee I don't think I like the dress
24/08/2020, 11:32 - Bee: I don't either
24/08/2020, 11:32 - Bee: Jason thought I would like it
24/08/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: "trying to smile"
24/08/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: Well its hard to know what a girl likes y'know. I don't know what dresses you'd like
24/08/2020, 11:33 - Bee: He could've consulted Priya. Maybe he did
24/08/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: But he did let you choose your own! You must've shortlisted something
24/08/2020, 11:34 - Bee: No i haven't. Still looking at stuff. He told me the offers ends tomorrow. And so I will find something
24/08/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: Wow an ultimatum. So what happens if you don't choose by tomorrow?
24/08/2020, 12:07 - Bee: He says he won't get me a gift but I think he will anyway
24/08/2020, 12:08 - Bee: I watched episode 3 and 4 of The Chosen
24/08/2020, 12:08 - Bee: I'm moved
24/08/2020, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: It's nice right!?
24/08/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Haha well I guess it's always better to be on the safer side
24/08/2020, 13:28 - Bee: It is :)
24/08/2020, 14:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: Is that swiggy? It looks different than I remember
24/08/2020, 14:40 - Bee: Yes, swiggy
24/08/2020, 14:40 - Bee: Ashley's taste senses are back
24/08/2020, 14:40 - Bee: How are you feeling?
24/08/2020, 14:41 - Bee: ...
24/08/2020, 14:56 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! My taste senses still exist so good sign. It's not the worst I've felt. But the weakness comes and goes so I'm mostly just lying down
24/08/2020, 15:01 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Do you have a headache?
24/08/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Are you feeling feverish?
24/08/2020, 15:17 - Bee: I need a waffle maker.
24/08/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Did you enjoy?
24/08/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: No other feeling so far. Mild headache but I think it's more my sinus. I took steam in the afternoon as well so I'll do it again later tonight
24/08/2020, 15:39 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 15:42 - Bee: Does it feel better after steam?
24/08/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. But it always feels like temporary relief. Sometimes I wonder if I feel worse because of it. But then again maybe I'm just feeling worse in general
24/08/2020, 16:27 - Bee: You have to get worse to get better. (Your stages of a cold from yesterday)
24/08/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: True. How was your day? Did you end up calling everyone you wanted to?
24/08/2020, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Your phone will be busy all night today
24/08/2020, 16:49 - Bee: My day's been okay. I watched three more episodes of The Chosen. I did call everyone I wanted to
24/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: I usually turn my phone off the night before my birthday. But it doesn't feel right to do that this year
24/08/2020, 16:51 - Bee: The call with Ruth was kinda short tho. She was getting another call and said that she'll call me after. But she hasn't. Is she still on that call?!
24/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. Yea it's probably best to leave it on this time. But if you're going to bed then you're the only one who should decide that 😊
24/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't that all of it!? Are you done watching!!! 😱
24/08/2020, 17:13 - Bee: No no. Three in total today. So I've watched 5 in all. Three more to go
24/08/2020, 17:14 - Bee: nahhh won't be sleepy at 12
24/08/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. I misunderstood 3 more episodes
24/08/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: So what was for dinner? What're you doing now?
24/08/2020, 17:22 - Bee: No no
24/08/2020, 17:23 - Bee: I haven't had dinner yet. I think maa will send a ham sandwich. I'm not hungry... Anything other than a sandwich will be too heavy
24/08/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Just finished my loonngg shower. Taking off old nail polish now
24/08/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Cookie crumble going on? (I hope that's what it was... I know it was some sweet related name)
24/08/2020, 17:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/08/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Are you okay Bee 🙁. You don't seem to be eating a lot these days
24/08/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I am okay nana. I've been munching on banana chips throughout the day
24/08/2020, 17:56 - Bee: And been sitting in one place
24/08/2020, 17:58 - Bee: I used the fancy scented lotion after my shower. I feel so goooooood ☺️
24/08/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's nice! I just spoke to Nidhi after many days
24/08/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Ahh .. are her holidays still going on?
24/08/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I think for all of this week
24/08/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Oh wow. Must be a much needed break
24/08/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe. She said she's got assignments she's still needs to do
24/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Oh 🤦🏽‍♀️
24/08/2020, 18:58 - Bee: It's okay. Better than having lectures and assignments
24/08/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. I couldn't pay a lot of attention to the call sadly 😞
24/08/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Aww :( cold getting worse?
24/08/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. But I wish I slept in the afternoon now
24/08/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: How was the sandwich? Or have you not eaten yet? 😮
24/08/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Was your call in the afternoon?
24/08/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Go to sleep early no
24/08/2020, 19:06 - Bee: I ate looonng ago
24/08/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: No just a few minutes back
24/08/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yea but I need to eat dinner first
24/08/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: I need to prepare dinner 😢
24/08/2020, 19:07 - Bee: No leftovers at all?
24/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Oats won't require much effort right?
24/08/2020, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: I had oats in the morning...
24/08/2020, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: My least effort meal will be Porotta and eggs
24/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: It's okay you can have again no. Unless it's torture
24/08/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Do you have porotta?
24/08/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Just need to microwave it
24/08/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Oh

25/08/2020, 08:15 - Bee: Bite*
25/08/2020, 08:17 - Nischal Abraham: I've always looked forward to that Bee 😊. If it's a bite from you I don't mind taking it
25/08/2020, 08:36 - Bee: :).
25/08/2020, 08:36 - Bee: How's your cold?
25/08/2020, 08:36 - Bee: How are you?
25/08/2020, 08:42 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God I'm feeling so much better today!! Nose is still a bit blocked but my head and throat feel fine so just another day of gargling and steam but I don't feel like sleeping in bed all day 😁
25/08/2020, 08:43 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope it stays that way throughout the day. But for now I'm good
25/08/2020, 08:43 - Nischal Abraham: Are you back home now? Anything special happen?
25/08/2020, 08:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 08:49 - Bee: My secret is out.
25/08/2020, 08:50 - Bee: That's a relief. Continuing to pray that it remains manageable
25/08/2020, 08:50 - Bee: No I'm still here. I'll go in the evening
25/08/2020, 08:50 - Bee: SO MANY SPECIAL THINGS NISCHAL
25/08/2020, 08:51 - Bee: I thought this birthday wouldn't be a good one. I was wrong.
25/08/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Also, Sammy and Ruth sent goodies!
25/08/2020, 08:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 08:51 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: 😮. He ratted you out! Good thing it's your birthday or I'm sure Joyce would have a word or two to say to you
25/08/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: WOAH THAT'S AWESOME!!! Did they mail it? How did they time it so well?
25/08/2020, 09:03 - Bee: Hahahaha no she knows about it. It was yeeaaarrss ago
25/08/2020, 09:03 - Bee: She laughed it off. On the outside. On the inside I don't know
25/08/2020, 09:03 - Bee: No... Zomato!!!!
25/08/2020, 10:09 - Bee: https://www.1happybirthday.com/play_song.php?name=Debbie
25/08/2020, 10:09 - Bee: Ravi uncle sent
25/08/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Wow. I would not have expected that from Ravi uncle 😂
25/08/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: It has the same energy as this one!
25/08/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: That's so smart 😮
25/08/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
25/08/2020, 11:01 - Bee: 😂
25/08/2020, 11:02 - Bee: On Reenee's 19th birthday, Ben and I organized a treasure hunt thing for her with all of her college friends. After the hunt we went over to hers for lunch. And at that time Ravi uncle played this song with Reenee's name in front of everyone. She was a little embarrassed 😂
25/08/2020, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: You got off easy then 😂
25/08/2020, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: Happy Birthday Bee!
25/08/2020, 12:23 - Bee: What stuff are you skipping? And why are you skipping stuff? 🤔
25/08/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Please give them thanks from me?
25/08/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: CUI has an event called EQUIP. So there's sessions and stuff. It'll be in the evening but I wanted to find opportunity to call you
25/08/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: Stephen is taking part in it as well
25/08/2020, 12:35 - Bee: Oh...
25/08/2020, 12:37 - Bee: The I in CUI stands for Ireland?
25/08/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Will the sessions be recorded?
25/08/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Looking forward to whenever we get to talk. 😊
25/08/2020, 12:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 12:44 - Bee: Joyce just delivered this 🥺
25/08/2020, 12:44 - Bee: She took the photo
25/08/2020, 12:45 - Bee: I saw her!!!!!!!
25/08/2020, 12:45 - Bee: She came to the door!!!!!
25/08/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: That looks like those stock photos of cakes on Google
25/08/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/08/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: I think so. It's alright. It'll go on for another 3 days so I'll be attending those
25/08/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Happy birthday Debby! Enjoy your cake 😁
25/08/2020, 15:06 - Bee: Buuuuut it isn't
25/08/2020, 15:06 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal :)
25/08/2020, 15:06 - Bee: Thank you, marshmallow!!! 🥰
25/08/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Nischal
25/08/2020, 15:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 15:44 - Bee: This came up when I switched on the laptop
25/08/2020, 15:44 - Bee: I don't know what to do
25/08/2020, 15:44 - Bee: What do I click on?
25/08/2020, 15:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: You could just save and exit if you've made no changes. So just press f10
25/08/2020, 15:47 - Bee: Okay
25/08/2020, 15:48 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. I don't like how it says reset 😑. Did you do something just before this happened?
25/08/2020, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: If you can try then see what happens when you press f9 as well
25/08/2020, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for the late response! I was making lunch for myself
25/08/2020, 15:54 - Bee: No. The last time I used it I didn't switch it off. I clicked on 'sleep'
25/08/2020, 15:54 - Bee: Don't be sorry. I should be sorry for troubling you
25/08/2020, 15:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 15:55 - Bee: Don't reply of you can't. I'm not in a hurry
25/08/2020, 15:55 - Bee: No urgent work
25/08/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay just googled it. I think f10 should work fine
25/08/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Continue after you press f10. Reset just means restarting the machine again
25/08/2020, 16:00 - Bee: I clicked on reset. And this opened again. 🤦🏽‍♀️
25/08/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Should I let the battery run out
25/08/2020, 16:00 - Bee: Waaaiiiitt.
25/08/2020, 16:00 - Bee: No don't wait.
25/08/2020, 16:01 - Bee: Same thing. Again
25/08/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: That's the last option to try out. Try boot menu?
25/08/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Or... Give me 20 min I'll finish eating and give you a call
25/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!
25/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/08/2020, 16:02 - Bee: It went away
25/08/2020, 16:04 - Bee: I'm sorry about the trouble.
25/08/2020, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! Don't worry about it 😊. Glad it's fixed
25/08/2020, 16:43 - Bee: :)
25/08/2020, 16:43 - Bee: I thought all of my data will be lost
25/08/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so glad it isn't! Did you head back home to share the cake?
25/08/2020, 16:46 - Bee: Nope. Papa said it'll be better if I stay here for a week at least. So until Thursday
25/08/2020, 16:47 - Bee: I did send some cake though
25/08/2020, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: Ah is it because they need to be quarantined since they came back home?
25/08/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Yes
25/08/2020, 16:48 - Bee: How's your coldm
25/08/2020, 16:48 - Bee: ?*
25/08/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Have you been drinking warm water?
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. I've been doing quite well today. For the most part it feels like I'm completely fine but occasionally I feel feverish but only for a few minutes
25/08/2020, 16:49 - Bee: You're typing so much
25/08/2020, 16:49 - Bee: So long
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Exclusively
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Oh
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Okay
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Completely fine for the most part is good no
25/08/2020, 16:50 - Bee: What's up?
25/08/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: It is!! It's amazing. I got up this morning and everything was just cleared up and I was just praising God for all of it
25/08/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: I got done with lunch and came back upstairs. Counting the minutes till I get to talk to you now
25/08/2020, 16:52 - Bee: I am counting too!!!
25/08/2020, 16:52 - Bee: When will you be free?
25/08/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Anytime from now
25/08/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: When will you be free?
25/08/2020, 16:56 - Bee: I will be free in 15. There's one call I have to make
25/08/2020, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. I'm sure you have many things to keep you occupied
25/08/2020, 17:03 - Bee: I'll call?
25/08/2020, 17:04 - Bee: No wait
25/08/2020, 17:04 - Bee: I have to send a photo of the cake to Joyce
25/08/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool
25/08/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: For I am sure of this very thing, that the one who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
Phillipians 1:6

You had shared this verse to me on my birthday. I don't know if you remember but this is the verse I was praying over you back in 2018. Merin had asked us to pick a verse for your birthday and pray that for the year to come. It's incredible looking back and seeing how God's been fulfilling that prayer.

Bee, you have a heart of gold and a mind refined like silver. Compassionate, affectionate, thoughtful in word and deed. There are many times I wish my natural tendencies were more like yours. But it is our differences that really help me see how blessed God has been. To you for making you as you are in His image. And to me for allowing me to experience you.

I continue praying that verse for you Debby. And this year I get to do it with you. I know it's your birthday but I'm stealing your lines now cause it's so true.
"You have been the greatest gift to me apart from amazing grace"
25/08/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Happy remembrance of your birth day 😁
25/08/2020, 17:57 - Bee: You're gonna break my record.
25/08/2020, 17:57 - Bee: Beloved
25/08/2020, 17:57 - Bee: Can I call?
25/08/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/08/2020, 20:01 - Bee: Nischal
25/08/2020, 20:02 - Bee: I'm gonna pee.
25/08/2020, 20:02 - Bee: Brb.
25/08/2020, 20:04 - Bee: I'm back
25/08/2020, 20:04 - Bee: Nischal
25/08/2020, 20:04 - Bee: Nischal
25/08/2020, 20:04 - Bee: I'll call?
25/08/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: hey
25/08/2020, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/08/2020, 20:40 - Bee: Nischal. I'm so sorry. Please please please give me a few more minutes
25/08/2020, 20:40 - Bee: Just praying and then ending the call
25/08/2020, 20:40 - Bee: What about your dinner?
25/08/2020, 20:40 - Bee: I'll be up whenever you're back if you want to have your dinner first
25/08/2020, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. Don't worry about me... Let me know when you're done and I'll let you know if I'm free then 😊
25/08/2020, 21:47 - Bee: Hi
25/08/2020, 21:47 - Bee: I am free whenever you are.
25/08/2020, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
25/08/2020, 21:47 - Bee: No hurry.
25/08/2020, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free now
26/08/2020, 00:02 - Nischal Abraham: Hi. I now have to wait one whole year to wish you on your birthday.
26/08/2020, 00:13 - Bee: Hey! I'm not in the right frame of mind to be talking right now (I'm sleepy). Don't know if I was smart or stupid in my decision (the decision to talk to my Marshmallow. I was smart, obv)
26/08/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: You have always been the smarter one 😁. Happy remembrance of our unintentional first date Bee
26/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: Happy remembrance day of our unintentional first date to you too!
26/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: I love that
26/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: This
26/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: This!!!
26/08/2020, 10:24 - Bee: ☺️
26/08/2020, 10:26 - Nischal Abraham: Haha 😂. How's your morning been? What time did you get up?
26/08/2020, 10:32 - Bee: It was alright. Woke up at 8 to another birthday wish call 😫 and then went back to sleep and woke up at 10
26/08/2020, 10:32 - Bee: Which isn't bad
26/08/2020, 10:33 - Bee: Berachah is going through some hard stuff. Reenee and I are making a funny video for her
26/08/2020, 10:33 - Bee: Been working on that since 12. Forgot that it was lunch time. My family forgot too 🥺 but I received lunch now. So I'll eat
26/08/2020, 10:33 - Bee: How's your day going?
26/08/2020, 10:33 - Bee: I'm feeling all bubbly inside Nisch!!!
26/08/2020, 10:34 - Bee: ☺️
26/08/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Well bubbly is good if you're trying to make a funny video!
26/08/2020, 10:36 - Nischal Abraham: On that note, I learnt that you like the song Bubbly by Colbie Callait. I don't think I knew that before
26/08/2020, 10:36 - Nischal Abraham: I just had my breakfast a few minutes back. I have leftover pasta for lunch!! Feels so nice to not have to cook 😌
26/08/2020, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: My throat feels sore today so I'm still on my hot water, gargling routine
26/08/2020, 10:40 - Bee: Noooo because it's remembrance day today
26/08/2020, 10:40 - Bee: Breakfast so late?!
26/08/2020, 10:40 - Bee: Is it pasta that you made? Or Ciba made?
26/08/2020, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: I know the cause. But you can use that feeling for the funny video! It should help right?
26/08/2020, 10:41 - Bee: Oh. Throat was alright until yesterday right?
26/08/2020, 10:41 - Bee: Yes it should
26/08/2020, 10:41 - Bee: I'll send it to you when it's done. I think it's funny
26/08/2020, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I made my egg too salty accidentally though
26/08/2020, 10:41 - Bee: Oh
26/08/2020, 10:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. But I feel better overall. Like physically I feel well enough to start working out again
26/08/2020, 10:42 - Bee: If I could I would've had fries today
26/08/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Oh!! So exercising today?
26/08/2020, 10:42 - Bee: Do you have enough groceries?
26/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Pasta I made
26/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Have to go shopping today
26/08/2020, 10:46 - Bee: 👏🏽 nice.
26/08/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: From the J?
26/08/2020, 10:47 - Bee: Oh... At least you're feeling well enough to do so
26/08/2020, 10:47 - Bee: No from Twisties
26/08/2020, 10:47 - Bee: Didn't you have some BLT sandwich
26/08/2020, 10:48 - Bee: Bacon and cheese something I think
26/08/2020, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: OH!! I just understood why 😂
26/08/2020, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: This
26/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: Oh
26/08/2020, 10:49 - Nischal Abraham: And a bottle of Bisleri
26/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: I didn't want you to pay for me but was too nervous to argue about it and you were assertive so I ordered the cheapest thing I could find
26/08/2020, 10:49 - Bee: Yesss
26/08/2020, 10:50 - Bee: I carried the empty bottle home
26/08/2020, 10:50 - Bee: I thought of keeping it but then thought it was kinda creepy. Tiny things are okay. But an empty single use water bottle? No
26/08/2020, 10:50 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... That's unfortunate you didn't get something you wanted to eat
26/08/2020, 10:50 - Bee: You were adamant about paying
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: You could keep the cap? I guess that's small
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: OHHHHHHHHHHHH
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: I feel stupid now
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... How does that stop you from eating?
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: I could've slept the cap
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: I didn't want you to pay
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: For me
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Brilliant idea ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Shyaaaaa.
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Uggggghhhhh
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Wwhhhyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!
26/08/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Or maybe the label?
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: That could've gone into my scrapbook
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ face palming through my forehead.
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Reached my brain stem.
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Kept*
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. All Bisleri bottles look the same so you can just get another one 😂
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Hahahahaha
26/08/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Was that Bisleri?
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: It was an off brand
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: But I wanted to pay! Oh if only you'd read the marriage book back then
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Hahhahahahaha
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: I should've
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Then I would've had the chicken BBQ burger
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Guess we'll have to go back
26/08/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: Well the bill said 10 Rs. Bisleri. Maybe you could just order that from Twisties 😂
26/08/2020, 10:54 - Bee: 😂
26/08/2020, 10:54 - Bee: I could
26/08/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: One of the things I definitely want to do when we meet up eventually
26/08/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Unless restaurants are still closed for dine in
26/08/2020, 10:55 - Bee: I'm making a new list
26/08/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: Wasn't there already a list for this? Or maybe not
26/08/2020, 10:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/08/2020, 10:56 - Bee: No?
26/08/2020, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: I guess no actual list. I had things in my head then. Hugging you was one of them but that'll get ticked off quite early ☺️
26/08/2020, 10:57 - Bee: It will
26/08/2020, 10:57 - Bee: I'll write hugs X 100
26/08/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: That might take a while

01/09/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Random pics from our walk
01/09/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Nischal
01/09/2020, 20:08 - Bee: I backed up all my messages  from the old phone on Drive but it didn't get restored in the new one
01/09/2020, 20:08 - Bee: 😔
01/09/2020, 20:09 - Bee: But when I go to the back up option in the new one it says there is a 1GB backup
01/09/2020, 20:09 - Bee: Should I reinstall the app?
01/09/2020, 20:10 - Bee: Took almost 3 hours to backup in the old one. Still I didn't get them here :(
01/09/2020, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Idk... But if you've got nothing in the new one now then reinstalling is a safe bet to try out
01/09/2020, 20:10 - Bee: Okay
01/09/2020, 20:11 - Bee: Brb
01/09/2020, 20:28 - Bee: Hi Nischal
01/09/2020, 20:28 - Bee: Didn't work
01/09/2020, 20:28 - Bee: 😔
01/09/2020, 20:28 - Bee: I lost all our old chats
01/09/2020, 20:29 - Bee: And Ruth and Reenee's
01/09/2020, 20:29 - Bee: Rest are okay. But I wanted these
01/09/2020, 20:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. There must be a way to get them back. Are you following a tutorial for backing them up?
01/09/2020, 20:29 - Bee: All the starred messages are gone
01/09/2020, 20:29 - Bee: No
01/09/2020, 20:29 - Bee: I should've done that
01/09/2020, 20:30 - Bee: I was following the steps as they came up with instructions
01/09/2020, 20:30 - Bee: It's okay
01/09/2020, 20:30 - Bee: Can't do anything about it now.
01/09/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: You still have your old phone right?
01/09/2020, 20:32 - Bee: Yes
01/09/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: The backup files will still be on it
01/09/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: So you can try again tomorrow
01/09/2020, 20:32 - Bee: But when I installed WhatsApp on this one it automatically logged out from the old one
01/09/2020, 20:32 - Bee: Can't have WhatsApp on two devices
01/09/2020, 20:33 - Bee: Will you send photos from your walk? I didn't download them in the old one thinking I'll download them on this one
01/09/2020, 20:33 - Nischal Abraham: I know. But there's regular backups that WhatsApp makes on the phone. So if you connect it to your laptop you'll see a file. I'll send you a tutorial

01/09/2020, 20:35 - Nischal Abraham: Technology is finicky
01/09/2020, 20:36 - Bee: 😔
01/09/2020, 20:37 - Bee: Can I find the backed up file on Google drive?
01/09/2020, 20:37 - Nischal Abraham: If you made a backup file then there should be one
01/09/2020, 20:39 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/09/2020, 20:40 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Then it should be there
01/09/2020, 20:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'll look up a tutorial for how to retrieve it. Give me 10 min. I'm just done with dinner
01/09/2020, 20:41 - Bee: Okay.  I'll do it tomorrow

01/09/2020, 21:04 - Bee: Bye Nischal
01/09/2020, 21:04 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about your walk
01/09/2020, 21:25 - Nischal Abraham: https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-restore-your-chat-history/?lang=en
01/09/2020, 21:26 - Nischal Abraham: It seems this one says to uninstall and reinstall as well. Make sure you're using the same google account
02/09/2020, 07:08 - Bee: I followed the steps here... it shows that there is 1GB of backup but it doesn't get restored
02/09/2020, 07:08 - Bee: I will get over it in a day
02/09/2020, 07:11 - Bee: I should click more mental photos instead of relying on this
02/09/2020, 07:50 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/09/2020, 07:50 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal :)

02/09/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry it didn't work out 😔. I'm sure you had many conversations you'd want to keep
02/09/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay. Clean slate for new memories right? That's how I usually console myself
02/09/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
02/09/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/Zf5rKTCMNnU
02/09/2020, 10:47 - Bee: I did...but like you said, clean slate for new memories 😊
02/09/2020, 10:47 - Bee: Oh. Good thing you went out yesterday... how cold is it? Perfect weather to snuggle inside the duvet
02/09/2020, 10:48 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/09/2020, 10:49 - Bee: This phone's camera is amazing Nischal.
02/09/2020, 10:49 - Bee: I'm apologizing in advance for the numerous photos that I'm going to send 😂
02/09/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: Apology accepted 😂. That does look like a really good photograph. I guess I should apologise for my poor quality photos then
02/09/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: It is. But after that video I just sent you... I can't be doing that right now
02/09/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: Watching*
02/09/2020, 11:25 - Bee: Motivated you to be productive? I should watch it before I continue studying then
02/09/2020, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it did. Well it's half an hour long so watch it during your break... It's a talk by a person I've been a fan of for a while so I may be biased to be inspired by it 😅
02/09/2020, 13:05 - Bee: Finished my nap. I'll watch it on my next break
02/09/2020, 13:05 - Bee: How's your day going?
02/09/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Been good! Going downstairs to heat up some Dal khichdi now. How about you? Made good progress?
02/09/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Made okay progress...kinda hard studying at home. Will stay up tonight
02/09/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: So what other plans do you have for today?
02/09/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: How's the new phone?
02/09/2020, 13:52 - Bee: No plans. Trying to study how much I can
02/09/2020, 13:53 - Bee: I'll need time to get used to the size... but I'm loving it
02/09/2020, 13:53 - Bee: Haven't had to worry about the memory filling up
02/09/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: How much memory does this one have?
02/09/2020, 14:25 - Bee: This one has 64GB

02/09/2020, 14:33 - Bee: What's up?
02/09/2020, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh double the size. I'm relaxing now. Cloudy afternoon after lunch. Are you on a break?
02/09/2020, 14:37 - Bee: Taking an unintentional break. I will have to go to college tomorrow or day after to submit assignments and pick up my hall ticket... so our teacher is giving us instructions
02/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Exams feel more real now Nischal. I'm scared.
02/09/2020, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God they're happening!
02/09/2020, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: What are you scared of?
02/09/2020, 14:43 - Nischal Abraham: Are these assignments you've finished already?
02/09/2020, 14:56 - Bee: I'm not prepared
02/09/2020, 14:56 - Bee: Yes...all completed
02/09/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: You've got time :). Just keep at it Bee!! There's a 1000 prayers and the God of eternity on your side
02/09/2020, 15:11 - Bee: Yes I've got time. Lack of motivation is the problem. I know you're pray6for me, Nischal. Please continue praying...which I know you will.
02/09/2020, 15:11 - Bee: Praying for*

03/09/2020, 09:26 - Bee: Hi Nischal :)
03/09/2020, 09:27 - Bee: Morning was alright. Cooked chicken for lunch along with Jason as a way to de-stress. It worked
03/09/2020, 09:27 - Bee: What're your plans for the day?
03/09/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
03/09/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds nice! What did you make?
03/09/2020, 10:12 - Bee: Chicken curry with soya chunks. Followed mummy's recipe to the T and yet it was nothing like hers. How do mothers do that?!
03/09/2020, 10:13 - Bee: Looks like a busy day
03/09/2020, 10:14 - Bee: The speaker for today's Bible study is from Ireland
03/09/2020, 10:14 - Nischal Abraham: Years of experience
03/09/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: I try to make it busy so I'm not wasting away doing nothing 😶. I count it a win if I keep to even 30% of what I've written down
03/09/2020, 10:15 - Bee: I changed my keyboard to Google keyboard. It was Samsung keyboard earlier. Easier to use now
03/09/2020, 10:15 - Bee: You motivate me Nischal.
03/09/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Dad had told me. I don't think I know the person though. Daniel does, he's from northern Ireland it seems
03/09/2020, 10:16 - Bee: Oh
03/09/2020, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! I like Google keyboard as well. It's the easiest one to use and was on my phone by default
03/09/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... You're the reason I'm motivated myself ☺️
03/09/2020, 10:17 - Bee: And all of my regular words are saved so it is easier
03/09/2020, 10:18 - Bee: 😊🤗

03/09/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Btw my schedule is flexible. So don't think just cause you're free at a time I'm not we can't be talking later today
03/09/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Thank you. :) I will give you an update when we talk

05/09/2020, 19:54 - Bee: How are you?
05/09/2020, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright. Feel a lot like you actually. You must be going to bed already though 😅
05/09/2020, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just waiting for night to take me. Been too lethargic a day and I just want it to be over
05/09/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Or good morning for whenever you read this
05/09/2020, 20:12 - Bee: A lot longer me how?

05/09/2020, 20:15 - Bee: What have you planned for the rest of your night?
05/09/2020, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Eat dinner, then night routine. I finished the other marriage book last night

05/09/2020, 20:16 - Nischal Abraham: Aren't you sleeping? Tomorrow's Sunday

05/09/2020, 20:16 - Bee: Manhood and womanhood?
05/09/2020, 20:17 - Nischal Abraham: No no. The gospel centered marriage one
05/09/2020, 20:17 - Nischal Abraham: I already finished that before
05/09/2020, 20:17 - Bee: OH. The one with questions?
05/09/2020, 20:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
05/09/2020, 20:18 - Bee: Oh

05/09/2020, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: But I was supposed to get her number from Nikhil 😶
05/09/2020, 20:20 - Bee: Don't tell me her Instagram handle. I won't be able to control myself
05/09/2020, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'd be too awkward though. Wouldn't do anything about it
05/09/2020, 20:20 - Bee: 🙄
05/09/2020, 20:20 - Bee: You can send her memes
05/09/2020, 20:20 - Nischal Abraham: I won't tell you if I find her then 😂. But she'll probably be private and then I'll have to requesy
05/09/2020, 20:21 - Bee: Or what if she's into gaming
05/09/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Request*
05/09/2020, 20:21 - Bee: You can talk about that
05/09/2020, 20:21 - Bee: Do it!!!! And tell me what you find
05/09/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: I have 0 clue. Achu would know. He knows her

05/09/2020, 20:22 - Nischal Abraham: And it's never too late! You're clever and it's not your own strength that'll lead you through
05/09/2020, 20:23 - Bee: That's what I'm telling myself. It's never been me
05/09/2020, 20:23 - Nischal Abraham: Doubt that too. You have a better chance of that than I do. We'll see. All in due time
05/09/2020, 20:23 - Bee: Noooo all in one week

05/09/2020, 20:23 - Bee: Got the hint
05/09/2020, 20:24 - Bee: I'll ask Nidhi
05/09/2020, 20:24 - Nischal Abraham: You'll get there. Dad was joking that you and Becky will end up talking a lot
05/09/2020, 20:24 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :))))))))))))))))))

06/09/2020, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: 😱😱
06/09/2020, 12:18 - Bee: I'll just get her port wine after exams. She won't mind.
06/09/2020, 12:18 - Bee: I always make good points
06/09/2020, 12:18 - Bee: Except for the times I don't
06/09/2020, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: You'll bribe her with alcohol!!!!?? 😱😱😱
06/09/2020, 12:19 - Bee: When you put it like that...
06/09/2020, 12:19 - Bee: 🙄
06/09/2020, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'm beginning to think I don't even know you
06/09/2020, 12:19 - Bee: YES.

Phillipians 1:6

You had shared this verse to me on my birthday. I don't know if you remember but this is the verse I was praying over you back in 2018. Merin had asked us to pick a verse for your birthday and pray that for the year to come. It's incredible looking back and seeing how God's been fulfilling that prayer.

Bee, you have a heart of gold and a mind refined like silver. Compassionate, affectionate, thoughtful in word and deed. There are many times I wish my natural tendencies were more like yours. But it is our differences that really help me see how blessed God has been. To you for making you as you are in His image. And to me for allowing me to experience you.

I continue praying that verse for you Debby. And this year I get to do it with you. I know it's your birthday but I'm stealing your lines now cause it's so true.
"You have been the greatest gift to me apart from amazing grace"
06/09/2020, 12:21 - Bee: Thank you, nana. ❤️
06/09/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: I couldn't. My worship was at the same time
06/09/2020, 12:22 - Bee: Ohh
06/09/2020, 12:22 - Bee: It was short. It was nice
06/09/2020, 12:22 - Bee: The whole fam must have let out a sigh of relief after it all. No more suffering for aunty
06/09/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Time difference problems. That's good to hear. She'll never have suffering again 😊
06/09/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Yes!!!! I might even envy her.
06/09/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Sounds bad but yes
06/09/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Paul thought the same so don't feel bad about it
06/09/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: But while we are alive there is much to be done
06/09/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Yes
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Like getting married and having kids
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Jk.
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Like studies
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: So I'll chat with you later 😂
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Whaaaa 😂
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Okay
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Bye :))
06/09/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Byeee :)
06/09/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. Just checking in to see how you're doing. Have you been able to get much done today?
06/09/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Hey! I was just thinking about you
06/09/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Took a break. Just finished dinner. I'll continue now
06/09/2020, 16:56 - Bee: I did study... It's definitely not enough. But it's something
06/09/2020, 16:57 - Bee: I'm just doing question papers now
06/09/2020, 16:57 - Bee: How's your day going?
06/09/2020, 16:57 - Bee: What was for lunch?
06/09/2020, 16:57 - Bee: How are you?
06/09/2020, 16:57 - Bee: Did you stalk Becky?
06/09/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing alright. Had leftovers for lunch again. I need to finish them before they end up going bad
06/09/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Probably will make pasta for dinner now that I have milk
06/09/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: I was just thinking about you too! Glad to hear studies are going on well 😊. If there's anything I can help with just let me know
06/09/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: No... Her socials are private accounts so I'll need to add her in places. Which might be weird considering even Nikhil hasn't connected with her on there 😅
06/09/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Dal khichdi?
06/09/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Chicken and veggies
06/09/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Ooh it will be creamy 😋
06/09/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Oh
06/09/2020, 17:03 - Bee: That will be weird 😕
06/09/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't even know you could private Facebook! I should do that for mine 😮
06/09/2020, 17:06 - Bee: Is her name Rebecca Samuel
06/09/2020, 17:06 - Bee: Is Becky short for Rebecca
06/09/2020, 17:06 - Bee: I didn't know that either. But I don't have much on my Facebook
06/09/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Rebecca Rachel George
06/09/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: WAIT! DEBBY!!!
06/09/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: You aren't supposed to be stalking!!
06/09/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: 😑
06/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: 😇
06/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: Nidhi is her friend!!!!
06/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: On Facebook!!!!!
06/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: I will message her
06/09/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: 😑😑😑
06/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: I can't stalk anyway
06/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: It's a locked profile
06/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: No point looking up
06/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: So it's okay
06/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: How did you so easily tell me her name 🙄
06/09/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Good. Now stop procrastinating and do what you're supposed to be doing. I don't know what that is but I'm sure you do 😂
06/09/2020, 17:10 - Bee: I don't understand
06/09/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: I had to look it up in my chat history with my dad
06/09/2020, 17:10 - Bee: You know what I'm supposed to be doing
06/09/2020, 17:10 - Bee: But how come you told me??!!!!!
06/09/2020, 17:10 - Bee: !!!!
06/09/2020, 17:11 - Bee: She's beautiful
06/09/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Self control is a quality of the fruit of the spirit Debby. It's inside of you
06/09/2020, 17:11 - Bee: 😶
06/09/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Are you planning on staying up late?
06/09/2020, 17:15 - Bee: I hope to stay up late yes

06/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: You are far away
06/09/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: You sound like Nidhi 😶
06/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: This Nidhi sounds like an intelligent person
06/09/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh she is. I'll have to tell you about her on our next call I guess
06/09/2020, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: How long is your break for?
06/09/2020, 17:24 - Bee: 6 minutes more
06/09/2020, 17:24 - Bee: You must. I'll remind you

06/09/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't taken a break. But I'm not doing anything so I guess I was always on a break?
06/09/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: What's up with you? Done for the night?

06/09/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: How devious
06/09/2020, 19:23 - Bee: I won't get her drunk!!!
06/09/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Port wine isn't strong enough to get you drunk
06/09/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Next week this time I'll be chilling
06/09/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yes 😌. It'll be lovely. Enjoy your cake!
06/09/2020, 19:24 - Bee: I will do this next week
06/09/2020, 19:24 - Bee: And I will talk on the phone for hours
06/09/2020, 19:24 - Bee: I will
06/09/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Bye
06/09/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Bye! If you want a break to talk I'm here for you
06/09/2020, 20:25 - Bee: Nischal
06/09/2020, 20:26 - Bee: I can't do any more
06/09/2020, 20:26 - Bee: I'm going to sleep
06/09/2020, 20:31 - Bee: You're going rock climbing tomorrow! I'm excited for you. 😊
06/09/2020, 20:32 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
06/09/2020, 20:32 - Bee: Watts of love 💡
06/09/2020, 20:39 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I ended up having 2 servings of packet pasta and now I'm too full
06/09/2020, 20:40 - Nischal Abraham: I pray you enjoy good sleep and wake up energetic for studies tomorrow :)
07/09/2020, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Hope your day's been productive
07/09/2020, 11:16 - Bee: Hey!
07/09/2020, 11:16 - Bee: It's been an okay day
07/09/2020, 11:16 - Bee: Terrified about tomorrow.
07/09/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: You'll be alright Debby. You've been studying all these days
07/09/2020, 13:20 - Bee: It isn't enough
07/09/2020, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: Trust in what you've studied. What percentage would you say you have leftover?
07/09/2020, 13:42 - Bee: 50%
07/09/2020, 13:43 - Nischal Abraham: Oh
07/09/2020, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be fine Debby! Hang in there!!
07/09/2020, 13:45 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/09/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Pray for me okay
07/09/2020, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely Bee!
07/09/2020, 13:52 - Bee: ❤️
07/09/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: The best way to be hanging in there 😊
07/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: Bb
07/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: Hi
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: What's up?
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Walking. Are you on a break?
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Oh. Just finishing a break
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Rock climbing!!!!!!
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Bye!!!!!
07/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Sorry I forgot
07/09/2020, 17:10 - Bee: 👋🏾
07/09/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay 😊. Hope you had a good study session
07/09/2020, 20:46 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about the memories you're making 😊
07/09/2020, 20:48 - Bee: Would've loved to pray with you before exams. But I forgot about rock climbing. It's okay. We'll pray by ourselves until we don't
07/09/2020, 20:48 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
07/09/2020, 22:54 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely praying for you! What time is your exam? You'll probably be done with it by the time I'm up in the morning so like all matters where distance is too great, I'll trust that God is going to carry you through
07/09/2020, 22:56 - Nischal Abraham: Although I may be sleeping, He who watches over Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps. And that same God is Lord over our lives Debby. Isn't that amazing! Fear God and everything else will seem as harmless as butterflies
07/09/2020, 22:57 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to hearing how it goes. Even if it isn't what you expect it to be I hope you'll find joy through it
07/09/2020, 22:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to pray with you after this paper since I can't do it before 😊. Hopefully I'll be around before the next one
07/09/2020, 22:59 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning and go slay(as the kids say these days)! 😂
08/09/2020, 01:10 - Bee: Hi
08/09/2020, 04:45 - Bee: It is from 11 to 2
08/09/2020, 16:20 - Bee: Hi Nischal
08/09/2020, 16:20 - Bee: It was difficult. A lot of unexpected questions which were never asked before
08/09/2020, 16:20 - Bee: I attempted everything... But don't know if I'll score
08/09/2020, 16:23 - Bee: Kids don't say that Nischal
08/09/2020, 16:23 - Bee: I don't know which kids you're talking about
08/09/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. My mom always said never leave a question empty. It makes it difficult for the teacher to help you 😉
08/09/2020, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: No? By kids I meant teens
08/09/2020, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: What's done is done. Focus on the next one I'd say 😊
08/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Yes. I'd say that too
08/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I'm saying that already
08/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Thanks man
08/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: What's up?
08/09/2020, 18:14 - Bee: How's your day going?
08/09/2020, 18:14 - Bee: What did you do today?
08/09/2020, 18:14 - Bee: How was rock climbing?
08/09/2020, 18:14 - Bee: And spending time with the lads? 😊
08/09/2020, 18:15 - Bee: What did you have for lunch?
What's for dinner?
08/09/2020, 18:15 - Bee: I miss you Nischal
08/09/2020, 18:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>

08/09/2020, 18:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: 🥺
08/09/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too Bee. I'm saving up the stories for after your exams are through. Though other than yesterday I don't think there'll be many more stories to share on my part
08/09/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Spoke to parents. Got caught up in chess for too long 😞. I remember why I stopped playing online now
08/09/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Lunch was leftover pasta. Dinner will be oats since the bananas will go overripe if I don't eat them up
08/09/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: How was the rest of your day?
08/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: What about your 4 years of college
08/09/2020, 18:38 - Bee: What nana. No more chess then? Or limited chess? Better if no more chess no? At least for me. I have poor self control
08/09/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Pasta with milk? That one?
08/09/2020, 18:39 - Bee: I came back, took a shower, had lunch, and slept. Woke up around 7:30 for prayer meeting. Had dinner. Talked with the fam for a bit, now trying to study
08/09/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Every gif is literally me rn okay
08/09/2020, 18:48 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yea no more chess. I have poor self control too 😞
08/09/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Custom made pasta is much better 😂. Made it with sausages
08/09/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!!! If you're supposed to be studying stop gif searching!
08/09/2020, 18:53 - Bee: I am studying
08/09/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Send me a gif no
08/09/2020, 18:54 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: No... Study with your phone aside Debby. But glad to see you happy 😊
08/09/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 18:58 - Bee: I meant a cute gif but okay
08/09/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Bye
08/09/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 20:27 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal!
08/09/2020, 20:28 - Bee: This is a cute gif?
08/09/2020, 20:29 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 20:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/09/2020, 20:30 - Bee: Okay bye nana
08/09/2020, 21:07 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Sorry I haven't been very active in responding today. I'm really not good at finding GIFs so you'll have to forgive me for that one
08/09/2020, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day's been lovely. Looking forward to times we can talk again 😌
09/09/2020, 04:51 - Bee: It's okay nana. My demands are unreasonable at times
09/09/2020, 04:51 - Bee: I'm looking forward too. :)
09/09/2020, 04:51 - Bee: Can you pray with me tonight?
09/09/2020, 04:51 - Bee: Before your Bible study
09/09/2020, 04:52 - Bee: Short call
09/09/2020, 05:00 - Bee: Good morning for when your read this 😊
09/09/2020, 05:01 - Bee: I hope you have a productive day. And that you finish whatever you've planned. And eat good food. Or something that you haven't tried before
09/09/2020, 09:10 - Bee: Nischal
09/09/2020, 10:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I planned to do so 😊
09/09/2020, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon to you!
09/09/2020, 10:03 - Bee: Can I call you for a minute
09/09/2020, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sure
09/09/2020, 10:07 - Nischal Abraham: That was 4 minutes!!
09/09/2020, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Okay bye. Enjoy lunch! I'll go have breakfast
09/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Nischal
09/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: I'm sleepy now
09/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: I want to sleep for a few hours
09/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: What time are you going to go to sleep?
09/09/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be up for a while. The prayer meeting usually ends by 10 so I won't be sleeping anytime before my 11pm
09/09/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Do you want to make a quick call now?
09/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Or after my nap? It will be motivation for me to wake up on time
09/09/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Are you planning on staying up at night?
09/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Are you having dinner before  Bible study?
09/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Yes
09/09/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
09/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: And sleep on the way to the exam centre. Can't study in the car
09/09/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: So what time do you want to get on a call?
09/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Is your 10:30 okay?
09/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: My 3?
09/09/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I hope that's okay with you too... Don't tire yourself out on the day of an exam 🙁
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: It is okay with me... I'm not able to study rn. I want to sleep
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be here at your 3am. Talk to you then!
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: And I will wake up by 3
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal.
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee ☺️. Praying you get plenty of rest even though the hours aren't many
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I will
09/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Bye. :)
09/09/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Enjoy dinner. And Bible study
09/09/2020, 18:47 - Bee: And prayer meeting
09/09/2020, 18:47 - Bee: :)
09/09/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Bye! I will 😊
09/09/2020, 22:32 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Bee! I'm free whenever you're up
09/09/2020, 22:42 - Bee: Hi Nischal
09/09/2020, 22:42 - Bee: I'm free
09/09/2020, 22:43 - Bee: I'll call?
09/09/2020, 22:43 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
09/09/2020, 22:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
10/09/2020, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: How was the exam? Hope it went well!
10/09/2020, 10:02 - Nischal Abraham: I also wanted to ask about something. If you're busy and can't do it that's okay, but it's my dad's birthday tomorrow and I was asking (very few) people to record a video wishing him and maybe saying something like we did for your birthday
10/09/2020, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: By very few I mean it's us 3 siblings... But mom said it'll be nice to have you and Becky also chip in. I know you're busy with studies so only do it if you have time
10/09/2020, 10:03 - Nischal Abraham: Alternatively you could send a message and I'll use that instead
10/09/2020, 11:06 - Bee: Hi Nischal! :)
10/09/2020, 11:06 - Bee: It went well :) ☺️
10/09/2020, 11:06 - Bee: Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
10/09/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yay!!
10/09/2020, 11:06 - Bee: How much time do I have?
10/09/2020, 11:07 - Bee: Should I make a funny one?
10/09/2020, 11:07 - Bee: Is there anything I can do?
10/09/2020, 11:08 - Bee: You can ask more people na
10/09/2020, 11:08 - Bee: Joji uncle and Julie aunty? Ranjit bhaiyya Linnet Didi and kids?
10/09/2020, 11:09 - Bee: Achu?
10/09/2020, 11:09 - Bee: No?
10/09/2020, 11:09 - Bee: How's your day going?
10/09/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: There was ideas to ask many people but it's all too last minute and I don't think I'll have the time to do a fair job of it
10/09/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: So I'm saving up ideas for next year now
10/09/2020, 11:21 - Bee: Oh
10/09/2020, 11:21 - Bee: You can add photos
10/09/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: This is do plan on doing
10/09/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: If you could send it by tonight that'll be awesome
10/09/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Ahhhhh
10/09/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Noted. I will
10/09/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: Anything you want 😂. With my poor editing skills it may end up being funny even if you want it to be serious
10/09/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Are you 3 just speaking about uncle?
10/09/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Hahahahaha
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: I was thinking about the sweatshirt and sunglasses one
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: But that's too much for the first time ya
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: You can study for your next exam 😁
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: That side will be revealed after 5 years
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Other than that?
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: What are you going to use for editing?
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: You must be having a video editor on your laptop
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Oh actually!! What do you use for editing?
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: It's called Video editor
10/09/2020, 11:23 - Bee: This
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Type it into your search bar
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: It's easy to use
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: I have a very basic editing thingy where I can copy and paste and clip audio/video
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Yes that's the one
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: You can add music and all
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: You can add photos also
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'll check it out. I usually use Shotcut
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Oh I don't know about that one
10/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Check Video editor
10/09/2020, 11:25 - Bee: ?
10/09/2020, 11:25 - Bee: You could do an interview kinda thing
10/09/2020, 11:26 - Bee: It's just an idea
10/09/2020, 11:26 - Bee: Maybe like
Somebody asking a question about uncle out loud (maybe Becky could do it?)
And then videos of you 4 answering
And then the next
Like that
10/09/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Funniest memory
One quality of his that you wish to have
Something like that
10/09/2020, 11:29 - Bee: I will look for more questions of you're doing this. Let me know
10/09/2020, 11:29 - Bee: If*
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Those sound like great ideas... I don't know if I have the time to do it though. Everyone's just been really busy and it's taking a lot just for us to get messages out
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: Oh
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: Next year then
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: :)
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: We can start a month early
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: Enough time for it all
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for the suggestion Debby. I'm sure you'd be amazing at planning these things
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep! That sounds like a plan
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: I am
10/09/2020, 11:31 - Bee: 😂
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Bee: Jk.
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Bee: Almost amazing
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: No really
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: You would be
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: I just know I'm going to crash tomorrow after having to message people today. My social battery is going to be drained to 0 by the end of the day
10/09/2020, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: And that's interaction with Nidhi, Nikhil and Mom!!!
10/09/2020, 11:33 - Bee: Just make a group na
10/09/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not cut out for this stuff 😶
10/09/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: OH! That sounds so obvious now that you say it
10/09/2020, 11:33 - Bee: You can make one now. Will be easier to coordinate
10/09/2020, 11:33 - Bee: It'll take time
10/09/2020, 11:34 - Bee: You sound like Nidhi
10/09/2020, 11:34 - Bee: Merin
10/09/2020, 11:34 - Bee: Reenee
10/09/2020, 11:34 - Bee: Me
10/09/2020, 11:34 - Bee: All of us 😛
10/09/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: What? I haven't heard you say that ever
10/09/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: Though I can imagine the rest of us
10/09/2020, 11:51 - Bee: I didn't talk to any of you the Sunday after our Delhi trip
10/09/2020, 11:51 - Bee: There's Bible study
10/09/2020, 11:53 - Bee: Nischal. So sweet of aunty to include me. I'm deeply touched.
10/09/2020, 11:55 - Nischal Abraham: Yea mom wanted to include both you and Becky. But from what I've gathered from Nidhi, Becky may not have anything to share... Which is fair enough considering she and my dad have had a total of 1 phone call together I think
10/09/2020, 14:28 - Bee: Nischal
10/09/2020, 14:28 - Bee: I'm sending the video on the group
10/09/2020, 14:28 - Bee: I think I'm a little too awkward. Let me know if you'd like me to redo it
10/09/2020, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Can't be more awkward than I would be 😅. Thanks again for taking time out for this Debby
10/09/2020, 14:34 - Bee: Also, recorded it right after my nap... 😶
10/09/2020, 14:34 - Bee: :). Anytime. Let me know if you need any help
10/09/2020, 14:35 - Bee: Did you find the video editing application
10/09/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: Your editing is epic as always Bee! All of our videos are gonna look subpar now 😢
10/09/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: Is it on the play store?
10/09/2020, 14:36 - Bee: No on your laptop
10/09/2020, 14:36 - Bee: Or you can use YouCut
10/09/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: OH... Is it the windows default one?
10/09/2020, 14:37 - Bee: This is what I used to add the words
You can also compile clips to make a single video
10/09/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't even know it existed till now 😮
10/09/2020, 14:37 - Bee: Yes
10/09/2020, 14:37 - Bee: Let me know if you need any help
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Or if you have doubts
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Man I feel more tech savvy than you
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. I don't have the bright idea for fancy text and all ya Debby... It'll just be plain me talking
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: The feeling won't last long I know.
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: You are!
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: That's wonderful too. It's the thought Nischal
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks. I'll probably get to that after the Bible study
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Biju uncle will love it
10/09/2020, 14:38 - Bee: Okay
10/09/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Hi bb
10/09/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Going okay?
10/09/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: 🙁
10/09/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Video stuff is hard. I feel like I understand my parents struggle with technology so much now
10/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Which application are you using?
10/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Did you get all the videos you wanted
10/09/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Windows Video Editor
10/09/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Just yours so far. I'll be recording mine after I take a shower
10/09/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Ookay
10/09/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Waiting to see the final video
10/09/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Nischal, pray for Ruthie ma
10/09/2020, 17:47 - Bee: She's exhausted mentally, physically, spiritually
10/09/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Her words
10/09/2020, 17:47 - Bee: She's got lots to do there
10/09/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Hardly getting any sleep
10/09/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: Will be praying. Must be difficult I'm sure
10/09/2020, 17:47 - Bee: Taking pain killers because terrible headache and body ache
10/09/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: How has your day been Debby?
10/09/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Pretty good I would say.
10/09/2020, 18:01 - Bee: I slept in the evening so I'll stay up for a while to study
10/09/2020, 18:01 - Bee: How's your day going?
10/09/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: The day's been alright but I feel overwhelmed although there's no logical reason I should
10/09/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Because of the video?
10/09/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Can I help you during my break?
10/09/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe that's a part of it... I don't want you to be spending your break time on this Bee. I am technically free and should be able to do it
10/09/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure you've got things you want to do during your break to wind down
10/09/2020, 18:04 - Bee: What else is overwhelming?
10/09/2020, 18:04 - Bee: I would just be reading Reddit posts or scrolling through Instagram Nischal
10/09/2020, 18:04 - Bee: It isn't much. I can do without it
10/09/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'd like the assistance. But I'm just winging it so I don't really know how to share the work when I don't even know what I'm doing yet
10/09/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know. Maybe nothing. But I just feel it
10/09/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Send all the photos and videos that you have. However it's convenient for you
10/09/2020, 18:07 - Bee: Have you had your quiet time?
10/09/2020, 18:08 - Bee: I will take a shower and revise for a bit. Will you be free in an hour and a half?
10/09/2020, 18:08 - Bee: We can do it then?
10/09/2020, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'll be free
10/09/2020, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take a shower and have dinner by then too
10/09/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Okay
10/09/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Not too early for dinner?
10/09/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: I did. In the morning. Feels so long ago right now
10/09/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Read a Psalm. Sing a hymn
10/09/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: By the time I'm done with a shower and prepare it'll be 7pm
10/09/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Okay
10/09/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll do that
10/09/2020, 18:10 - Bee: :)
10/09/2020, 18:10 - Bee: See you soon nana
10/09/2020, 19:36 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
10/09/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: How long is your break?
10/09/2020, 19:36 - Bee: 20ish minutes
10/09/2020, 19:37 - Bee: What do you want assistance with?
10/09/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Tell me!!
10/09/2020, 19:37 - Bee: How do we do this
10/09/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Sharing screens on zoom?
10/09/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Can I call?

11/09/2020, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How's your day going? Just checking in
11/09/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Hey
11/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Going okay. Pleasant weather here. Rained heavily today. Doesn't feel like exam weather. I don't feel like studying. But pushing myself to study
11/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: How's your day going?
11/09/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been similar to yours. Except I haven't been able to push myself to do anything so far
11/09/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Slept in the afternoon so now I'm feeling weird
11/09/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Are you on a break?
11/09/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Push yourself!!! You're not going to be 'motivated' all the time.
11/09/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Yes I am
11/09/2020, 15:31 - Bee: What are you supposed to be doing?
11/09/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Some health insurance thing? (I don't remember if it's insurance or something else)
Then the 2 job application things
11/09/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Split training?
11/09/2020, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly that
11/09/2020, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: That's later in the day. During exercise time
11/09/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Do it
11/09/2020, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: I've been trying to get on a call with dad but we keep missing each other
11/09/2020, 15:33 - Bee: Oh
11/09/2020, 15:33 - Bee: Birthday wishes must be
11/09/2020, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's what I figured as well
11/09/2020, 15:34 - Bee: Call Shirly aunty and then ask to give the phone to uncle!!! Then he can't decline maybe?
11/09/2020, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: I think they went somewhere I messaged Nidhi with the same intention but no replies
11/09/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Oh
11/09/2020, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just wait till later. Dad had called me in the afternoon but I was downstairs for lunch then
11/09/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Oh
11/09/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Later then
11/09/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Ask Nidhi to call whenever they're free no
11/09/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Then you don't have to wait
11/09/2020, 15:36 - Bee: And you can do this
11/09/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: I can do this even while waiting. They are laptop tasks. Call is on the phone
11/09/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Okay

11/09/2020, 16:48 - Bee: I'm proud of you. I know it's not because of you. All God. But I am proud of you.

11/09/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'll take the credit. And it's all God but I'm learning not to deflect. I'm trying to look at it as me putting in the effort and God honouring that I did
11/09/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Same goes for me
11/09/2020, 16:53 - Bee: I like that statement. You putting in the effort and His honouring that you did.

12/09/2020, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: I was almost certain you'd be turned 180 in the last pic considering the change of angle every year
12/09/2020, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
12/09/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing today. I need to be ready for the family call later which means trimming and showering early
12/09/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Sunday special?
12/09/2020, 14:54 - Bee: Hahaha

12/09/2020, 14:58 - Bee: Yes

12/09/2020, 14:59 - Bee: What was for lunch?

12/09/2020, 15:19 - Bee: Just found out that I have postings from Monday
12/09/2020, 15:20 - Bee: What else did you buy?
12/09/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Just refills. Nothing special this time
12/09/2020, 16:38 - Bee: Ahh
12/09/2020, 17:28 - Bee: In two minutes! Enjoy. ☺️
12/09/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yep! I'll let you know details
12/09/2020, 17:30 - Bee: 😊
12/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Nischal, requesting you to pray for mummy. She had a follow up appointment today. Chest X ray showed signs of congestion... Doc prescribed a CT scan. Reports will come on Monday... She may have to get admitted if the report is bad. Please pray for her... I'm sorry if I interrupted... But it's heavy on my heart. Just wanted to tell you. Goodnight. :)
12/09/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee... Sorry I didn't reply earlier. I was still in the call

12/09/2020, 21:18 - Bee: Too many unwanted thoughts. I'll tell you whenever we talk next.
12/09/2020, 21:18 - Bee: How's your prep for tomorrow going?
12/09/2020, 21:19 - Nischal Abraham: Difficult. I'm still not very sure what I should talk about
12/09/2020, 21:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying you get sleep
12/09/2020, 21:31 - Bee: I'm praying for you to have clarity regarding what God wants to speak through you
12/09/2020, 21:32 - Nischal Abraham: :)
13/09/2020, 08:45 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Hope worship was a great time 😊. How's your heart doing?
13/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Hey :)
13/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Worship was a great time but I wasn't focussed throughout 😞
13/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Heart is still heavy
13/09/2020, 12:24 - Bee: How was worship?
13/09/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: It was lovely. Had a great time
13/09/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Do you want to talk today?
13/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: If you're free
13/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: All stupid thoughts Nischal
13/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Waste of time
13/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Will have to be a short call though. I've got clinicals from tomorrow
13/09/2020, 13:33 - Nischal Abraham: You may consider them to be stupid but I think there's validity to all thoughts
13/09/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Would it be better for you to skip a call today? That's alright with mr
13/09/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Me*
13/09/2020, 13:48 - Bee: Yes. I'm not sure if I can make it despite scheduling a call
13/09/2020, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay Debby. Do you have a lot planned for today?
13/09/2020, 13:54 - Bee: Not much. Going to take a long shower. Then I have to prep for tomorrow. My uniform and other articles I'll need. Don't know where stuff is. Been too long
13/09/2020, 13:54 - Bee: How's your day going, Nischal?
13/09/2020, 13:55 - Bee: How are you?
13/09/2020, 13:55 - Bee: What was for lunch?
13/09/2020, 13:55 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
13/09/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: It's been like every other Sunday so far
13/09/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: My heart feels heavy for you
13/09/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Chapatti and egg curry
13/09/2020, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Exercise and prayer are the only planned parts
13/09/2020, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Otherwise it's a very uneventful day
13/09/2020, 15:34 - Bee: I'm feeling better now, Nischal. I'll get over it. Please don't worry about me
13/09/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Ooh. You cooked?
13/09/2020, 15:38 - Bee: I _might_ not have postings tomorrow. I'll let you know by 10:30? Can we talk if you're free around 11:30ish?
13/09/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free anytime of the day Bee. Just give me a half an hour heads up
13/09/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Gracious offerings by Ciba
13/09/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm still going to worry about you. It won't be crippling me from doing other stuff though
13/09/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: I am glad you're feeling better :)
13/09/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Okay. I will let you know
13/09/2020, 15:43 - Bee: That's sweet. A mum-cooked lunch
13/09/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Okay. What stuff are you doing?
13/09/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: It always is lovely 😊
13/09/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: Watching 'This is Us' now
13/09/2020, 17:15 - Bee: Ayyy when did you start?!
13/09/2020, 17:15 - Bee: What's happening in the episode you're on?
13/09/2020, 17:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/09/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Because of the soya sauce
13/09/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: It looks like I'd want to eat it 😋
13/09/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'm in S1 E5. Just started again today
13/09/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Not*
13/09/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Oh. I haven't finished season 4. Stopped watching because it made me cry too much. But I want to finish it. Don't know when
13/09/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: Should I add it to the list?
13/09/2020, 17:54 - Bee: It'll take a long time ya
13/09/2020, 17:55 - Bee: But sure. I don't think I'm going to watch it anytime soon
13/09/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm still on season 1. And it doesn't look like a show I can binge anyway
13/09/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Is 11:15 okay?
13/09/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Your 6:45
13/09/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep 😊
13/09/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Cool. Add it to the list 😊
13/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
13/09/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free
13/09/2020, 18:50 - Bee: I'll call?
13/09/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
14/09/2020, 10:14 - Bee: Good morning, bb
14/09/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Happy 1 year in Ireland ☺️
14/09/2020, 10:16 - Bee: Also, officially a year since we last met
14/09/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! I got up very late today. Just finished with breakfast
14/09/2020, 10:21 - Nischal Abraham: Happy 1 year anniversary of us having met 😂. Though it doesn't feel very happy to me
14/09/2020, 10:26 - Bee: Why hurry
14/09/2020, 10:26 - Bee: Is that a countdown app?
14/09/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Yep. Doesn't feel happy. But it is a reason to celebrate and be thankful for. We've made it so far. 😊
14/09/2020, 10:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I found it for our Delhi trip
14/09/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Ahhh
14/09/2020, 10:27 - Bee: I thought you used countdown widget
14/09/2020, 10:27 - Bee: One of you told me about countdown widget. Must've been Ruth
14/09/2020, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: I guess I've been using it before the Delhi trip as well 😂
14/09/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: There were more that I've deleted. Train pass hasn't been updated since I didn't need to renew it
14/09/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: I think I actually found it for the Pune trip to B&E
14/09/2020, 10:30 - Bee: This is cool ya. Mine doesn't show the past countdowns
14/09/2020, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: It's a nice app! And it has a widget too so you can add that to your home screen
14/09/2020, 10:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 10:30 - Bee: I will check it out
14/09/2020, 10:31 - Nischal Abraham: Woah with a flag and all 😮
14/09/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: The Evernote pin ☺️
14/09/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: It is indeed! Thank God for all these days 😁
14/09/2020, 10:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 10:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 10:33 - Bee: 😊
14/09/2020, 10:33 - Bee: Yes that was the day I found out the Irish and Indian flags have the same colors
14/09/2020, 10:45 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! What widget do you use for the weather?
14/09/2020, 11:12 - Bee: It is an in-built widget
14/09/2020, 11:12 - Bee: I don't know if that's the answer
14/09/2020, 11:12 - Bee: I will check
14/09/2020, 11:13 - Bee: The weather app is an in built one
14/09/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: Ah thanks. I don't have an in built one so I wondered if you were using an app
14/09/2020, 11:44 - Bee: Nope
14/09/2020, 11:44 - Bee: Postings from tomorrow. Trains from Thane to panvel aren't running
14/09/2020, 11:45 - Bee: I'll be staying with a couple friends of mine in kharghar
14/09/2020, 11:45 - Bee: Relieved to have found this option
14/09/2020, 11:45 - Bee: Now I'm not sure if I should go today or tomorrow
14/09/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: Staying over at a friend's place? Sounds fun! How long is your postings for? Will you be back on the weekend?
14/09/2020, 11:49 - Nischal Abraham: Or are you going to stay on for a while?
14/09/2020, 12:12 - Bee: Postings for two weeks. After that practical exams
14/09/2020, 12:12 - Bee: I'll be there for two weeks at least
14/09/2020, 12:12 - Bee: I can come home for the weekend but travel will be a problem
14/09/2020, 12:34 - Nischal Abraham: Wasn't your driving test going to be this week?
14/09/2020, 12:35 - Bee: Yes. I asked them if it was possible to move it. They said yes. But the next available slot is in November. November 13th
14/09/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. But you have no other choice 🙁
14/09/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Yep. I've waited so long. Two more months is fine
14/09/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Praise God you have a place to stay in Debby. I still keep wondering how are others managing this stuff
14/09/2020, 12:42 - Bee: Only Thane - Panvel/Vashi/Nerul trains aren't running. The rest are
14/09/2020, 12:43 - Bee: My classmates are sorted. I don't know about others working in the harbour line tho
14/09/2020, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: How unfortunate. Or I guess fortunate since you get to stay over?
14/09/2020, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: How do you feel about the whole thing?
14/09/2020, 12:46 - Bee: Fortunate that I don't have to travel from Thane to Kurla and then to Panvel from there
Fortunate because maa doesn't have to prepare dabba for me. Too many people to cook for already
Fortunate that I'll save time and energy on travel 
Fortunate that I'll have a little more space for a few days
14/09/2020, 12:46 - Bee: I'm okay with it. Happy even
14/09/2020, 12:47 - Bee: I'm happy that the course is moving forward. Willing to go through any kinda trouble if it means I get to finish the course
14/09/2020, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds wonderful! 😁. I'm happy for you too 😊
14/09/2020, 13:10 - Bee: I am happy for me too
14/09/2020, 13:11 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
14/09/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: No plans. Late breakfast, just finished a movie, will go make rice now... Probably call my parents in the afternoon
14/09/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: What about you?
14/09/2020, 13:59 - Bee: Which movie?
14/09/2020, 14:00 - Bee: Paint my nails, pack, iron my uniform for tomorrow
14/09/2020, 14:00 - Bee: Nothing else planned
14/09/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Sneakers. Its an old movie that is sort of heist based. It's alright. Wouldn't watch it again
14/09/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: So you'll be going tomorrow then? How will you be going?
14/09/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Found out 30 minutes ago that no clinicals for me tomorrow. 14 students tomorrow and 14 day after. After that everyone everyday. My teacher always gives last minute notices
14/09/2020, 15:43 - Bee: I'll be going Wednesday onwards
14/09/2020, 15:43 - Bee: I'm excited Nischal
14/09/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Looking forward to interacting with patients and being out of the house for at least 8 hours a day
14/09/2020, 15:44 - Bee: :)
14/09/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: That does sound nice! Finally out doing stuff
14/09/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: So changed plans for today for you then?
14/09/2020, 16:02 - Bee: Yes. Packing is for tomorrow. I hate packing Nischal
14/09/2020, 16:03 - Bee: I put it off for as long as I can
14/09/2020, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Just finish it off today na. Then you don't have to bother about it tomorrow
14/09/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Hmm. You make sense. I don't want to make sense.
14/09/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Fine. I shall pack
14/09/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: There ya go. I only make sense to others. Never myself
14/09/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Almost done
14/09/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: You must be done by now
14/09/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day Bee?
14/09/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Yep. A few things to be added in. I've kept them aside. Will do it tomorrow
14/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: My day was alright. Uneventful. There was some back work that I did in the morning. Then helped Jason make a birthday card for Priya
14/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Nothing else
14/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: How's your day going?
14/09/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Been a lazy one. I feel super tired today. Didn't even exercise. Break in my streak already 😞
14/09/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: Will probably go to bed early tonight. How will Jason send the card?
14/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: No no no you've got time!!!!!!!!!
14/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: No breaks Nischal!!!!
14/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: You have to color it green.
14/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: It's only 6:45
14/09/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Well yea I just need to get my middle stretches done for the streak. But that's the most painful exercise to do
14/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: It's not even about exercising. You'll feel terrible if you take a break
14/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: It will get less painful with each day
14/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: You know if
14/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: It*
14/09/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Okay okay I'll do it. I think it only gets less painful when I've reached 180°
14/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: 😂
14/09/2020, 18:46 - Bee: And then you can show off
14/09/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Ruth will have more to learn from you
14/09/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Why Ruth? She wants to do a middle split?
14/09/2020, 18:48 - Bee: No. But she may want to once she knows that you can do it
14/09/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. Well there's a certain book she's yet to read that I've finished
14/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: That's gonna take a looong time
14/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: You may achieve this by the time she finishes it
14/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Or maybe she already did 🤷🏾‍♀️
14/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: It's possible. Not going to bed?
14/09/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/YfUNU-sPwbQ
14/09/2020, 18:58 - Bee: In 15. I'm watching curly hair care routines. Mesmerising
14/09/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Bagpipes?
14/09/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Okay?
14/09/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yep!
14/09/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Sent you one on Instagram
14/09/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Cool
14/09/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Is it odd I didn't see a difference in before and after 😶
14/09/2020, 19:04 - Bee: The before wasn't a before. It was just an after but shown during the beginning
14/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. Then I'm glad it wasn't just another guy thing to do 😂
14/09/2020, 19:05 - Bee: What? The whole curly hair routine?
14/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. The not noticing a difference in hair
14/09/2020, 19:05 - Bee: I want to try it on yours when your hair grows longer
14/09/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Ahhhh. Nope it wasn't
14/09/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Mines wavier than that though. Not so curly
14/09/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 19:18 - Bee: It works for wavy hair too. The waves will be more defined that's all
14/09/2020, 19:18 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/09/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: That new phone camera really defines your details Debby.
14/09/2020, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: And here I am trying to find ways to less define the waves
14/09/2020, 19:20 - Bee: 🤣🤣
14/09/2020, 19:20 - Bee: You can get a haircut after
14/09/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Well I wouldn't if it looks good. Considering my hair care is at 1% right now I think anything done to it would be an improvement
14/09/2020, 19:22 - Bee: You'll grow your hair out?!
14/09/2020, 19:22 - Bee: We'll do hair masks and all that shizz. Your hair care will be at a 100.
14/09/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Bb, goodnight!
14/09/2020, 19:31 - Bee: 🤗
14/09/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! It has been a most wonderful year
15/09/2020, 09:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/09/2020, 10:04 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Thanks 😊
15/09/2020, 10:04 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day's going well! What've you been up to?
15/09/2020, 10:10 - Bee: Went to the bank again. Fried fish. Made coconut chocolate bars for Ashley's birthday. One batch got burnt. Threw myself a pity party. Doing rest of the packing now
15/09/2020, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: Coconut chocolate bars sounds luxurious
15/09/2020, 10:11 - Nischal Abraham: You'll put Bounty out of business
15/09/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Nischal, I wrote you a letter expecting that mail to Ireland is accepted now. But it isn't. And it won't be open for a while. So there's a letter. Would you like me to send images of it? Or mail it whenever things open up? Up to you. I'll still keep it safe and give it to you whenever we meet
15/09/2020, 10:12 - Bee: It has a biscuit base and condensed milk too
15/09/2020, 10:12 - Bee: Not quite like Bounty. But did you read the part about one batch getting burnt? The other one is fine. So Ashley has some sweet for today
15/09/2020, 10:12 - Nischal Abraham: I can be patient for it. I'd like to read the letter and not images of it if that's alright with you
15/09/2020, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure he'll eat the burnt ones also 😂
15/09/2020, 10:13 - Bee: Okay. I'll mail it to you whenever things open up 😊 I wish I had your patience
15/09/2020, 10:14 - Nischal Abraham: So will you be leaving today or tomorrow?
15/09/2020, 10:14 - Bee: 😂 I don't doubt it
15/09/2020, 10:14 - Bee: Today. Around 4
15/09/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh that's soon. Praying for your postings Debby! And I hope you have a fun time away. It sounds like a really long sleepover again
15/09/2020, 11:38 - Bee: It is a really long sleepover. Where we'll be cooking ourselves
15/09/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: So it's a camping trip then
15/09/2020, 14:15 - Bee: I reached
15/09/2020, 14:15 - Bee: I DROVE ALL THE WAY TO KHARGHAR
15/09/2020, 14:18 - Bee: Got scared and stuck at the Kalwa junction for a minute. But that's all. The rest of the drive was smooth
15/09/2020, 14:19 - Bee: 💃🏾
15/09/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: THAT'S AWESOME!!! 😮. Good going Debby. Glad to hear you've reached safely. Have fun!
15/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: My beloved teacher just told us (the 14 who weren't called to the hospital today) that we have to go to college tomorrow and day after.
15/09/2020, 15:32 - Bee: She's the one who 'taught' us the subject Management of Nursing Services and Education. Just a little upset.
15/09/2020, 15:32 - Bee: 😠
15/09/2020, 15:34 - Bee: I will have fun. Saving a lot of time with no travel. Don't know what to do with all of the time I have now
15/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: So no posting for two more days?
15/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: Is the college close to where you're staying?
15/09/2020, 15:55 - Bee: College is in Vashi. Yes it is close. I could've stayed home for two more days
15/09/2020, 15:55 - Bee: Nope
15/09/2020, 15:56 - Bee: I don't know why but I'm feeling homesick. Quite funny
15/09/2020, 15:56 - Bee: I'm not even that far away
15/09/2020, 15:56 - Bee: 🤷🏾‍♀️
15/09/2020, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: Must be the possibility of having been home. But either way it's fine right? If you had postings you'd have to be there so now you get two days to adjust without stress 😌
15/09/2020, 16:09 - Bee: Yes, either way is fine 😊
15/09/2020, 16:12 - Bee: How's your day going?
15/09/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: It's a slow day. I feel full all the time and only eat because I should. Thinking of starting more streaks to force productivity but I don't want to burn out either
15/09/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Such a predicament
15/09/2020, 17:15 - Bee: Maybe start one more streak? And see how it goes
15/09/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yes I guess. How's your first night?
15/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Pretty good I would say. We made Dal, rice, potato vegetable, and chapattis for dinner
15/09/2020, 17:37 - Bee: There are 4 of us here. One of us (Sneha) has a few food preferences. Not sure how it'll play out in the days to come
15/09/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Well I pray it'll be alright 😊
15/09/2020, 18:26 - Bee: :)
15/09/2020, 18:27 - Bee: My sleep schedule is going to be on point
15/09/2020, 18:27 - Bee: I'm tired and in bed already! Haven't gone to sleep this early in a looonnngg time
15/09/2020, 18:27 - Bee: What's up?
15/09/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'm tired too but won't be going to bed for a while
15/09/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Doing nothing is always exhausting
15/09/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: That's good considering you'll be on postings right? Early sleep and early rising
15/09/2020, 18:59 - Bee: That is good
15/09/2020, 19:00 - Bee: What plans until sleep time?
15/09/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Exercise streak?
15/09/2020, 19:00 - Bee: What about the health insurance thing? All done?
15/09/2020, 19:00 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
15/09/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Finish up exercising. Take a shower. Eat dinner. Watch some This is Us. Read and sleep
15/09/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Almost. Just need to make the final payment. I've transferred money to my Irish account which just arrived
15/09/2020, 19:01 - Bee: What are you gonna read? Started a new book?
15/09/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Oh
15/09/2020, 19:01 - Bee: What's for dinner?
15/09/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Too many questions?
15/09/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright. A bit directionless. Finding it hard to motivate myself
15/09/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Motivate yourself for?
15/09/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Picked up Shadow of the Almighty again. Maybe this time I'll finish it 😂
15/09/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Wrap, cheese, egg, mayo
15/09/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Not if you don't mind my rate of delayed answers
15/09/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Ooh. How far have you reached? How many pages to go?
15/09/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Anything more than lying down on my bed watching YT videos
15/09/2020, 19:03 - Bee: I don't
15/09/2020, 19:03 - Bee: Oh. Are there things you could be doing instead?
15/09/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Just started again last night. So I stared rereading the last chapter I left off at
15/09/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Apply for more jobs. Do some side projects. Fix up my portfolio online
15/09/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Study a bit more. Study the Bible. Pray.
15/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Arrange my hard drive
15/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Clean out my phone
15/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Connect with people I haven't spoken to in some time
15/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: There's always better things to do than watch YouTube videos all day
15/09/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: All day is not an exaggeration. Which is why it's a problem
15/09/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Make a plan. Are you doing that?
15/09/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Like this one
15/09/2020, 19:09 - Bee: Every hour planned
15/09/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Send it to someone you can be accountable to. Ask them to keep checking in. I could be the one if you want. If you're comfortable
15/09/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I did today. Didn't end up following it
15/09/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Oh
15/09/2020, 19:10 - Bee: .
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: It's hard to be motivated when you can get away with not doing anything
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: By you I mean me
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: But you're not getting away Nischal
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Understood
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Not understood
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Everything has its consequent
15/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Wait no
15/09/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Consequences*
15/09/2020, 19:12 - Bee: Every minute you spend today watching YT videos (unless it's during a break) is time lost forever
15/09/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Unless it's helping you finish what you've planned for the day
15/09/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Which I doubt
15/09/2020, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Your doubt is valid. My videos for today was Pokémon games
15/09/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Hmm.
15/09/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: I know
15/09/2020, 19:14 - Bee: We can't sit and pray for something but not do anything about it
15/09/2020, 19:15 - Bee: One of my biggest pushes during nursing were all of the people who lifted me up in prayer. How can I not do my bit when so many are praying for me?
15/09/2020, 19:15 - Bee: So many are praying for you, nana.
15/09/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Do this!!
15/09/2020, 19:15 - Bee: And this
15/09/2020, 19:15 - Bee: And this
15/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: And this
15/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: And this.
15/09/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: ~But what am I doing? It feels~ question answered 😶
15/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: What?
15/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: What was your question?
15/09/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: That's what I was just about to ask. But then you sent this
15/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Oh
15/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Okay
15/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: How's your night time routine going on?
15/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: It has 15 minutes of reflection right
15/09/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: Okay for the last 3 days. I reflect on how unproductive I've been and repeat it the next day
15/09/2020, 19:18 - Bee: What will you reflect tonight if you haven't done what you planned to? And what will you reflect on if you have? Which will be better?
15/09/2020, 19:18 - Bee: Okay
15/09/2020, 19:18 - Bee: Tell me if I'm being too hard on you. I will take a step back.
15/09/2020, 19:20 - Bee: I believe in you nana. I've learnt so much from you the past year. You make me want to try harder and be kinder.
You can do this. Anything you set your mind to. Begin with prayer. It will happen.
15/09/2020, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: No more than I've been on myself. I don't know the solution to this but words haven't been very long lasting
15/09/2020, 19:21 - Bee: You know the solution
15/09/2020, 19:21 - Bee: Solution to what?
15/09/2020, 19:21 - Bee: What words? Sorry I'm clueless.
15/09/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Solution to me making excuses at times when I should be doing something
15/09/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: And then only coming to my senses at night when I look back
15/09/2020, 19:22 - Bee: Isn't the solution getting up and doing it
15/09/2020, 19:22 - Nischal Abraham: It's what I would suggest to anyone else as well. Sounds like the perfect answer. But I know this already Debby
15/09/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing's changed knowing. At least not in the past is all I'm saying
15/09/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Don't worry about it Debby :). I'll figure it out
15/09/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Hmm. How can I help? Other than praying? Anything?
15/09/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: You've got things to deal with yourself
15/09/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Nischal, I am going to worry about you. I look forward to it. It's a gentle reminder of what we have. It makes me pray.
15/09/2020, 19:25 - Bee: But I am here for you.
15/09/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: I appreciate the prayers! It's what's keeping me afloat so far
15/09/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know what else. Not even from myself. Perhaps my prayers are still quite inadequate
15/09/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: I know Bee. And I for you. Regardless of how I can't push myself I'll always have the strength to push you 😁
15/09/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Which is very ironic that I can't do it to myself 😑
15/09/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm off to take a shower. Thank you for the talk 😌. Goodnight if I take longer than you're awake Bee!
15/09/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for your first of many nights and college for the next two days. Love you forever and always
15/09/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Push me off a cliff?
15/09/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Jk.
15/09/2020, 19:44 - Bee: The talk did nothing. It's just that it kills me (a slight exaggeration) when I look back and realize I've done nothing. I don't want you to feel that way. But all of us have such days (or hours). Please remember that your don't have to wait for the next day to start over. You can do or any moment during the day. Not giving you another talk. Sorry
15/09/2020, 19:45 - Bee: You finished your shower?
15/09/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
15/09/2020, 19:45 - Bee: That was quick
15/09/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Just
15/09/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Did your shower properly
15/09/2020, 19:45 - Bee: 😂
15/09/2020, 19:46 - Bee: You*
15/09/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: It's been 10 min. How long do you take?
15/09/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: I have much less hair to worry about
15/09/2020, 19:46 - Bee: 10 if I'm on a hurry. Hours if I've got the time
15/09/2020, 19:47 - Bee: In* 😠
15/09/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Are you not sleepy? I thought you'd be fast asleep by the time I was done
15/09/2020, 19:47 - Bee: I am sleepy
15/09/2020, 19:47 - Bee: I'll sleep now
15/09/2020, 19:48 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. ☺️
15/09/2020, 19:48 - Bee: Saying bye on text is hard too
15/09/2020, 19:48 - Bee: But what to do
15/09/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: You did right there
15/09/2020, 19:48 - Bee: 😒
15/09/2020, 19:48 - Bee: Bye. ♥️
15/09/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Byee! Goodnight again
16/09/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee, hope your day goes splendidly 😊
16/09/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Hey! My was alright. The work that we were told to do was too little for the time that was given. Most of the day went by doing almost nothing
16/09/2020, 12:23 - Bee: I hope your day goes splendidly too. :)
16/09/2020, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you had a good not busy day then
16/09/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Yep wasn't busy at all
16/09/2020, 13:00 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done for the day?
16/09/2020, 13:07 - Bee: I am. Have to go grocery shopping sometime later but that's all
16/09/2020, 13:08 - Bee: And Tijy will be arriving in a couple hours!!!!! She's the 4th one. I'm looking forward to staying with her again
16/09/2020, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: Who are the other two you're staying with?
16/09/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds exciting!
16/09/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Sneha - she's been living here for the past 4 years
Suseetha - Lives in Ambernath. She's from a Methodist assembly
16/09/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Tijy makes everything bearable. 😌
16/09/2020, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: What was the highlight of today?
16/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Brb
16/09/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! I'm glad you had a relaxed day. It must be exciting being able to stay with Tijy again 😊
16/09/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'm heading downstairs for dinner and you'll probably be in bed before I'm done so goodnight!! I hope you have another wonderful day tomorrow too!!
16/09/2020, 18:48 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for your tomorrow. Praying for your stay. Bye Bee! 😁
16/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Hi Nischal. The house was a little busy once Tijy arrived. There was an argument with the neighbor. I'll tell you whenever we talk
16/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. It's been good so far :)
16/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: How's your day going?
16/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: What's for dinner?
16/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Has it been a productive day so far?
16/09/2020, 19:12 - Bee: I miss you.
16/09/2020, 19:12 - Bee: I pray so. Continuing to pray. Now while I'm asleep but once I'm up
16/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: I'm 🍌🍌🍌🍌 about you.
16/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: I hope we get to talk more tomorrow and in the days to come. At least on text.
16/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Bye Nischal.
16/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Goodnight. 😊
16/09/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Hope it wasn't too bad
16/09/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: It was a good day today. Managed to send in 3 applications today 😊
16/09/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Your prayers are beautiful Debby
16/09/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: ☺️
16/09/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I hope we get to talk. But I shall wait patiently for when the time presents itself
17/09/2020, 07:58 - Bee: Ayyy, good job bb. :)
17/09/2020, 07:58 - Bee: Sorry man. Typo. 😛
17/09/2020, 07:59 - Bee: Not*
I know how to pray while asleep. Still learning how to pray while being awake
17/09/2020, 07:59 - Bee: Don't know****. Sheesh.
17/09/2020, 08:00 - Bee: Good morning!
17/09/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: A year ago I took these photos
17/09/2020, 11:17 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! I got up so late today Debby it's actually sad
17/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: How come? Late night? Tired from your exercise? Simply?
17/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Your phone camera is good ya
17/09/2020, 11:24 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/09/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: It's good for long distance daylight photos. Terrible for night or people photos
17/09/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: I think 3 job applications drained me mentally 😂
17/09/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: Aww you got the Google photos thing as well?
17/09/2020, 12:44 - Bee: I do!
17/09/2020, 12:44 - Bee: Did you get your reminder from Photos too?
17/09/2020, 12:46 - Bee: Ahhh. Makes sense. That is an accomplishment
17/09/2020, 12:46 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
17/09/2020, 12:47 - Bee: I have to submit my Casebook tomorrow. It's a book with information and assessment details of all the patients I was assigned during my maternity postings. I might have to be up late tonight
17/09/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Postings begin tomorrow
17/09/2020, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: Waking up late messes up with a lot of my timings. But the only concrete stuff is joining the Bible study later today
17/09/2020, 12:53 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
17/09/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying you get through it
17/09/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: How was college today?
17/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Thank you bb
17/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Ahh. I'm looking forward to the Bible study... Feels like I'm faaar away from home Nischal
17/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Which I am. But I fell like I've moved out. Permanently. I don't know why
17/09/2020, 13:28 - Bee: Feel* 😠
17/09/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: You're living in the moment. That's good. Fully immersed!
17/09/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Oh will you be joining as well? I thought you'd be busy with college stuff
17/09/2020, 14:42 - Bee: Yes I want to. I can spare an hour.
17/09/2020, 14:45 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! See you there
17/09/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been?
17/09/2020, 18:28 - Bee: Busy. Almost done with my casebook
17/09/2020, 18:30 - Bee: Will you be free for a short call? 10 minutes short? Say in about half an hour? Short notice I know. And it's okay if you've got your day planned already. Nothing in particular to talk about... Just to hear your voice
17/09/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yes!!
17/09/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I mean yea sure I should be free
17/09/2020, 18:31 - Bee: 😂😂
17/09/2020, 18:31 - Bee: And here I thought you were good at playing it cool
17/09/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're up for it. I'm pretty chill y'know
17/09/2020, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: Whenever is cool with me
17/09/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: But if you're busy that's fine too. Don't compromise on work that needs to be done
17/09/2020, 18:32 - Bee: I will be compromising if it's a long call. 10 minutes is fine. It's too short but we'll have to make do with it
17/09/2020, 18:33 - Bee: 😂
17/09/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: That's good. 10 min sounds good
17/09/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: I'll keep a stopwatch ready
17/09/2020, 19:02 - Bee: Give me a few more minutes bb
17/09/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: No problem. I'm free when you are
17/09/2020, 19:24 - Bee: Hi
17/09/2020, 19:24 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
17/09/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Nischal
17/09/2020, 19:25 - Nischal Abraham: 1 min
17/09/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Hi!!!!!
17/09/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Okay cool
17/09/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
17/09/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Hi
17/09/2020, 19:26 - Bee: I'll call?
17/09/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
17/09/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Our 10 min call = 23 min
17/09/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Not bad I'd say. Goodnight Bee ☺️
17/09/2020, 19:52 - Bee: We must put the planks tip to test next time
17/09/2020, 19:53 - Bee: And not enough. Goodnight, Nischal. :) 🤗
17/09/2020, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: The what?
18/09/2020, 02:43 - Bee: Planking while talking on the phone
18/09/2020, 02:46 - Bee: Then it will be 10 min = 10 hours and it'll be only you talking because I will have passed out
18/09/2020, 08:07 - Nischal Abraham: Oh planking! I thought it was a typo again
18/09/2020, 08:07 - Nischal Abraham: You have unreal expectations of my physical capabilities
18/09/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: Also good afternoon! How was the first day of postings?
18/09/2020, 11:00 - Bee: Hey :)
18/09/2020, 11:00 - Bee: Yes that happens often I don't blame you
18/09/2020, 11:01 - Bee: 😂
18/09/2020, 11:01 - Bee: It might be possible. You'll never know unless you try
18/09/2020, 11:01 - Bee: *me telling myself this before asking Usha aunty for the ukulele*
18/09/2020, 11:02 - Bee: I wanted the asterisks to be there but it became bold instead
18/09/2020, 11:03 - Bee: Wonderful and tiring
18/09/2020, 11:03 - Bee: Been home for so long with little to none physical exertion. I'll need some time to get used to it
18/09/2020, 11:04 - Bee: My feet hurt. I'm going to take a nap now
18/09/2020, 11:05 - Bee: Will you be free for a call at your 5:30?
18/09/2020, 11:06 - Bee: For an hour or so
18/09/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Planking for 10 hours does not sound possible. Doing anything for 10 straight hours seems too much for me. Maybe sleeping
18/09/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Makes sense. I'm sure you'll get used to it in a day or two
18/09/2020, 11:07 - Bee: Nooooo I meant if you're planking for the duration of a 10 minute phone call then it will feel like a 10 hour phone call
18/09/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me. I should be free
18/09/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: An hour of planking!? 😱
18/09/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: Right. That does make more sense
18/09/2020, 11:12 - Bee: Sure. Rock climbing will be a breeze the next time
18/09/2020, 11:13 - Bee: I'm going to nap now
18/09/2020, 11:13 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/09/2020, 11:14 - Bee: I want to ask specific questions so that you give me specific answers but I don't know what you're up to. We will change that tonight
18/09/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Bye nana
18/09/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your nap!
18/09/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ask specific questions on call!!
18/09/2020, 14:25 - Bee: It was one terrific nap
18/09/2020, 14:25 - Bee: I will!n
18/09/2020, 14:25 - Bee: Will!!* 😠
18/09/2020, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: That's lovely. It must've been a long while since you've physically exerted yourself then 😂
18/09/2020, 15:53 - Bee: Asking you questions is physical exertion?!
18/09/2020, 15:53 - Bee: What's up?
18/09/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Oh you're talking about the nap. Got it.
18/09/2020, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yea the nap 😂
18/09/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Took the guitar out of the case again today. And watched a bunch of YouTube videos
18/09/2020, 16:59 - Bee: You have a guitar there?!?!?!
18/09/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't I tell you Daniel left me his?
18/09/2020, 17:04 - Bee: No!!!!
18/09/2020, 17:04 - Bee: That's so sweet ya.
18/09/2020, 17:04 - Bee: How are the settling in?
18/09/2020, 17:04 - Bee: Tell me when we talk!
18/09/2020, 17:04 - Bee: You have a guitar!!!!!
18/09/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: I do have one. They're settling in fine I guess. I haven't spoken to them since they've gone but he messages on the group and it sounds like they're good
18/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: That's good. Been praying for them.
18/09/2020, 17:09 - Bee: I haven't had dinner yet... I won't be free in 20... Is that okay? I'll let you know when I'm free?
18/09/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Just let me know whenever you're free. I'll be available
18/09/2020, 17:11 - Bee: Okay
18/09/2020, 17:55 - Bee: Bb
18/09/2020, 17:55 - Bee: In 7?
18/09/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: 7 is oddly specific
18/09/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm here for it
18/09/2020, 17:56 - Bee: 5 is too little 10 is too much
18/09/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Whenever you're ready
18/09/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Hi
18/09/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
18/09/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I'll call?
18/09/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
19/09/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy. Good afternoon! 😊. Video for Priya

19/09/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: How was day 2? Did you take a long nap again?
19/09/2020, 16:51 - Bee: Day 2 wasn't as tiring as day 1
19/09/2020, 16:51 - Bee: I did take a nap. Not as long as yesterday though
19/09/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Will you be free for a call tonight?

19/09/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/Bil2hZiHl9Y
20/09/2020, 03:31 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal. :)
20/09/2020, 03:31 - Bee: I hope you have a splendid time of worship today.
20/09/2020, 03:32 - Bee: I will be worshipping here as I  watch babies enter the world.
20/09/2020, 08:33 - Nischal Abraham: I hope to spend good time in worship :)
20/09/2020, 08:33 - Nischal Abraham: Worship with new borns sounds like a treat in itself
20/09/2020, 10:28 - Bee: 😌
20/09/2020, 10:29 - Bee: It was
20/09/2020, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a restful evening. Worship was lovely this morning 😊
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Hi Nischal
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Work was okay
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Looked at a couple houses. There's always something wronf
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Wrong*
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Nothing worked out
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I'm frustrated
20/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I want to curl up and cry
20/09/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Hey I'm sure things will work out in time. You still have some time before you move right?
20/09/2020, 18:27 - Bee: Yes I have some time
20/09/2020, 18:27 - Bee: I'm praying something works out
20/09/2020, 18:27 - Bee: Please pray Nischal
20/09/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying Bee!
20/09/2020, 18:29 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal
20/09/2020, 18:30 - Nischal Abraham: Are you okay?
20/09/2020, 18:30 - Bee: Not really
20/09/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Still feeling this way?
20/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: I am, Nischal
20/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Couldn't hold back my cries during my bath
20/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Spoke to maa papa. Feeling a little better
20/09/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: I'm definitely praying
20/09/2020, 18:38 - Bee: It's a bad day. Hopefully tomorrow is better.
20/09/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Thank you :)

20/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: I'm tired. Going to bed. I hope you've had a good day so far and the rest of it goes well too.
20/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Goodnight, bb. :)
20/09/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: It's been a good day so far. I'll text you more at night
20/09/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! :)
20/09/2020, 21:33 - Nischal Abraham: Went shopping before lunch. Spent some time playing guitar today. Spoke to both Ankush and Megha after a while. It was nice catching up
21/09/2020, 04:53 - Bee: Sounds like you've had a great day 😊
21/09/2020, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you have a good day today!
21/09/2020, 10:58 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/AT-zP1lDJGU
I think this is the video that led me to subscribe to her
21/09/2020, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AibHJB_jlBI
Nope it was this one... Though the previous one is shorter
21/09/2020, 13:01 - Bee: Cool. I'll watch these
21/09/2020, 13:01 - Bee: How are you?
21/09/2020, 13:01 - Bee: What's up?
21/09/2020, 16:38 - Bee: Hi Nischal :). I need to make a decision whether to stick with the current decision of staying in a rented house or moving to my college hostel or traveling from home. I don't know what to do. Please pray for peace and clarity Nischal
Other than that, I had a nice relaxing day in college today. We've made biryani for dinner. It smells amazing. Waiting for everyone to finish off their baths and then we're going to indulge. And there's coke!!! Because biryani is incomplete without Coke. 😋
Looking forward to hearing about you and your day :)
21/09/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely. I have a family meeting in 2 min. I'll message you after its done
21/09/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
21/09/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Will be praying for your decision!!
21/09/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Biryani sounds delicious! 😁. Enjoy yourself
21/09/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Thank you, nana
21/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: It was delicious! I overate. Couldn't get up for a while after
21/09/2020, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. Biryani is sleep inducing food
21/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: ?
21/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: ?
21/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'm alright. The family call was a nice refresher
21/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Just been another uneventful day. Did you have morning postings again?
21/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Going to bed soon?
21/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: What time are you going tomorrow?
21/09/2020, 19:07 - Bee: That's nice 😄 was it a video call?
21/09/2020, 19:07 - Bee: No I had college today. And I have college tomorrow as well
21/09/2020, 19:08 - Bee: There's nothing much to do there. But they can't give all 30 of us postings in the same hospital. Because social distancing. So half in college and half at the hospital
21/09/2020, 19:08 - Bee: In 15ish minutes
21/09/2020, 19:09 - Bee: I have college so I'll leave from here are 8:15
21/09/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: It was! Dad's side of the family with Becky
21/09/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: So more relaxed?
21/09/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds relaxed
21/09/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Ahh. Was Achu there? I haven't spoken to him in so long
21/09/2020, 19:13 - Bee: I will message him now
21/09/2020, 19:13 - Bee: It is relaxed
21/09/2020, 19:13 - Bee: A lot less running around
21/09/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: No... But his older brother Abin was there
21/09/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't spoken to him in a while as well. He had his exams last week. I don't know if he's done with that yet
21/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Exams already?!
21/09/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Didn't he just start his course?
21/09/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. But I'd wished him for his birthday and he told me he's got exams. So well I didn't call
21/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: I'm gonna fall asleep any moment now
21/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Oh
21/09/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
21/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.
21/09/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: .

21/09/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Yep
21/09/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a lovely tomorrow
21/09/2020, 19:18 - Bee: You too 😊
21/09/2020, 19:33 - Bee: I'm not overthinking but I want to ask you. Are we okay?
21/09/2020, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yep we are. I haven't had any reason to think otherwise. Do you?
22/09/2020, 07:39 - Bee: Feels
22/09/2020, 07:39 - Bee: Feels a little off*
22/09/2020, 07:44 - Bee: Might be just me then
22/09/2020, 08:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I was thinking more about it. I must be acting differently if you feel that way. Would you be up for a call today?
22/09/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Brb
22/09/2020, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Where are you going?
22/09/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Nowhere
22/09/2020, 14:14 - Bee: I read your message but didn't have the time to reply
22/09/2020, 14:14 - Bee: But now I do
22/09/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Hi!!
22/09/2020, 14:21 - Bee: Or maybe I'm perceiving it wrongly
22/09/2020, 14:22 - Bee: Today may not be possible Nischal
22/09/2020, 14:22 - Bee: I'll let you know if tomorrow works?
22/09/2020, 14:22 - Bee: Tomorrow should be fine
22/09/2020, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yea tomorrow is fine with me too.  How's your day been?
22/09/2020, 15:28 - Bee: It was a busy day. My practical exams will be held in my college's labs. So there was a lot of prep work to do for it
22/09/2020, 15:28 - Bee: I've got to update my casebook because submission is tomorrow
22/09/2020, 15:28 - Bee: How's your day going?
22/09/2020, 15:32 - Bee: Because casebook
22/09/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Sounds busy... Late night tonight?
22/09/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good so far. Spoke to Achu. He's been really busy
22/09/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay Bee :)
22/09/2020, 16:07 - Bee: I hope not. I want to finish it off and go to sleep as soon as possible
22/09/2020, 16:07 - Bee: Yes I messaged him last night and he said he'll reply properly once he's got more time
22/09/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: His exams were midterms. And they are done now
22/09/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you do!
22/09/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: You don't have to reply if you're busy
22/09/2020, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: This is Us is too intense sometimes 😶
22/09/2020, 16:20 - Bee: Ahh
22/09/2020, 16:20 - Bee: It is!!! It drains you out and then you don't feel like doing anything
22/09/2020, 16:21 - Bee: By you I mean me
22/09/2020, 16:21 - Bee: I will reply as and when I can, nana
22/09/2020, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: You can include me in there😂
22/09/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have a lot more to get done? Did you have dinner? What's for dinner?
22/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: 😂
22/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Almost done. Too exhausted to finish
22/09/2020, 17:20 - Bee: My dearest teacher hasn't told is about our postings for tomorrow 😶
22/09/2020, 17:20 - Bee: And so I'm going to sleep
22/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: She said she'll tell us tonight. But I'm going to sleep. Will have to wake up at 5 and check in case I get a 7am shift
22/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: How are you, Nischal?
22/09/2020, 17:22 - Bee: I had an early dinner. None of us had the energy to cook so we ordered egg curry and porotta. It was delicious.
22/09/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds delicious 😋
22/09/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well today 😊. Life is moving in a direction that resembles forward and I thank God for that
22/09/2020, 17:25 - Bee: What do you mean???!!!!
22/09/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Wow. That's just terrible that you don't know if you have to go early tomorrow
22/09/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Tell me more!
22/09/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Terrible yes. We've given her a reminder
22/09/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Like with the job stuff. Not directly. So no accepted job posting yet. But I've been able to speak to a person from the assembly who's a DB admin
22/09/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: And Rufus spoke to his parents about me and asked if I wanted to talk shop with them next week
22/09/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Wear does DB stand for?
22/09/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Ooh
22/09/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Database
22/09/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Okay
22/09/2020, 17:28 - Bee: So things are moving 😊
22/09/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Things are moving. But then things are always moving by God's hand. These are just the parts I get to see myself
22/09/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Yeah. Things are always moving
22/09/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Are you going to bed now?
22/09/2020, 17:29 - Bee: He's already prepared a way
22/09/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Yes all ready for bed
22/09/2020, 17:29 - Bee: I'll read some and then sleep
22/09/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Early sleep time 😮. I'm very impressed
22/09/2020, 17:30 - Bee: I'm continuing The horse and his boy. Left off halfway in June
22/09/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Ikr?! I'm impressed too
22/09/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: CS Lewis!?
22/09/2020, 17:30 - Bee: Yes
22/09/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome!!!!
22/09/2020, 17:31 - Bee: 🤩
22/09/2020, 17:31 - Bee: What are you doing?
22/09/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Going to exercise now. Then take a shower, have a ham and cheese sandwich for dinner
22/09/2020, 17:31 - Bee: Okay
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Watch an episode of This is Us. Night routine and sleep
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Bee: What are your plans for tomorrow?
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Talk to you if you're free
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Bee: What happened to it being draining and all
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: And the rest will get planned in the morning
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Okay
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: I get to sleep more if I'm drained yes?
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😑
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Bee: Yes
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂*
22/09/2020, 17:32 - Bee: But you sleep on time anyway
22/09/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: It's getting colder so it's getting more and more difficult to wake up on time
22/09/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Na it probably will still be draining. But I want to know what happens next. S2 episode one gave me a restless night and I NEED to know how Jack dies!!
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: I don't think they reveal it until much later
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Who knows
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Maybe I don't remember well
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: No spoilers!!!!!!!!
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'll know. When I watch it
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: I was disappointed tho.
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. That's why I don't discuss it much
22/09/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Okay. Let me know when your reach that part
22/09/2020, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: The chronicles of Narnia ends on a good note so you won't be disappointed
22/09/2020, 17:36 - Bee: I kinda know how it ends because of all the blogs and pins I've read
22/09/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: It's a Bible story ending 😂
22/09/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well anyway. Goodnight Bee! Talk to you soon
22/09/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'll go do my exercising. You go do your reading and sleeping
22/09/2020, 17:46 - Bee: No spoilers Nischal!!!!
22/09/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Bye, bb. <3
22/09/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I miss you. Bye.
22/09/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you more
22/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Nope. Not possible.
22/09/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: It is. I'm telling you what I know
22/09/2020, 18:02 - Bee: If I'm sure about anything other than God's love and your love for me, it is this
22/09/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: If you're sure of my love for you you'll know this is true
22/09/2020, 18:13 - Bee: I'm also sure about my love for you. If only you knew the depth and height.
22/09/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: The width and fullness of it. I look forward to feeling it fully when we get to
23/09/2020, 06:18 - Bee: I look forward to it too. :)
23/09/2020, 10:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee! Hope your day's been wonderful. What time did you have to go finally?
23/09/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Hey! :)
23/09/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Evening shift today. I got to sleep in 😌
23/09/2020, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely. What time would you have to go in?
23/09/2020, 14:55 - Bee: 1. Ended at 6
23/09/2020, 14:55 - Bee: Raining heavily today! Many of my classmates didn't come in. Trains aren't running
23/09/2020, 14:55 - Bee: What's up?
23/09/2020, 14:55 - Bee: I'm exhausted. And hungry
23/09/2020, 14:58 - Nischal Abraham: Eat. Sleep.
23/09/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Ate and I'm sleepy too 😅
23/09/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Oh
23/09/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: I thought when you said evening you meant you start in the evening and it goes on into the night
23/09/2020, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: When's your shift tomorrow?
23/09/2020, 15:13 - Bee: What did you eat?
23/09/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Nope. That was what I thought too. Before nursing. But evening shifts are more afternoon shifts
23/09/2020, 15:14 - Bee: I don't know yet... My dearest teacher will take her sweet sweet time to tell us
23/09/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Leftover pasta
23/09/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Interesting. Isn't this the shift you least prefer?
23/09/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: :(
23/09/2020, 16:15 - Bee: Instant pasta or your butter garlic soy sauce pasta?
23/09/2020, 16:15 - Bee: I don't mind it actually
23/09/2020, 16:15 - Bee: But morning shifts are better. I'm done early and have a huge chuck if the day to do what I want
23/09/2020, 16:16 - Bee: 😑
23/09/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: The latter
23/09/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: What?
23/09/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sad for you
23/09/2020, 17:52 - Bee: I meant chunk and I'm sure you understood
23/09/2020, 17:52 - Bee: But just in case you didn't
23/09/2020, 17:52 - Bee: My response to my teacher
23/09/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Why nana
23/09/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Nischal, yesterday I told you that today would be fine for a call but I'm exhausted Nischal
23/09/2020, 18:13 - Bee: And I have a mock practical exam on Friday for which I'll be studying tomorrow evening and night
23/09/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay. Yesterday you didn't know you had an afternoon shift
23/09/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Yeah
23/09/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Will be praying for your exam :)
23/09/2020, 18:13 - Bee: My dearest teacher told us this today
23/09/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice she gave you a heads up
23/09/2020, 18:14 - Bee: My finals will be on 29th and 30th. This mock one is because we're having practical exams in college instead of the hospital. Following the OSCE method that I had told you about
23/09/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Ikr. So kind of her.
23/09/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: So no actual patients then?
23/09/2020, 18:31 - Bee: No actual patients. Only scenarios
23/09/2020, 18:32 - Bee: What are you doing?
23/09/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Any update on the job front?
23/09/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Did you play the guitar today?
23/09/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Any catch up calls?
23/09/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Grocery runs?
23/09/2020, 18:33 - Bee: Exercise?
23/09/2020, 18:34 - Nischal Abraham: Too many questions
23/09/2020, 18:34 - Bee: Be prepared for more
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: It's been a quiet day today. It's a no for all of them
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Your favourite colour? Is it still that shade of green?
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Current song on repeat?
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Bee: No for this?
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: No for this too
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Quiet how?
23/09/2020, 18:35 - Bee: Okay
23/09/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Oh did I not tell you it's blue now
23/09/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: There's no song playing
23/09/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Noooooooooooo you didn't
23/09/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: House is empty
23/09/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Cause it would be a lie if I did
23/09/2020, 18:36 - Bee: What's the RGB code
23/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: 😂
23/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: So it's green
23/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Some shade of olive green
23/09/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Playing chess
23/09/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Random online players?
23/09/2020, 18:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
23/09/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Oh. I thought the 'I don't feel like doing anything today' kinda quiet
23/09/2020, 18:38 - Bee: You can play music and cook! Or are they going to be back before dinner time?
23/09/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Would you like to get on a phone call? Are you okay?
23/09/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm okay. Just don't feel like messaging a lot
23/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Okay
23/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: That's okay :)
23/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: It's time for me to sleep anyway
23/09/2020, 18:41 - Bee: I'll read some and then sleep
23/09/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: What're you reading?
23/09/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: That too
23/09/2020, 18:42 - Bee: The horse and his boy. Haven't finished
23/09/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Idk when they'll be back. Don't really want to cook anything tonight
23/09/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Ah enjoy. I found it to be quite slow compared to other books in the series
23/09/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Nana, it's okay if you don't message/reply
23/09/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Yes, slow. That's why I stopped halfway for 3 months
23/09/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. You rest well. Hope you have an amazing day tomorrow Bee
23/09/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
23/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: I hope you have an amazing rest of today and tomorrow as well.
23/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: ❤️
23/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Goodnight, bb. :)
24/09/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Hope your day's been well. What shift did you end up in?
24/09/2020, 10:43 - Bee: Hey :)
24/09/2020, 10:43 - Bee: Evening shift. Busy day. So many patients.
24/09/2020, 10:44 - Bee: I hope you have a good day. :)
24/09/2020, 10:44 - Bee: What have you planned for today?
24/09/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done for the day already?
24/09/2020, 10:46 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks you ☺️
24/09/2020, 10:47 - Nischal Abraham: Just the Bible study with Bethesda. Everything else is improvised
24/09/2020, 10:50 - Bee: No. I'll be here until 6
24/09/2020, 10:50 - Bee: I won't be attending the Bible study today... I have to study
24/09/2020, 10:51 - Bee: Also, you should stay back for a while! People usually chat after they've crossed the few awkward minutes
24/09/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: Right. I'll leave you to it. I'm surprised you manage to reply during a shift
24/09/2020, 10:52 - Bee: I got to sit down for a few
24/09/2020, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: Praying your studies go well 😊. I'll miss you. Not that there is much talkijg during the study anyway
24/09/2020, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hmmm... I'll try and wait back today then
24/09/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Hopefully we'll talk tomorrow. :)
24/09/2020, 10:55 - Bee: I would swipe (because I'm using zoom on the phone) and look at your name. Shya it sounds creepy now.
24/09/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: We'll talk when we can. Don't worry about it. Focus on what you need to do 😁
24/09/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: What's in a name. It doesn't sound creepy to me
24/09/2020, 11:09 - Bee: Because you're behind it. At least on zoom
24/09/2020, 11:09 - Bee: Tomorrow!!!!!!!
24/09/2020, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: If tomorrow works out I'd be delighted ☺️
24/09/2020, 15:16 - Bee: Just got home. I'm tired 😫 this has become everyday's story now.
24/09/2020, 15:16 - Bee: I apologize for all the days to come when I'll whine about my tiredness
24/09/2020, 15:16 - Bee: What's up?
24/09/2020, 15:16 - Bee: Oh Bible study!!!!
24/09/2020, 15:16 - Bee: Sorry bye.
24/09/2020, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I'm sure it's a tiring day of hard work. Bible study just ended. There weren't many people today
24/09/2020, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hope studying is going well! Don't reply if you're studying
24/09/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Studying is going okay...
24/09/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Did people interact after? It's one of the things I look forward to every meeting
24/09/2020, 18:45 - Bee: I am '🍇ful' (singular) for you.
24/09/2020, 20:36 - Nischal Abraham: Why are you singular for me?
25/09/2020, 01:48 - Bee: No reason
25/09/2020, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Hii! Hope you enjoy your shift today. I don't know what time you're in or out but enjoy it anyway 😊
25/09/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/NkwU5OWKEeQ
25/09/2020, 12:51 - Bee: Hey!
25/09/2020, 12:51 - Bee: I had my mock practical exam today. So I was in college
25/09/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Just got back. Making Maggi. Maggi after a long day tastes amazing
25/09/2020, 13:21 - Bee: Free for a call tonight?
25/09/2020, 13:37 - Bee: I don't think I understood the story in the music video but the character designs are so cute. And the sweet voices
25/09/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! How did it go?
25/09/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I'm sure it does 😊
25/09/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: I am. What time will you be free?
25/09/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: I like the voice too! It's very soothing. I used to listen to them back in 11th and 12th
25/09/2020, 15:13 - Bee: So-so. Could've gone better. Final on Monday. Hopefully it goes better
25/09/2020, 15:13 - Bee: It's 10:15ish okay?
25/09/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Or 10
25/09/2020, 15:13 - Bee: ?
25/09/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yep sounds good to me 😊
25/09/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Ready when you are
25/09/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Give me 10?
25/09/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Cool
25/09/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Hi

25/09/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Hii
25/09/2020, 18:04 - Bee: I'll call?
25/09/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/09/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Here's my assessment. You had a family zoom call. So now your internet has run out
25/09/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Since you're using mobile data
25/09/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Which is terribly unfortunate cause if I knew I'd have said goodbye lot sooner 🙁
25/09/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I pray you enjoy your night and your day in college tomorrow. Praying for you always 😊
25/09/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Hi
25/09/2020, 19:28 - Bee: What would you have done?
25/09/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Your assessment is correct
25/09/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: On hotspot?
25/09/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Nope
25/09/2020, 19:29 - Bee: It isn't 12 yet but I have internet now
25/09/2020, 19:29 - Bee: Tomorrow's 3gb
25/09/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. I guess it comes in earlier than 12 then
25/09/2020, 19:30 - Bee: Yeah
25/09/2020, 19:30 - Bee: I'll call?
25/09/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
26/09/2020, 10:08 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee! How was/is college going? What's your plans for the rest of the day?
26/09/2020, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have an awesome day ahead of you 😊. It was 3° this morning so it ended up being an effort getting out of my duvet
26/09/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Hi Nischal :))
26/09/2020, 10:11 - Bee: College is uneventful. Kinda emotional

26/09/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Here*
26/09/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Haven't told my parents yet
26/09/2020, 10:11 - Bee: I will surprise them
26/09/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! I hope it ends up being a good kind of surprise
26/09/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Get some studying done as well! And enjoy home food 😋
26/09/2020, 11:50 - Bee: 3°?!
26/09/2020, 11:50 - Bee: I hope so too. What if nobody is home? They'll give me a surprise instead
26/09/2020, 11:52 - Bee: I hope to be back by tomorrow evening. I don't think I'll be able to get any studying done until then
26/09/2020, 11:52 - Bee: I think I'm gonna have to wear my glasses full time
26/09/2020, 11:56 - Bee: What are your plans for today m
26/09/2020, 11:56 - Bee: ?*

26/09/2020, 13:16 - Bee: I AM HOME! ♥️
26/09/2020, 13:16 - Bee: No but it's getting harder for me to read far away stuff
26/09/2020, 13:16 - Bee: I'm hesitant to get my eyes checked. The number must have increased
26/09/2020, 13:17 - Bee: What are you going to read?
26/09/2020, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: Welcome home!! (Is what I would say if I was there)
26/09/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Well the good news is that I think you'll look lovely regardless
26/09/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: A lot of blogs and articles
26/09/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Trying to learn a new programming language

26/09/2020, 14:11 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/09/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Thanks nana. :))
26/09/2020, 14:13 - Bee: Oh. What's it called?
26/09/2020, 14:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/09/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. Yea you just learn to breathe slower. It's all training really. But I can see how that's a bigger problem when you're at the hospital
26/09/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: React
26/09/2020, 14:14 - Bee: It's from the joy of being home
26/09/2020, 14:14 - Bee: I'll still take it
26/09/2020, 14:15 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. So good surprise then?
26/09/2020, 14:15 - Bee: I'll have to get used to it now. I don't want my number to increase
26/09/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Ehhhhh brothers weren't too excited. But father and mother were!
26/09/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Grandmother too. She was happy to see me
26/09/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Haha that's what I'd expect. Have a fun weekend home Bee 😁
26/09/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: You could wear it as often as you aren't wearing a mask if you can make do without it when travelling
26/09/2020, 14:19 - Bee: I'm going to have to wear a mask all the time
26/09/2020, 14:20 - Bee: Not at home tho. But I'm wearing it now for practice
26/09/2020, 14:20 - Bee: Maa has invited Keziya and her husband home for dinner
26/09/2020, 14:20 - Bee: So there's special food
26/09/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh sounds lovely! It's almost as if they knew you were gonna be home
26/09/2020, 15:58 - Bee: Ikr. They had to leave early so we had an early dinner. They brought sweets. The too-sweet-for-Nischal kinda Indian sweets
26/09/2020, 15:58 - Bee: Yum.
26/09/2020, 16:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ah the perfectly-sweet-for-Debby kind
26/09/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Right
26/09/2020, 17:01 - Bee: What's up?
26/09/2020, 17:08 - Bee: I'm tired (nothing new). And I'm going to sleep early
26/09/2020, 17:11 - Bee: I don't know what's wrong Nischal. I'm so tired every night. I don't think I have as much physical exertion tho.
26/09/2020, 17:11 - Bee: I'll analyse that tomorrow. Tonight I sleep early.
26/09/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep early and rest well. Tomorrow enjoy worship and be renewed in spirit and body. I think it's a blessing to feel tired at the end of the day Bee
26/09/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm waiting for the days when I'll be the same too 😊
26/09/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Marshmallow hey
26/09/2020, 17:17 - Bee: I was in the middle of typing a long message but halfway I forgot what I wanted to say.
26/09/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Watching my third episode of This is Us. But these three seems to be a triplet so I had to watch all of them. Number One, Number Two and Number Three
26/09/2020, 17:17 - Bee: A random appreciation message. But I've forgotten so this must do
26/09/2020, 17:17 - Bee: For now
26/09/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: I appreciate the appreciation ☺️
26/09/2020, 17:18 - Bee: You're an amazing person. I'm going to have to learn new words because the ones I know don't do any justice. New ones won't either via I'll try
26/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: But*************!
26/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Soon.
26/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: All in God's time.
26/09/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Goodnight :)
26/09/2020, 17:20 - Bee: I know it's 5ish for you which is too early for goodnight
26/09/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'll take a goodnight any time of the day
26/09/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Save it up for the night
26/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: But until we're in the same timezone, odd wishes will have to do
26/09/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: The best things are said in the fewest simplest words. You've been around kids enough to know that Bee 😁
26/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Yeah. Too many words aren't needed. We have our silence
26/09/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Oh!!! There's this post I wanted to send. I'll do it tomorrow
26/09/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Bye!
26/09/2020, 17:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/09/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: I love you too :). Byee
27/09/2020, 03:44 - Bee: It is 1° where you are rn!
27/09/2020, 07:33 - Bee: It is 0° now!! 😫
27/09/2020, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: Nights tend to drop. But I'm comfy in my duvet so don't notice it. The good news is it only goes up for the rest of the morning 😊
27/09/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Still cold!
27/09/2020, 13:58 - Bee: I'm on my way back to Kharghar
27/09/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Have  a safe trip back! Travelling by bus?
27/09/2020, 14:26 - Bee: Yes. Got it surprisingly quick. Didn't have to wait at all
27/09/2020, 14:28 - Bee: Attending the memorial service on the way
27/09/2020, 14:32 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Me too. Not on the way anywhere though
27/09/2020, 14:49 - Bee: This uncle is not holding back
27/09/2020, 14:49 - Bee: 😂
27/09/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: I had to dip out for the testimonies. Went to have lunch
27/09/2020, 15:38 - Bee: I probably should too. Need to revise for tomorrow's exam. But I want to stay for the whole thing and listen to the testimonies
27/09/2020, 15:38 - Bee: I reached around half an hour ago
27/09/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: That's good to know 😊. I'm praying for your studies. I think if it's streaming on YouTube you should be able to watch it even afterwards
27/09/2020, 15:40 - Bee: I don't think it will be uploaded
27/09/2020, 15:40 - Bee: The funeral service wasn't uploaded
27/09/2020, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Then I guess it won't be uploaded
27/09/2020, 16:35 - Bee: I stayed until the end. I'm glad I did. :)
27/09/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Now time to hustle
27/09/2020, 17:03 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy!
27/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Off to bed
27/09/2020, 19:11 - Bee: My second to last practical exam for this course
27/09/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about your day
27/09/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Bye, my beloved. :)
27/09/2020, 20:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure you will crush it! Looking forward to hearing how it goes 😊
27/09/2020, 20:27 - Nischal Abraham: My day today was Worship, shopping, biryani for lunch, attended the memorial service, chess, coding stream, exercise shower, YT, reading and sleeping
28/09/2020, 10:00 - Nischal Abraham: Still praying for your exam. I forgot to ask when you'll be done 😅
28/09/2020, 13:23 - Bee: Hey!
28/09/2020, 13:24 - Bee: My exam went better than expected
28/09/2020, 13:24 - Bee: No more obstetrics!!!! Unless God has different plans
28/09/2020, 13:25 - Bee: I've got a terrible cold and headache. I've taken a paracetamol and now I'll go to sleep
28/09/2020, 13:25 - Bee: What's up?
28/09/2020, 13:25 - Bee: How are you?
28/09/2020, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Rest plenty. And you have to go tomorrow too 😶
28/09/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: Don't have a cold. I've been making okay progress with my programming. Gonna go make some lunch now
28/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: Yes that's why the medicine. Otherwise I wouldn't have taken anything
28/09/2020, 13:27 - Bee: What about your blog and article reading
28/09/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'm well 😊. Had a lovely restful sleep last night
28/09/2020, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: The weather is less cold today
28/09/2020, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's always happening on the side. It goes hand in hand with YouTube watching
28/09/2020, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have a lot of studying to do for tomorrow? I hope you get better soon 🙁
28/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Hey
28/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I slept and had dinner and spoke to parents
28/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I have a lot to study. Won't be studying all of it. Only what I think is important. Which may not even be asked tho
28/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I hope I get better soon too
28/09/2020, 18:00 - Bee: I'm much better after my nap
28/09/2020, 18:01 - Bee: Been drinking warm water and took steam once
28/09/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: That's good you're feeling better ☺️. I'm praying you'll find the strength to study and be fine for your exam
28/09/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: What time is it tomorrow?
28/09/2020, 18:48 - Bee: I have to reach college by 7:30. Exam starts at 8
28/09/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Sleeping late?
28/09/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Nope. Sleeping now
28/09/2020, 18:54 - Bee: I'm tired. Even after my nap. Makes no sense
28/09/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: You're sick. It makes perfect sense
28/09/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Oh, I might be going home in two days!
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Like forever
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: I'm worried for you Bee
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Not forever but you get it right
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: It's just a cold nana
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: I'll be fine
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: Tijy found a mess?
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Yes!
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
28/09/2020, 18:55 - Bee: .
28/09/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Nawwwwwwwwww

28/09/2020, 18:56 - Bee: It's from that movie right?
28/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. I'll add it to the list
28/09/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
28/09/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Cool
28/09/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Looking forward to so many things Nischal :)
28/09/2020, 18:57 - Bee: My heart is full
28/09/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: First an exam
28/09/2020, 18:57 - Bee: How kind of you. Always bringing me back to reality and keeping me grounded. Thanks.
28/09/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Goodnight, bb!

29/09/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!! How are you feeling today?
29/09/2020, 13:34 - Bee: Hey :)
29/09/2020, 13:34 - Bee: Feeling the same. But there's no exam tomorrow that I have to worry about so it's fine
29/09/2020, 13:36 - Bee: Today's exam was alright. I was the first to go for the Vivas so made quite a few blunders.
29/09/2020, 13:36 - Bee: But my exams are over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
29/09/2020, 13:36 - Bee: 😌
29/09/2020, 13:38 - Bee: I've got my dissertation to worry about now.
29/09/2020, 13:38 - Bee: Enough about me. How's your day going?
29/09/2020, 13:38 - Bee: How are you?
29/09/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: Just got back home from a long walk with Sandeep. He found a place in Kilcock so I went to meet him
29/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: It was lovely weather today. Absolutely enjoyed having been out of shape and walking. I have a feeling I'll feel tired tonight
29/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: When is that due?
29/09/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: Same is better than worse! 😁
29/09/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure you did well. I always liked being first for something then I'm over and done with it and don't have to worry in anticipation
29/09/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy!!!!!!!!
29/09/2020, 16:59 - Bee: Oh! How's he doing? Is he going to visit like he wanted to?
29/09/2020, 16:59 - Bee: We've been given a month
29/09/2020, 16:59 - Bee: You'll fall into a sweet sleep tonight
29/09/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I don't like being first because I don't know what to expect
29/09/2020, 17:01 - Bee: IKR 🤩
29/09/2020, 17:01 - Bee: We finished dinner early today. Going to sleep now. My head feels heavy
29/09/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I hope you get better soon... What's your plans for tomorrow?
29/09/2020, 17:21 - Bee: I have a morning shift. After which I might go home!
29/09/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Are you happy you get to be back home?
30/09/2020, 03:22 - Bee: I'm not looking forward to the traveling but I am happy I get to go back
30/09/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Hope you're feeling better today
30/09/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's what I thought as well
30/09/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: How was postings? Are you home yet?
30/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Hey :)
30/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Just got back.
30/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: I drove!!!!! From Kharghar to here.
30/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Much much much much better. The cold is almost gone
30/09/2020, 15:29 - Bee: :)
30/09/2020, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: Was it the driving that makes you feel better 😂. Either way I'm happy to hear it!!
30/09/2020, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Dad came to pick you up then? Was the goodbye hard? But I guess you might meet them during postings or something right
30/09/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Yes. Maa and my uncle came too
30/09/2020, 15:44 - Bee: 😂 might be true
30/09/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Saying goodbye to Tijy was a little hard. Staying with her reminded my of my precious hostel days
30/09/2020, 15:45 - Bee: But I will see them during postings
30/09/2020, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. I hope you're resting today too. Just because you're feeling better doesn't mean you shouldn't rest
30/09/2020, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Postings tomorrow?
30/09/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Yes. I don't know which shift yet
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Yes will be heading to bed early
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Bee: What's up?
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Bee: How are you?
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Bee: How's the coding going?
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: But what if you have a morning shift? And you still don't know 😮
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Bee: What was for lunch?
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: How will you travel!? What time would you have to leave?
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: Resting
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Yes I still don't know. My dearest teacher teaches me patience
30/09/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'm good. Miss talking to you
30/09/2020, 15:50 - Bee: If 7am shift then I'll have to leave at least by 5
30/09/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: It's slow progress. But there is progress. I found a really cool new game but I don't want to start it otherwise I'll just be wasting more time 🙁
30/09/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: Ham and cheese sandwich. I needed to use up my ham slices before they go bad
30/09/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: Positive outlook. I like it
30/09/2020, 15:51 - Bee: Awww. We will talk as soon as I settle in. Or if I don't have a morning shift!!!!
30/09/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: I pray you don't get it then 😂
30/09/2020, 15:51 - Bee: There's an update on how long my course will be. I will tell you whenever we talk next
30/09/2020, 15:51 - Bee: No veggies?
30/09/2020, 15:51 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Making a note of it
30/09/2020, 15:52 - Bee: Yep. 0.000009% of it is positive
30/09/2020, 15:52 - Bee: But that also means I'll be done early!
30/09/2020, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: We'll talk in time when there is time. It's okay that I don't know, I just miss it is all
30/09/2020, 15:53 - Bee: Afternoon shifts will be more comfy for maa. She will want to wake up and pack Tiffins even if there's no need to
30/09/2020, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: No... I'll add in carrots and potatoes for dinner
30/09/2020, 15:53 - Bee: I miss hearing your voice too.
30/09/2020, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm.... Hmmmmmmmmm
30/09/2020, 15:53 - Bee: This consoling is more for me
30/09/2020, 15:54 - Bee: Ahhh. That's how it works eh
30/09/2020, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: I pray you find the strength to go through whichever shift it may be then
30/09/2020, 16:09 - Bee: Thank you, nana. :)
30/09/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: So did you have dinner yet?
30/09/2020, 16:19 - Bee: Going to have now. There's special fish fry. Because I'm back home.
30/09/2020, 16:19 - Bee: Imagine the kind of meal you're gonna have once you come here
30/09/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know. Probably just home food. Which is the best food if you ask me 😊
30/09/2020, 16:38 - Bee: A homemade feast for sure
30/09/2020, 16:39 - Bee: Will you be free for a short call tonight?
30/09/2020, 16:39 - Bee: I have a might shift tomorrow
30/09/2020, 16:39 - Bee: Night*
30/09/2020, 16:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yes!! I'd love to be in a call 😊
30/09/2020, 16:40 - Bee: Brb
30/09/2020, 17:18 - Bee: In an hour? Is that okay?
30/09/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Sounds good to me
30/09/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee... Are we still up for a call?
30/09/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: I should've guessed you'd be tired today. It's good you're resting Bee ☺️. Goodnight!
30/09/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: And good morning for when you read this!
30/09/2020, 21:04 - Bee: NISCHAL
30/09/2020, 21:04 - Bee: I fell asleep
30/09/2020, 21:06 - Bee: Please forgive me 😞
30/09/2020, 21:07 - Bee: I'm sorry Nischal.
30/09/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Please?
30/09/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Bye.
30/09/2020, 21:45 - Nischal Abraham: What? 😂. Don't apologize for it! It's okay
30/09/2020, 21:45 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know why you got up and messaged. You should be sleeping all the way to morning 😠
30/09/2020, 21:46 - Nischal Abraham: Byee Bee! I hope you have a lovely day tomorrow!!
01/10/2020, 06:44 - Bee: I should've told you. But I didn't plan on falling asleep. It just happened
01/10/2020, 06:44 - Bee: Did I keep you waiting?
01/10/2020, 06:45 - Bee: I woke up in panic 😂 and hoped that when I look at the time on my phone or would still be early enough to call. But alas

01/10/2020, 07:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hacktoberfest starts today. Unfortunately the online event is based on Indian time 🙁
01/10/2020, 07:15 - Nischal Abraham: So I've been up for a while
01/10/2020, 10:58 - Bee: Oh :(
01/10/2020, 10:58 - Bee: Will Hacktoberfest go on for the whole month?
01/10/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it's for the whole month. The event was just an opening thing. Everything else is time independent
01/10/2020, 12:53 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/10/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Oh. I have a few questions about it. I will ask you on Saturday night
01/10/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Or _saternight_ ?
01/10/2020, 12:54 - Bee: No wait
01/10/2020, 12:54 - Bee: _Saturnight_
01/10/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like an accurate term
01/10/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo!!! Was it crowded? Did you travel alright?
01/10/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it ☺️. Why Saturday night though?
01/10/2020, 13:50 - Bee: I have a night shift tomorrow as well. But tomorrow is October 2nd (Gandhi Jayanthi, in case you don't remember). So since I'm working on the 2nd I'll get Saturday off. And that's why Saturday night. If that's okay with you
01/10/2020, 13:50 - Bee: Not crowded at all
01/10/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yay holiday!

01/10/2020, 20:03 - Bee: I miss you ya. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Don't know when that'll be. I've imagined around 3 different versions already 😂
01/10/2020, 20:03 - Bee: Messages weren't getting delivered and I thought you might've switched off your internet for the day. But they just got delivered!!!!!!
01/10/2020, 20:07 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!
01/10/2020, 20:10 - Bee: My insides feel all warm and fuzzy. Like I've had the tastiest dessert ever. The kind that fills the whole house with this amazing aroma while it's being cooked. But I haven't eaten any desserts. This happens every time I think of you. 
I'm praying for you and your tomorrows too.
01/10/2020, 20:53 - Nischal Abraham: Only 3? I was almost certain you'd have more 😂

01/10/2020, 21:20 - Nischal Abraham: Coding. Day feels so long since I got up at 6. I'll probably go to sleep early tonight. I didn't join the Bible study. Ended up having a late lunch and lost track of time. Dinner was a banana

04/10/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Sounds fancy ya. Well done!

04/10/2020, 13:58 - Bee: To keep me warm you need some fat and tissue under your skin no

04/10/2020, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Is it being played on Zoom? I don't want to disturb a call midway through a movie
04/10/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Zoom yes
04/10/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Now I'm joining a movie halfway through
04/10/2020, 14:00 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yes yes. Or I could use external blankets

04/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I'd rather have you do it man
04/10/2020, 14:16 - Bee: You have to teach me how to sing like that

04/10/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Nischal
For the month of October, I've been asked to take lectures for second year students... It will be counted as a part of my internship posting. Will be posted in the hospital in the month of November. 
I'm nervous. It involves a lot of prep obv. And I'll be the only student in my class who's going to be in college
04/10/2020, 15:51 - Bee: It also means I'll have fixed hours and will be home for the night. Which I'm happy about. And I'll be free on the evening of the 30th for the sisters meeting :) prayer answered
04/10/2020, 15:51 - Bee: I'm nervous. And don't want to put in half hearted efforts.
04/10/2020, 15:51 - Bee: Please pray for me.
04/10/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: Thanking God for answered prayer 😊
04/10/2020, 15:57 - Nischal Abraham: But won't that mean 13th is blocked off
04/10/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Dive in wholeheartedly. Sounds like an interesting opportunity to be teaching
04/10/2020, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: But when you say in college does that mean students will be coming into campus?
04/10/2020, 16:07 - Bee: Indeed
04/10/2020, 16:07 - Bee: Not yet. I'll be posted in the hospital during November. The rotation hasn't come out yet. I've requested for night shifts... But we'll see
04/10/2020, 16:08 - Bee: It is. I'll be teaching a subject which I haven't studied in a while. I'm looking forward to it
04/10/2020, 16:08 - Bee: Yep. Students will be coming in next week onwards. In batches tho. Around 10 students every day
04/10/2020, 16:17 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. 10 students sounds small. I misread earlier. So you'll be teaching this month and in the hospital next month
04/10/2020, 16:18 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you'd be teaching next month 😂
04/10/2020, 16:18 - Nischal Abraham: Which subject is that?
04/10/2020, 16:26 - Bee: Nope. This month
04/10/2020, 16:26 - Bee: Yep
04/10/2020, 16:27 - Bee: Medical-Surgical Nursing 1
It includes the heart, lungs, kidneys, bones, and their diseases
04/10/2020, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh interesting. Starting tomorrow?
04/10/2020, 16:33 - Bee: Yes. But this week is only prep. Students will be coming from the 12th
04/10/2020, 16:34 - Bee: I'm not feeling good Nischal. Nothing to do with tomorrow. Just generally. I want to run away and be alone for a while. Thinking about too many unnecessary things
04/10/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Please pray for me
04/10/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'll definitely pray. Do you want to talk?
04/10/2020, 17:08 - Bee: I don't feel like talking Nischal... I'm sorry :(
04/10/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay :). I'm here if you want to
04/10/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm always praying. Any other plans for tonight?
04/10/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Nope. Walk with Reenee got cancelled. She's got work to do
04/10/2020, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: What about Jason?
04/10/2020, 17:33 - Bee: He didn't feel like going for one
04/10/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'd join you for a walk but it still be raining heavy
04/10/2020, 17:49 - Bee: It's not raining here tho.
04/10/2020, 17:49 - Bee: What's up?
04/10/2020, 17:49 - Bee: How are you?
04/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Spoke to Asha?
04/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Got any reading or coding done?
04/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Rested?
04/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Going out?
04/10/2020, 17:52 - Bee: I should've gone for the walk by myself.
04/10/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: I did none of the things
04/10/2020, 18:01 - Bee: ?
04/10/2020, 18:01 - Bee: ?
04/10/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I miss you. I don't understand how because we've hardly spent any time together
04/10/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Well I miss all the time we haven't spent together
04/10/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Now that you mentioned coding I'm opening my code
04/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Feeling lazy. I'm gonna stop forcing exercise and prioritize walks and eating for a while
04/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: Sounds wise.
04/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: Will you be free for a short call.
04/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: ?*
04/10/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... What time?
04/10/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Or did you mean immediately and I'm too late to reply :(
04/10/2020, 18:43 - Bee: No no no
04/10/2020, 18:43 - Bee: I'm helping Jason out with some stuff

04/10/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: You sure sure? I know you have to go tomorrow. Decide the time limit for the call
04/10/2020, 19:20 - Bee: I'm sure sure.
04/10/2020, 19:20 - Bee: Won't talk for longer than 10 minutes
04/10/2020, 19:23 - Nischal Abraham: Okay I'm ready
04/10/2020, 19:25 - Bee: I'll call?
04/10/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
05/10/2020, 07:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/10/2020, 07:30 - Bee: I hope you have a splendid day! Mine is going well so far :)
05/10/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: Is that you waking me up?
05/10/2020, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear it!! I was up btw but hadn't switched on the net on my phone
05/10/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: It's another rainy moody day today. I really hope it clears up later in the day and I can go for a walk
05/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: Yes. I was expecting to see a cute gif when I typed in 'rise and shine' but this came up instead
05/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: And I like this better
05/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: I'm done for today!!!! It was a good day. :)))) I'm not tired. I want to go for a walk once I'm back home
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: I hope so too... A walk in the rain doesn't sound that bad tho
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Does it?
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Does it, Nischal?
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Does it?
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Does it sound bad?
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Huh?
05/10/2020, 11:58 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/10/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yay!! Day 1 down 😁
05/10/2020, 12:01 - Bee: Why would he hang clothes outside when he knows its going to rain?
05/10/2020, 12:01 - Bee: My forecast app says that it'll definitely rain there tonight. Maybe the weather won't clear up
05/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/10/2020, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: He's holding out for 60% 😂
05/10/2020, 12:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! I won't spoil it for you. Let me know when you're done then I can talk about it 😊
05/10/2020, 13:16 - Bee: I reached home. I was wishing for traffic so that I can listen to more of the podcast because boy, that podcast is the shizz!!!
05/10/2020, 13:16 - Bee: 1.5 done. 1.5 to go
05/10/2020, 13:16 - Bee: I have so many questions. Nope just one question. The same one that Jace has
05/10/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: It is a good one
05/10/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Did you go for a walk then?
05/10/2020, 15:22 - Bee: I did. Went around Dmart to SGNP entrance and then back
05/10/2020, 15:23 - Bee: What about you?
05/10/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: No walk for me. I joined in on a Dev livestream. Also it's gonna start raining so I'm skipping walk today
05/10/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: Planning on cutting my hair
05/10/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/cC8KT07m5aY
05/10/2020, 16:54 - Bee: Photo pls
05/10/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Before or after? Cause before is a mess 😂
05/10/2020, 16:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/10/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Both
05/10/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Obv both
05/10/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Its impossible for me to match that level. You'll have to deal with my sad selfies
05/10/2020, 17:06 - Bee: Yes it's impossible. But you can try
05/10/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Heading to bed early today.
05/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Goodnight, nana. :)
05/10/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/10/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/10/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: The haircut took too long so I didn't trim. But now that I'm looking at the photo the beard looks decent 😶
06/10/2020, 07:28 - Bee: Ayyyyyyyy
06/10/2020, 07:29 - Bee: It looks a lot more than just decent. ☺️
06/10/2020, 07:29 - Bee: It goes with the glasses and the short hair
06/10/2020, 07:29 - Bee: What's with the expression tho
06/10/2020, 07:52 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/10/2020, 10:43 - Nischal Abraham: It took me an hour and a half to get the thing done. I was so done by the end of it 😂
06/10/2020, 10:43 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably trim my beard today though
06/10/2020, 11:17 - Bee: The beard looks good ys
06/10/2020, 11:17 - Bee: Ya* 😑
06/10/2020, 11:17 - Bee: Is that the longest you've taken?
06/10/2020, 11:18 - Bee: Almost done for today!!! Eagerly waiting to leave so that I can listen to the rest of the podcast.
06/10/2020, 11:18 - Bee: Do you know of any more podcast musicals?
06/10/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: Unfortunately no. If you do find any let me know too
06/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: Day 2 down!
06/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe. But it gets uncomfortable after a while and I'd rather just not have to bother about it for a week
06/10/2020, 11:33 - Bee: There's one called Songonauts. It's a musical sci-fi podcast. I can't find it on Spotify. Must be there on another app
06/10/2020, 11:33 - Bee: Ahh. Does it get itchy? Does food get stuck in it?
06/10/2020, 11:34 - Nischal Abraham: I've never had food stuck in mine 😂. But it does get itchy
06/10/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Oh 😛 how would I know?! I've seen food get stuck in the movies. But the beards were longer
06/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: I'm waiting for the train. It's the perfect time to start listening to the podcast Nischal. But I don't want to. Because it'll get over
06/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: This is the same as me eating the red velvet cake for upto two weeks after my birthday
06/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: I don't want it to get over
06/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: What's your day like today?
06/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: How are you?
06/10/2020, 12:03 - Nischal Abraham: But when it gets over you can start the next thing!
06/10/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Coding, eating, trying not to waste time watching videos all day. The usual I guess
06/10/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well! It's still very chilly today so sitting in my room with my sweater on
06/10/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: How are you Debby?
06/10/2020, 13:55 - Bee: I didn't finish yet. Was on a looonnngg call with Tijy on my way back

06/10/2020, 13:56 - Bee: Cool
06/10/2020, 13:57 - Bee: Up for a short call tonight?
06/10/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: See you should've listened when you were waiting
06/10/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'd love that 😊
06/10/2020, 13:57 - Bee: Nooo I get to enjoy it for another day
06/10/2020, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: For another day. Have you reached home?
06/10/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Yep. I had a guava. I'll watch some Say yes to the dress
06/10/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun! I'll go and have some lunch as well.
06/10/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoyed a lovely walk. The weather has been great since afternoon
06/10/2020, 17:07 - Bee: Is it sunny?
06/10/2020, 17:07 - Bee: Will you be free in 40 minutes?
06/10/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'll be free
06/10/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: It was when I was out. It's gotten cloudy again

06/10/2020, 17:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
06/10/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Missed voice call
07/10/2020, 03:52 - Bee: I DONT LIKE THE ENDING
07/10/2020, 09:23 - Nischal Abraham: Ah there we go. That's the reaction I had too 😄. It starts off strong but I didn't enjoy the last act
07/10/2020, 10:47 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know if I've shared this one with you before
07/10/2020, 10:47 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/ax7f3JZJHSw
07/10/2020, 13:45 - Bee: But I get it. It's a realistic ending
07/10/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Haven't
07/10/2020, 13:46 - Bee: Is this me
07/10/2020, 13:46 - Bee: What's up?
07/10/2020, 14:11 - Bee: NORAH HASN'T FORGOTTEN ME
07/10/2020, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: Not a great day 😞
07/10/2020, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yay!!

07/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: Yes! Was on a call with Ruth and Norah
07/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: Norah was asking about you
07/10/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: Ah I guess I missed it. Came downstairs to make something to eat
07/10/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: Sadly can't take Whatsapp calls on the laptop
07/10/2020, 15:02 - Bee: Ah. Late lunch!
07/10/2020, 15:02 - Bee: ?*
07/10/2020, 15:02 - Bee: Will call you tomorrow at the same time if you're free
07/10/2020, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Dragged myself to come downstairs
07/10/2020, 15:02 - Bee: Norah is a lot more talkative now
07/10/2020, 15:03 - Bee: Would you like to get on a call?
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: No appetite?
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I can keep myself free
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Making something to eat now. Just came down
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Norah will be happy
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Ahhh
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Okay
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: I'm hungry... Just not in the mood to do anything again
07/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: I thought you couldn't pick up the call because you went down to eat
07/10/2020, 15:05 - Bee: Something easy then? Your spaghetti
07/10/2020, 15:05 - Bee: I'm free whenever/if you want to. :)
07/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/10/2020, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Awwee 🥺
07/10/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
07/10/2020, 15:10 - Bee: My day was great. :) I was asked to take a lecture today. Online. It went well :)
07/10/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Already! I thought that's from next week on?
07/10/2020, 15:11 - Bee: It wasn't scheduled for another week but there were some sudden changes because a teacher took emergency leave
07/10/2020, 15:11 - Bee: Yes. Was supposed to be from next week
07/10/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: And it went well!! That's awesome Debby! Substitute teacher achieved 😁
07/10/2020, 15:26 - Bee: It did. I was surprised. My teacher complimented me. She's also my research guide. And the university topper. It means a lot coming from her...
07/10/2020, 15:27 - Nischal Abraham: I know which teacher you're referencing by now. Maybe not by name but you've mentioned her enough for me to recognize as recurring person
07/10/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Her name is Mrs. Lekshmi Ajithlal. It'll be easy for me now that I've told you her name
07/10/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not surprised you did well though. Kind of expected if you ask me
07/10/2020, 15:28 - Bee: You've never seen me teach
07/10/2020, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: You're excited to do it... That's a mark of a good teacher if I've ever seen one
07/10/2020, 15:30 - Bee: Oh. I'm praying that it lasts. Unlike all the other things which I start with zest and it fizzles out
07/10/2020, 15:30 - Bee: I'm going to make cronuts
07/10/2020, 15:30 - Bee: Starting now. Kinda late. Should've started earlier
07/10/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: What's cronuts?
07/10/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Croissant + donut
07/10/2020, 15:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/10/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... I've never heard of that before
07/10/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know how it goes 😊
07/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: I've never had one before. Let's see how it goes
07/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: I will
07/10/2020, 16:27 - Bee: My dough is ready. Gotta wait an hour for it to rise
07/10/2020, 16:28 - Bee: The recipe mentioned the prep time to be 2 hours. I was like fine. Just two hours. But it didn't include the resting time for the dough. Which is an hour. Looks like I'll be up for some time
07/10/2020, 16:28 - Bee: I really want to take some for Tijy tomorrow
07/10/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be meeting Tijy? In college?
07/10/2020, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wait at the station right?
07/10/2020, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: So a total of 3 hours of waiting!?
07/10/2020, 16:36 - Bee: College hostel is in the same building as my college... And she has night shifts going on. So she's in the hostel when I'm in college
07/10/2020, 16:36 - Bee: One hour down. One hour of waiting. And one hour of work
07/10/2020, 16:37 - Bee: I'm tired already 🤦🏽‍♀️
07/10/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no. Did you have dinner?
07/10/2020, 16:50 - Bee: I'm having dinner rn
07/10/2020, 16:50 - Bee: What's up?
07/10/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Watching a stream. Can we talk for a bit today? It can be a short call
07/10/2020, 17:24 - Bee: I'd like that. I was going to ask you the same
07/10/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: What time would you be free?
07/10/2020, 17:27 - Bee: In an hour and a half? Is that okay?
07/10/2020, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
07/10/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free when you are
07/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Nischal
07/10/2020, 18:20 - Bee: Do you mind if I talk to you while I make cronuts? Or I can call after I'm done. I'll be up for a while anyway...
07/10/2020, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: It's up to you. If you can't talk while making them that's alright
07/10/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Why would I mind? As long as we're talking I'll be happy
07/10/2020, 18:27 - Bee: I can talk while making. I might take a while and that's why I asked. If I call after I'm done then we won't get much time to talk
07/10/2020, 18:27 - Bee: I'll call?
07/10/2020, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
08/10/2020, 04:45 - Bee: Bb. ♥️.
08/10/2020, 06:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
08/10/2020, 06:23 - Bee: I just remembered the incident that I wanted to tell you about. Making a note of it.
08/10/2020, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Pune! That was a fun trip 😌
08/10/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to hearing it. I'll be free for a call today if you are. I have some news to tell you too. Which is quite short and I could probably just message it but I'll wait till the call
08/10/2020, 11:25 - Bee: It was
08/10/2020, 11:25 - Bee: Okay. Tonight. Should I be nervous? Anxious?
08/10/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: No no. It's good news 😁. Look forward to it
08/10/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Ayyyyyyyy
08/10/2020, 11:27 - Bee: I want to get into a guessing game but I'll wait.
08/10/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Sammy Ruth have youth meeting rn
08/10/2020, 13:58 - Bee: No call with Norah
08/10/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. I'll see you at Bible study then. Are you home already?
08/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Yes. Got home half an hour ago. Jason met me at meadows. We had a shawarma. 😋
08/10/2020, 14:27 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely. How were the cronuts?
08/10/2020, 16:11 - Bee: They were alright. Could've been better. The dough should've risen some more
08/10/2020, 16:40 - Nischal Abraham: Did you manage to give it to everyone you planned to?
08/10/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Also... What time tonight?
08/10/2020, 18:06 - Bee: Hi
08/10/2020, 18:06 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
08/10/2020, 18:07 - Bee: I took a couple for Tijy. Didn't take any for the others
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Nischal
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: Hi.
08/10/2020, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: 😑
08/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: What
08/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Are you not delighted to see my messages
08/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Me, the light of your life
08/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Where did you go
08/10/2020, 18:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
08/10/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Yes
09/10/2020, 09:34 - Nischal Abraham: Installing Road rash isn't as straightforward as I thought it would be. But it is still possible
09/10/2020, 12:04 - Bee: Did you install it?
09/10/2020, 12:04 - Bee: Tell me how!
09/10/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: Well. It was a shady install that I believe is the cause of a lot of my current problems so I'd suggest you steer clear of it for now
09/10/2020, 12:07 - Bee: 😯
09/10/2020, 12:07 - Bee: What problems?
09/10/2020, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: My pc crashed and I had to reinstall windows 😅
09/10/2020, 12:08 - Bee: 😳
09/10/2020, 12:08 - Bee: Is it easy to reinstall windows?
09/10/2020, 12:08 - Bee: I have so many questions
09/10/2020, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: Well dell has a boot assist so it restored the windows. Basically factory reset for computers
09/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: So you lost all your data?
09/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: 😳
09/10/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll figure out how much I've lost later I guess. Hopefully nothing too important
09/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: Oh no
09/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: This is worse than when I lost my WhatsApp chats
09/10/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... I should've installed in my VM. I was being dumb. Lesson for next time
09/10/2020, 12:10 - Bee: What's VM?
09/10/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Virtual Machine. So you can set up a subsystem to run inside your system
09/10/2020, 12:10 - Bee: Okay?
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Nischal Abraham: I can install windows twice! Except it's running in its own application. So if it crashes I just reload the application without harming my local machine
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Bee: Oh
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Bee: Got it
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Bee: I think
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done with college for the day?
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Bee: That's cool
09/10/2020, 12:11 - Bee: I didn't know there was such a thing
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Bee: I am. In the train now
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Bee: What's up?
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Found place to sit?
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Bee: I did
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Bee: It's almost empty
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Updates installing on the laptop now
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/10/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: How was your day?
09/10/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: That is so empty!!!! 😮
09/10/2020, 12:13 - Bee: It was busy. At 12 I was told that I had to take a 2 hour class. From 2-4. I was prepared only for an hour. I skipped lunch
09/10/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Learnt my lesson. I should be prepared
09/10/2020, 12:13 - Bee: It is!!!!!!!
09/10/2020, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! How did you extend your 1 hour?
09/10/2020, 12:14 - Bee: How's your day been so far?
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Yes. Prepared for that hour from 12-2. Hence no lunch. I'm famished
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: Had breakfast, crashed my laptop, recovering my laptop. Not the best it could be 😂
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: So took a 2pm-4pm class
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Hahahaha
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: But why roadrash?!?!
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Poor child
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: So next time you'll prepare for 2 hours even if they ask you only for one?
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: I feel bad for you
09/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: Correct
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Bee: I'll always be prepared for more
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. Yea always better to be over rather than underprepared
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Bee: Yes
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Bee: What was for breakfast?
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Bee: I don't understand why people wear gloves
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Bee: They touch their face anyway
09/10/2020, 12:16 - Bee: What's the point
09/10/2020, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: Cause you mentioned it and I wanted to see how easy it is to install. It really wasn't that difficult but I did trial and error multiple different sources so one of them must've been bad
09/10/2020, 12:17 - Bee: Do you know what this reminds me of
09/10/2020, 12:17 - Bee: Why multiple? You must have found one that works right
09/10/2020, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: What?
09/10/2020, 12:17 - Bee: Guess
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: I did finally. And I think that's a good one. But the other one must've been bad and I didn't uninstall it properly
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Bee: I will tell you when we talk. I don't want to be mean. 🙈
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Bee: Ooooohhhh so you road rash now
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: Mean to whom?
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Bee: Practice punching and kicking
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Bee: You obv
09/10/2020, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: It reminds you of me?
09/10/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Reminds me of an incident in your life that happened around 8 (?) years ago.
09/10/2020, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: I don't remember... Did I misuse gloves?
09/10/2020, 12:20 - Bee: No no no no
09/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: This is unrelated
09/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: The sentence 'whats the point'
09/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: Nothing to do with gloves
09/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: Have you used gloves?
09/10/2020, 12:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! I thought you were referencing gloves
09/10/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: For warmth
09/10/2020, 12:22 - Bee: Ahhhh yes
09/10/2020, 12:22 - Bee: Nope
09/10/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know. Can't think of anything still
09/10/2020, 12:22 - Bee: Clue : Aprajita (is that how it's spelt?)
09/10/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: OH NO! 🙁
09/10/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Aparajita
09/10/2020, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: I remember. How unfortunate that I do
09/10/2020, 12:23 - Bee: *Aparajita
09/10/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Why unfortunate
09/10/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: It's embarrassing! 😖
09/10/2020, 12:24 - Bee: I won't mention it for the rest of this month promise
09/10/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: No no that's okay. It is what it is. Old me was a naive little boy
09/10/2020, 12:25 - Bee: Old you?
09/10/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: Old as in past
09/10/2020, 12:25 - Bee: Jk.
09/10/2020, 12:25 - Bee: I got it
09/10/2020, 12:25 - Bee: I meant
Who said present you isn't
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: Present me is naive young adult who still doesn't know any better
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: BUT IM JOKING OFC
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: Ahhhhhhhh
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: Cool
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: You're an adult
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: Patrick is a young adult
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: Are you?? 🤨
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: Why do you think?
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: Nope
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: What****
09/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: 🤦🏽‍♀️
09/10/2020, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: I am. But I'm only as mature as a young adult
09/10/2020, 12:27 - Bee: And not a little boy?
09/10/2020, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: Not a little boy. But the naivety is still the same
09/10/2020, 12:27 - Bee: Okay
09/10/2020, 12:28 - Bee: I think you're wiser. I know you're wiser. But I only know about the past year
09/10/2020, 12:29 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope so. I don't know if wise people end up crashing their machine after getting a master's degree in computers
09/10/2020, 12:29 - Bee: Hahahahaha
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Wise people don't download from multiple sources if one is already working
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Why would you do that
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Why multiple trial and error
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Is there some scientific reason?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Is there?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Nischal?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Nischal?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Is there?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Hello?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Nischal?
09/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: ♥️
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hi?
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: I'm feeling cute
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: The last one worked
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: You are cute
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Ah. Got it
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Thank you nana
09/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: I know
09/10/2020, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Make sure to feel it always then 😊
09/10/2020, 12:32 - Bee: Impossible
09/10/2020, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: But it's who you are. It doesn't change with how you feel
09/10/2020, 12:33 - Bee: That's true
09/10/2020, 12:34 - Bee: Is your laptop okay?
09/10/2020, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: It works! But data is gone
09/10/2020, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: And I'll have to set up all my customisations again
09/10/2020, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: It feels like I bought a new laptop 😂
09/10/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Oh ☹️
09/10/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Did you have your data backed up?
09/10/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: Na it's fine. I had some backed up. Some others I didn't. I think most of the important stuff should be backed up already
09/10/2020, 12:38 - Nischal Abraham: The problem is I won't remember immediately what is missing. Over time when I need it I'll realise
09/10/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Aw :(
09/10/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Do you still have the game at least?
09/10/2020, 12:39 - Bee: The reason why all of this happened
09/10/2020, 12:39 - Bee: But if everything is gone then must've been lost too
09/10/2020, 12:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yea game is gone too. I won't be installing it again. I played a bit of it but I don't think I'll enjoy it long-term anyway
09/10/2020, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: The nostalgia hit for the first few minutes but after that it ends up being an old racing game
09/10/2020, 12:49 - Bee: Oh. I don't want it anymore 😶
09/10/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Nooo. I'm sure you'll have an opportunity to enjoy it. Don't let my bad experience discourage you
09/10/2020, 13:04 - Bee: If anything happens to my data I definitely wouldn't take  it as well as you have
09/10/2020, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Ah well everything is fleeting temporary stuff. I can't undo what is done so I'll just have to work with what I have
09/10/2020, 13:22 - Bee: I would've arrived at the logic after crying for 10 minutes
09/10/2020, 13:23 - Bee: I finally had lunch! Making me lethargic now
09/10/2020, 13:23 - Bee: I've been requested to make my infamous beef curry 😎
09/10/2020, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: For dinner?
09/10/2020, 14:05 - Bee: For Sunday lunch. I'll cook tomorrow evening
09/10/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: I just got off a call with my parents. Going to have lunch now.
09/10/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Ah nice. Sounds lovely 😊
09/10/2020, 18:01 - Bee: I fell asleep. Just woke up. 😶
09/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Thats a long afternoon nap
09/10/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Yes. Skipping lunch did no good
09/10/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Didn't realize how tired I was until my back hit the mattress
09/10/2020, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby 😞. How are you feeling now?
09/10/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Confused. Still in a daze. Don't know what to do
09/10/2020, 18:12 - Bee: I should go have dinner
09/10/2020, 18:12 - Bee: That's what I'll do
09/10/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like a good plan 😊
09/10/2020, 18:12 - Bee: What are you doing?
09/10/2020, 18:13 - Bee: How's your day been so far?
09/10/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Go have dinner. I guess people would still be up right?
09/10/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Yep
09/10/2020, 18:13 - Nischal Abraham: Slowly restoring my laptop to normalcy. I've installed most of the things that I had before
09/10/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Oh
09/10/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: It's been alright. I realise the most important documents I'm missing are my drafts of resumes and cover letters that didn't get backed up for some reason
09/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Oh no. Drafts of resume are fine (maybe?) But what about cover letters now?
09/10/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I have backup of the resume in gmail with people I mailed it to
09/10/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just have to write another original cover letter through the format and use that as my new template
09/10/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
09/10/2020, 18:23 - Bee: There's rice, more, and an egg side dish
09/10/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: Nice! Is that how more is spelt in english? Somehow feels wrong
09/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: 😂 I don't know
09/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: I don't know of any other way to spell it. Yes it does feel wrong
09/10/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe mor?
09/10/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: But idk either... Let's go with more
09/10/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Feels better than more
09/10/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Well enjoy your rice moar and eggs 😂
09/10/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Hahahahahha
09/10/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I will enjoy my rice, mohr, and eggs
09/10/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: How was dinner?
09/10/2020, 19:16 - Bee: I'm still eating 😶
09/10/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Are you free for a short call?
09/10/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I am. Are you?
09/10/2020, 19:17 - Bee: In 5?
09/10/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
09/10/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be here
09/10/2020, 19:20 - Bee: Hi
09/10/2020, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
09/10/2020, 19:20 - Bee: I'll call?
09/10/2020, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
10/10/2020, 08:21 - Bee: My day is going by so fast! Done with classes for today. Prepping for next week now. Today's went really well Nischal. The kids were more responsive than the previous classes, I'm sure they understood today's
10/10/2020, 08:21 - Bee: I hope you have a splendid day :)
10/10/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: That is amazing!
10/10/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: I hope so too
10/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: It's raining heavily and I don't have an umbrella
10/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: I'm going to wait for a bit. My train is at 4:30
10/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: But it doesn't look like it's going to stop
10/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: It's raining heavier now
10/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: My messages aren't going
10/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: Live commentary is no longer live
10/10/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Did you make it?
10/10/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Why no umbrella?
10/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: It hasn't rained in a while. I thought monsoon might be over
10/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Yep
10/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Did I tell you that this monsoon was the only one when I didn't get drenched completely? That's no longer true
10/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: I'm enjoying the weather tho. Can't wait to get home and sit by the window. After a hit water bath of course
10/10/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: Won't your bag have gotten wet as well?
10/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: No. My bag came with a detachable waterproof cover
10/10/2020, 12:14 - Bee: r/PepTalksWithPops has such wholesome posts
10/10/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome. I need me one of those
10/10/2020, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lot of wisdom and life lessons
10/10/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you would love to get drenched
10/10/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Yep. I'm alright
10/10/2020, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: hit water baths are my favourite 😂
10/10/2020, 12:53 - Bee: Ahh. I can't bear hot water baths. Warm water does it for me
10/10/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea same. I think there's a time for both warm or cold showers for me. I remember enjoying both and hating both at different times
10/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Yes definitely. I didn't have warm water at my hostel in Vashi. Two winters were spent taking the quickest showers in chilling watet
10/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: And I would take loooooonnnnnggg showers whenever I would come home.
10/10/2020, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: So did you enjoy your shower? What's for dinner? How tired are you>
10/10/2020, 17:34 - Bee: I did. I had kanji (brown rice with the water it's boiled in? Is it called kanji in Malayalam?) and jackfruit vegetable. Have you had cooked jackfruit?
10/10/2020, 17:34 - Bee: I am tired. Applying a clay mask wasn't a good idea. Now I have to wait for it to dry and only then go to sleep
10/10/2020, 17:35 - Bee: Can we push tonight's call to tomorrow?
10/10/2020, 17:35 - Bee: I know you'll graciously say yes
10/10/2020, 17:35 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/10/2020, 17:36 - Bee: As a gift
10/10/2020, 17:36 - Bee: What's up?
10/10/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Sure!
10/10/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Of course 😂
10/10/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: You got a face mask as a gift?
10/10/2020, 17:37 - Bee: No. The photo is a gift for you
10/10/2020, 17:38 - Bee: I am a gift for you Nischal
10/10/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: I've been setting up my coding environment for the most part... Restoring computer to normalcy (part 2)
10/10/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Aiyyo. Its taking more than a day?!
10/10/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: That you are.... Thank you for the gift Bee 😊
10/10/2020, 17:38 - Bee: Will you be done today? With the setting up
10/10/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: What does the clay mask do?
10/10/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yea yea I'm done for the most part. Its just random things that pop up when I try to do something new
10/10/2020, 17:39 - Bee: :)))) you are my gift Nischal
10/10/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: And then I realise I hadn't fixed that thing yet
10/10/2020, 17:39 - Bee: How do you set up your coding environment? Are there applications that you have to install?
10/10/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. So there's an editor called Visual Studio Code and a bunch of extensions on that
10/10/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: And then for open source I have to configure my laptop to be allowed to push stuff onto the website
10/10/2020, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: So there's a bunch of permissions to be setup
10/10/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Oh. There's all kinds of coding languages on it?
10/10/2020, 17:42 - Bee: I wanted your help with something
10/10/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Ask away
10/10/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Is there a way for me to disable my caps lock key?
10/10/2020, 17:43 - Bee: There's no option for it in my settings
10/10/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Coding languages don't exist on anything. They are just languages... So software is only to interpret them
10/10/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Disable completely? Why would you want to do that?
10/10/2020, 17:43 - Bee: I accidentally click on it and at times don't realise because I look at my keyboard and type instead of looking at the screen unlike some superheroes
10/10/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Wow... I must say that's a first. Doesn't your keyboard have an indicator to tell you if caps is on or not?
10/10/2020, 17:44 - Bee: It does. But the light is too small
10/10/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Also if you're looking at your keyboard, wouldn't you be sure not to hit the Caps key? Like there is a way to disable it but I
10/10/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'd recommend not to*
10/10/2020, 17:45 - Bee: If I disable it there's no way to enable it when I want to?
10/10/2020, 17:45 - Bee: Okay
10/10/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: You can enable it after... But it's not a straightforward process. You'll be telling your computer that the button doesn't exist. Basically changing the internal structure of your hardware not just windows
10/10/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: I think it would be far easier to learn to type better 😂
10/10/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Okay. Nevermind then. I'll try to hold my frustration in when it happens
10/10/2020, 17:47 - Bee: I didn't realize how bad I was until I had to make so many ppts
10/10/2020, 17:47 - Nischal Abraham: So on a laptop you can start by looking at the space between your keyboard and screen no? Then it's in your peripheral
10/10/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Do you type with both your pointer fingers?
10/10/2020, 17:49 - Bee: And other fingers too but mostly pointers
10/10/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/47206-how-enable-disable-caps-lock-key-windows-10-a.html
If you're really really frustrated. Just be warned if you mess up you may disable an unintended key and then it'll be nigh impossible to fix that
10/10/2020, 17:49 - Bee: The space between my keyboard and screen?
10/10/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Tip 1: Make use of the Shift key to capitalize. Never use Caps Lock unless you want a full sentence in caps
10/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/10/2020, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
10/10/2020, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Exactly!
10/10/2020, 17:51 - Bee: How will I know what I'm typing then?
10/10/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: You can see it in your peripheral vision
10/10/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Okay
10/10/2020, 17:52 - Bee: No I won't do it
10/10/2020, 17:53 - Bee: Maybe by the end of the month I'll be better at typing
10/10/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Tip 2: Don't cross over your right and left hand to the opposite side as much as possible. This includes even the numbers. Numbers 5/6 can be your mid point
10/10/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Noted
10/10/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Give me more tips!!
10/10/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Tip 3: Thumb is for spaces. Always thumb
10/10/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Tip 4: Use your pinky for the shift button. You could even practice typing a full caps sentence using only the Shift button. So keep it held down without lifting your finger for a whole sentence
10/10/2020, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: LIKE THIS SENTENCE THAT APPEARS TO BE ME SHOUTING BUT I'M ACTUALLY JUST HOLDING DOWN THE SHIFT KEY
10/10/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: But at the end of the day it just comes over time. I'm sure as you keep having to type more you'll get the hang of it
10/10/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: The thing is you must be familiar with the layout already too.... Phone keyboard has qwerty on it as well
10/10/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: If you can type quickly on the phone you should "theoretically" be fast on the computer too
10/10/2020, 18:08 - Bee: I have oily skin. It controls the oil for a bit
10/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: I can type quickly on the phone. But there's autocorrect which helps
10/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Noted
10/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: And noted
10/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING
10/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Some things sound better shouted out 😂
10/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... I just wash my face a lot... But then again I have done nothing in terms of skincare which is quite a stereotypical guy thing to do
10/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: And yet guys have amazing skin. Unfair. I'll never understand
10/10/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: There are guys with not amazing skin... and there are girls with amazing skin as well
10/10/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Washing my fave often dries it out
10/10/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think its gender related to have good skin
10/10/2020, 18:27 - Bee: Ashley does nothing for his skin. Doesn't even wash it properly with water. But look at him
10/10/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's been a while since I have so I don't know. Maybe that's the secret... It's to do less 😮
10/10/2020, 18:32 - Bee: I've done that too. Still the same
10/10/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Have you done it for 25 years?
10/10/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Maybe it's a guy thing
10/10/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Nope
10/10/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's your problem then 😂
10/10/2020, 18:33 - Bee: I haven't been alive for 25 years
10/10/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: .
10/10/2020, 18:34 - Bee: That I haven't been alive for 25 years?
10/10/2020, 18:34 - Bee: What's up? Still setting up?
10/10/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: No no... I'm done with that for the day. It's another chilly day so I'm just in my room. I need to fold up my clothers
10/10/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: clothes*. What're you upto?
10/10/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Going to sleep soon?
10/10/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Yes
10/10/2020, 18:36 - Bee: I'm all ready and in bed
10/10/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. Rest plenty Bee! Hope worship is a great time tomorrow 😊
10/10/2020, 18:37 - Bee: I'm losing a lot of hair Nischal. Please pray that I don't
10/10/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Sounds silly but it's a worry
10/10/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Don't worry... I've heard that's a reason for hair fall too
10/10/2020, 18:38 - Bee: 😶
10/10/2020, 18:38 - Bee: If only it was that easy
10/10/2020, 18:39 - Bee: ☺️
10/10/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Bye Nischal. ☺️
10/10/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!

11/10/2020, 08:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/10/2020, 08:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/10/2020, 08:19 - Bee: Good morning, bb!
11/10/2020, 09:09 - Nischal Abraham: Why is the book upside down? 😂
11/10/2020, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: Such a cute little bundle of joy. Must've been a lovely call. When was the last time you spoke to them?
11/10/2020, 09:10 - Nischal Abraham: Hope worship was good Bee. I'll message more later in the day. Have a good one!
11/10/2020, 12:56 - Bee: That's what I asked her too. The answers to the riddles were written upside down
11/10/2020, 12:57 - Bee: It was a lovely call. I've been invited for dinner on Wednesday. I'll get to see the kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11/10/2020, 12:57 - Bee: The last time I had a video call with AAA was 3 weeks ago
11/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Worship was good. :) How was yours? Done with lunch?
11/10/2020, 13:00 - Bee: Nischal, the beef turned out really good ☺️
11/10/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Worship was good here too. Not yet done with lunch. Excited you get to see the kids! 😊
11/10/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's good! What did you have with it?
11/10/2020, 13:23 - Bee: There was Dal, jeera rice, chana vegetable with coconut
11/10/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely 😋. What're you upto now?
11/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: This
11/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: What're you up to?
11/10/2020, 15:00 - Bee: Done with lunch?
11/10/2020, 15:01 - Bee: We played I spy over video call
11/10/2020, 15:01 - Bee: A modified version. Kitto taught me how to play it
11/10/2020, 15:05 - Bee: How is my bb today?
11/10/2020, 15:06 - Bee: Will my bb be free for a call tonight?
11/10/2020, 15:12 - Bee: My bb is the best
11/10/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Yep just got out of the kitchen
11/10/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. Teach me also when we talk
11/10/2020, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: Doing good
11/10/2020, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
11/10/2020, 15:26 - Nischal Abraham: Did you talk to kids too much?
11/10/2020, 15:36 - Bee: ?
11/10/2020, 15:36 - Bee: I shall
11/10/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Okay
11/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Yay!
11/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Your bb is doing good too
11/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: I talked a lot but definitely not enough. Why?
11/10/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Well the way you keep repeating bb sounds like you're talking to a kid 😂
11/10/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Agreed my maturity is that of a kid, but just feels like you got into a flow
11/10/2020, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: Putting my documents in order for my visa visit to the Garda on Tuesday
11/10/2020, 16:57 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/10/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's beautiful! And the necklace is pretty too
11/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Thank you!
11/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: In 20?
11/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Is that okay?
11/10/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep 👍
11/10/2020, 18:50 - Bee: Hi
11/10/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
11/10/2020, 18:50 - Bee: I'll call?
11/10/2020, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
12/10/2020, 06:52 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/10/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon to you too 😂
12/10/2020, 09:27 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going? I had such lovely sleep!! Didn't feel like getting up at all. But I had to get up on time today because I need to wake up early tomorrow which means I need to sleep early tonight
12/10/2020, 12:05 - Bee: Doesn't that guy look a little like you?
12/10/2020, 12:05 - Bee: If you squint and look
12/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: My day has been going splendidly so far. ☺️ I'm on my way back
12/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Photocopying done?
12/10/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: I don't see it... But if you do I believe you
12/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Not even when you squint?
12/10/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Nope... Its been a rainy morning and I'm hoping the weather clears up by evening
12/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Okay
12/10/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: Thats nice... 2 hour lecture?
12/10/2020, 12:07 - Bee: The place you mentioned will do photocopies for you?
12/10/2020, 12:07 - Bee: Yes. 2-4
12/10/2020, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: I need a printout more urgently than photocopies... If they do that I'll be happy
12/10/2020, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
12/10/2020, 12:08 - Bee: Ahh. You called and checked?
12/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: Okay. I'll wear my glasses and look again
12/10/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. The printing place only opens at 2
12/10/2020, 12:15 - Bee: What plans until then?
12/10/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Was coding in the morning. No other plans than to go get printouts
12/10/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: OH and I was playing some guitar
12/10/2020, 12:28 - Bee: Random melodies?
12/10/2020, 12:28 - Bee: Or songs?
12/10/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Trying to learn this https://youtu.be/ViybIadsxKI
12/10/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: And recalling how to play Silent Sea by KT Tunstall
12/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: The name sound familiar. Isn't there a song by the same artist in the For a friend playlist?
12/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Yes
12/10/2020, 12:31 - Bee: Under the weather
12/10/2020, 12:42 - Bee: Dude, so complicated 😮
12/10/2020, 12:49 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yep.... Silent sea was the song I discovered her from
12/10/2020, 12:49 - Nischal Abraham: https://open.spotify.com/track/51l1ZjYZkaJhH77YX73oyn
12/10/2020, 12:50 - Nischal Abraham: But so fun! That song has become a meme but if I can play it like that it'll be so cool
12/10/2020, 13:10 - Bee: The song Wonderwall or this version of it?
12/10/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Meme
12/10/2020, 13:10 - Bee: I'm guessing the song has become a meme
12/10/2020, 13:10 - Bee: Thanks to you, I'm Binge watching Sorted Food videos
12/10/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: You guessed right. It's a guitar meme where anyone who plays acoustic guitar always starts with wonderwall because it's easy to play
12/10/2020, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: They're funny right?
12/10/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Hi bb
12/10/2020, 16:48 - Bee: I went to sleep for a bit. 'For a bit' turned to 3.5 hours
12/10/2020, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: 3.5 < 4
12/10/2020, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: Are you refreshed or groggy?
12/10/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Ofc but relevant how
12/10/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Groggy.
12/10/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Then I guess it was too much... Sounds like you're having exhausting days... Want to skip on call today and head to bed early?
12/10/2020, 16:49 - Bee: They are!!!
12/10/2020, 16:49 - Bee: I try to pick one favourite but they're all funny in their own way
12/10/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Even if we skip on a call there's no heading to bed early. I'm slightly behind on my prep. I need to do that after I'm done with dinner
12/10/2020, 16:52 - Bee: Did you get your work done? Are you outside?
12/10/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: I got back 50 min ago. Got my printouts but I'll have to manage with the copies that I already have
12/10/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Covid has made them very closed so I could only mail my prints and go collect them. They want minimal time in the shop
12/10/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: But I'm glad at least that was available in Kilcock 😊. It cost 1 EUR for 2 pages... Which I was thinking was a reasonable price till I converted to INR 😂
12/10/2020, 16:54 - Bee: Oh. You have everything you'll need for tomorrow?
12/10/2020, 16:54 - Bee: But they can keep rock climbing open
12/10/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Minus effective gloves... Well I'll refrain from touching my face and I hope that'll be fine
12/10/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Hawwwwwwwwwwww. That's a lot more expensive than the already expensive food 😂
12/10/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Oh gloves. They sell them in bulk?
12/10/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Rock climbing peeps aren't afraid of no virus
12/10/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Still not over this
12/10/2020, 16:56 - Bee: What are they thinking
12/10/2020, 16:56 - Bee: I'm sure it doesn't cost them that much
12/10/2020, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Nope... Didn't find them at all... Probably might have been in a medical store but I could care less at this point
12/10/2020, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Well it is a convenience thing... And the overhead probably does depending on how many people request prints
12/10/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Obv in a medical store no nana
12/10/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Yeah. So India one ups Ireland when it comes to cheap Chinese and not printouts
12/10/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Now*
12/10/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: India 1ups on anything needed cheaper. It's just the way the currency holds value
12/10/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Also, India has me. That's the ultimate one up
12/10/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: But you being in India is a variable
12/10/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Correct
12/10/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: What's up? Done with dinner?
12/10/2020, 17:28 - Bee: Just sat down to eat. There's chicken and soya chucks curry with rice
12/10/2020, 17:28 - Bee: What's your opinion about soya chunks?
12/10/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh like soya!
12/10/2020, 17:30 - Bee: You like soya?
12/10/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I see I missed an "I" there. Yes I like soya chunks. What about you?
12/10/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I like soya chunks if they're added to a non vegetarian dish. Not fond of it if it's cooked by itself
12/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... I've only had 1 or 2 preparations of it... And I've liked both so far
12/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: My mom makes them like beef
12/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: beef curry*
12/10/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Ooooooh. That sounds delicious
12/10/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Maa adds then to chicken or mutton curry
12/10/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Them*
12/10/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds delicious too!
12/10/2020, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: My mom used to do that to get Achu to eat them
12/10/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Achu got royal treatment eh
12/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: I have no motivation to do what I need to do
12/10/2020, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: What do you need to do?
12/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: Make notes for tomorrow's class
12/10/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Two hours?
12/10/2020, 18:26 - Bee: Yes
12/10/2020, 18:26 - Bee: I'm going to do as much as I can in an hour
12/10/2020, 18:27 - Bee: And hopefully I'll want to continue and finish it off
12/10/2020, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: 👍. Want me to check in on you in an hour?
12/10/2020, 18:28 - Bee: Yes, please!
12/10/2020, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Will do 😊. All the best!!
12/10/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Will you be free for a short call in an hour?
12/10/2020, 19:00 - Bee: You're gonna sleep early right. It's okay if there's no call. We can talk tomorrow
12/10/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be free for a call. Early means before 12am my time
12/10/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Okay. Nischal, in 15?
12/10/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Cool
12/10/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: How's it going?
12/10/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Almost done
12/10/2020, 19:32 - Bee: ')
12/10/2020, 19:32 - Bee: :)*
12/10/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome 😁
12/10/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Hi
12/10/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
12/10/2020, 19:39 - Bee: I'll call?
12/10/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
13/10/2020, 08:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/10/2020, 08:30 - Bee: Hey! Praying that everything goes well :)
13/10/2020, 08:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/10/2020, 08:32 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee. Hope your day's going well too 😊
13/10/2020, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: And here you were worried she'd forget you 😂
13/10/2020, 10:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/10/2020, 10:13 - Bee: I sent her a video and this was her response watching it
13/10/2020, 10:14 - Bee: It is! Finished a two hour class in the morning and spoke to Norah for a while after
13/10/2020, 10:14 - Nischal Abraham: I'm done with my visit! Waiting for the bus back now. Don't know how long it'll take to get here
13/10/2020, 10:14 - Nischal Abraham: Oh none in the afternoon?
13/10/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Oh
13/10/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Did you recharge your phone?
13/10/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Nope
13/10/2020, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I can't make a long distance trip without internet. That'd be careless of me
13/10/2020, 10:17 - Bee: LOOK AT THAT SMILE
13/10/2020, 10:17 - Bee: I typed this with my pinky finger on shift
13/10/2020, 10:17 - Bee: True. Now you have to finish it off
13/10/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you're using WhatsApp on your laptop?
13/10/2020, 10:18 - Bee: Yes nana
13/10/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Working on your research?
13/10/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Na. It's served its purpose today. And when I need it I'll use it
13/10/2020, 10:20 - Bee: Nope. Preparing for tomorrow's class
13/10/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice! Then you'll be free when you get home 😊
13/10/2020, 10:20 - Bee: Sammy is challenging me for a game of ludo
13/10/2020, 10:21 - Bee: Yes
13/10/2020, 10:21 - Bee: Poor chap is looking for someone to play ludo with
13/10/2020, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I can join!
13/10/2020, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: My bus is gonna take a while
13/10/2020, 10:22 - Bee: I told Sammy
13/10/2020, 10:22 - Bee: Message him!!!!
13/10/2020, 10:23 - Bee: He said they're waiting for Ruth
13/10/2020, 10:23 - Bee: Havent started yet
13/10/2020, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I messaged him
13/10/2020, 11:49 - Bee: Congrats on coming second
13/10/2020, 12:12 - Nischal Abraham: Second?
13/10/2020, 12:20 - Bee: Ludo?
13/10/2020, 12:53 - Bee: I forgot to ask you
13/10/2020, 12:53 - Bee: Was not having gloves a problem?
13/10/2020, 13:00 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I had my warm gloves but I don't think not having any would've been an issue
13/10/2020, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't come second
13/10/2020, 13:21 - Bee: Ah then you won. Because I know Josh lost
13/10/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: No I definitely lost... It gave a message saying I lost
13/10/2020, 13:33 - Bee: Oh? I don't know then
13/10/2020, 13:33 - Bee: I take this back
13/10/2020, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: Noooo.... Now I have no congrats 😞
13/10/2020, 13:54 - Bee: You gotta win buddy
13/10/2020, 13:54 - Bee: What's up?
13/10/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: I feel like its been such a long day already... feel really tired having woken up before sunrise
13/10/2020, 14:03 - Bee: Eat and sleep early then. Any other plans?
13/10/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Not really... Do you want to talk today?
13/10/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Do you want to?
13/10/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yes I do
13/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I do too
13/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Unless you're sleepy and want to go to sleep
13/10/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be free for one?
13/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I will be
13/10/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: I'm thinking of taking a nap now
13/10/2020, 14:08 - Bee: Okay
13/10/2020, 14:08 - Bee: Lunch done?
13/10/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Since I was at maynooth I got a fried chicken wrap from there
13/10/2020, 14:09 - Bee: Ooh. Sounds yum 😋
13/10/2020, 14:09 - Bee: I want a chicken wrap now.
13/10/2020, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: It's only €3.75 + 1 drink
13/10/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll go nap now. Talk later 😊
13/10/2020, 14:11 - Bee: Bye! Sleep well. Which you will. Because you woke up early. Wonderful sleep. Bye.
13/10/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Bb
13/10/2020, 17:45 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
13/10/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
13/10/2020, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5 min?
13/10/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Sure
13/10/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hey I'm free now
13/10/2020, 18:09 - Bee: I'll call?
13/10/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
14/10/2020, 09:45 - Bee: Yo.
14/10/2020, 09:45 - Bee: Slept well?
14/10/2020, 09:45 - Bee: Evening plans are cancelled :(
14/10/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: Slept too well. Why are they cancelled?
14/10/2020, 11:38 - Bee: Some neighbors saw Johnny and Siby aunty leave least night and they had a problem. So they've put up a notice that no visitors are allowed
14/10/2020, 11:38 - Bee: I should've visited before Johnny and Siby aunty 😭
14/10/2020, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! That's unfortunate 🙁
14/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Yeah :(
14/10/2020, 12:06 - Bee: Maybe we'll take them out on Saturday. Just a drive
14/10/2020, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds nice too. How's college been today?
14/10/2020, 12:29 - Bee: College was alright. Tiring. No lectures. Some students came to college to demonstrate a few nursing procedures they had learnt before lockdown. I was supervising those
14/10/2020, 12:29 - Bee: How's your day going?
14/10/2020, 12:32 - Nischal Abraham: Late start. Got up at 9:30 and don't really have much of a plan for what to do
14/10/2020, 12:53 - Bee: Other than prayer meeting
14/10/2020, 13:06 - Bee: https://youtu.be/Y8LY6U0TjN4
14/10/2020, 13:18 - Bee: And a call?
14/10/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: That is gold 😁
14/10/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sure!
14/10/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: What time will you be free for a call?
14/10/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Hi bb
14/10/2020, 17:22 - Bee: I'm sorry about the late reply. Been a little occupied
14/10/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Is my 10:45 okay? In an hour
14/10/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
14/10/2020, 17:57 - Bee: In 30 instead? 😶
14/10/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
14/10/2020, 20:16 - Bee: Hey, it was lovely seeing you. :). Goodnight!
No need to reply.
15/10/2020, 05:29 - Bee: My beloved
15/10/2020, 06:02 - Bee: All the love songs I listen to are about you now. I am forever grateful to God for bringing me in the centre of His will because being there means being with you. 
On our last call you told me that not a word I speak will fall to the ground. That moment (among many others) served as a reminder that I am not worthy to receive and cherish this gift, Nischal. It is the best gift ever. You are the best gift ever. Second only to the miraculous gift of salvation I have. Thank you for being you. And thank you for creating a space where I can be me. I wish I could show the teenage me a glimpse of what I have now. She'd be wildly surprised. That her Marshmallow is a million times better than what she imagined and wished for. I really don't know why I'm telling you all of this. I was thinking and praying and looking back and just wanted to let you know.
15/10/2020, 06:07 - Bee: There isn't much I can do from here to show you how much you mean to me. I'll leave that for later for when we're under the same roof. Consider this a reminder which, I'm praying, will be matched by my deeds in the days to come. I love you. Truly, madly, deeply (that's a song by Savage Garden).
15/10/2020, 06:08 - Bee: I'm going to get back to my PPT making.
15/10/2020, 06:08 - Bee: Good morning, bb. :)
15/10/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! You've left me speechless in the morning Bee. My heart feels full
15/10/2020, 09:59 - Nischal Abraham: I cherish you. And I don't think I'm capable of showing you how much you mean to me even under the same roof. I've been blessed enough to experience your love with the distance between us
15/10/2020, 10:00 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun preparing! Is this for teaching online or for your research?
15/10/2020, 13:16 - Bee: My internet pack is over
15/10/2020, 13:17 - Bee: There's a medical condition called Pericardial effusion in which one's heart feels full... Should I be worried?
15/10/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Pinterest told me that distance makes the heart grow fonder
15/10/2020, 13:18 - Bee: ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
15/10/2020, 13:19 - Bee: What's up?
15/10/2020, 13:19 - Bee: For teaching online
15/10/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: I think you know better than me if you should be worried or not. Is it a fatal condition?
15/10/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: Reached home?
15/10/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: I learnt that from movies and sayings
15/10/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: Eating lunch now. Was prepping lunch earlier so I couldn't reply when you messaged
15/10/2020, 14:32 - Bee: It is fatal. I don't think you have it. You might be suffering from a vitamin deficiency tho. Vitamin ME.
15/10/2020, 14:32 - Bee: 😂
15/10/2020, 14:32 - Bee: That was bad.
15/10/2020, 14:32 - Bee: I did. An hour ish ago
15/10/2020, 14:33 - Bee: Will you be there for the Bible study?
15/10/2020, 14:33 - Bee: Also, call tonight if you're free?
15/10/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: I think so too
15/10/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
15/10/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
15/10/2020, 14:46 - Bee: Cool. Looking forward to it :)
15/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: Hey!
15/10/2020, 18:24 - Bee: In an hour?
15/10/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
15/10/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be free
15/10/2020, 18:25 - Bee: Okay
15/10/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Heads up : will have to be a short call :(
15/10/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay. Is it difficult to get on a call today?
15/10/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Short call will be fine
15/10/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Hi
15/10/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/10/2020, 19:34 - Bee: I'll call?
15/10/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
16/10/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Nischal!!! No lectures today. Which means no need to complete my lesson plan. Which i didn't complete anyway. I need to catch up on sleep
16/10/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Good morning :)
16/10/2020, 08:51 - Bee: Gentle reminder - Patti's birthday.
16/10/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy!! Did you still have supervision though?
16/10/2020, 10:18 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you Debby 😊
16/10/2020, 11:43 - Bee: I did. Was on my feet the whole day. I'm going to take a looonnngg nap once I'm home
16/10/2020, 11:43 - Bee: How's your day going?
16/10/2020, 11:55 - Nischal Abraham: The weather can't seem to make up it's mind on whether it wants to stay sunny or rainy today
16/10/2020, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: Other than that I played a bit of guitar in the morning. Planning on trying out Moodle locally and messaging Gareth about my findings
16/10/2020, 12:09 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/pWzl9Sdk0aI
16/10/2020, 13:28 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/10/2020, 13:28 - Bee: SAME. It was the sunniest clearest day in the morning and so I didn't carry my umbrella. Obviously it rained in the evening 🤦🏽‍♀️
16/10/2020, 13:29 - Bee: Brb
16/10/2020, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: Still no umbrella 🤦🏽‍♂️
16/10/2020, 13:32 - Nischal Abraham: Is that shawarma?
16/10/2020, 13:41 - Bee: It is. Sent the same photo to Reenee. She and Rolf are on their way now 😂
16/10/2020, 13:41 - Bee: Jolly's name is Gareth?
16/10/2020, 13:41 - Bee: Did you plan on going out?
16/10/2020, 13:41 - Bee: Will listen to it once I'm home
16/10/2020, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: Aww I'm missing out. 😢. Enjoy yourself!
16/10/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Who's Jolly? Gareth and Maggie are the ones who handle PBS here
16/10/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: I did... But maybe not if it stays rainy
16/10/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: I stumbled on this yesterday... It's got nice harmonies 😊
16/10/2020, 15:11 - Bee: I'm full. If we didn't have our weekly family prayer, I would have gone to sleep rn and woken up tomorrow only
16/10/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea that's today! Hope you manage to stay up 😂. According to your logic you'll be hungry again by dinner so I'm sure you'll be fine in tim
16/10/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: time*
16/10/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Not if I go to sleep before dinner time
16/10/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Who's Holly then?
16/10/2020, 15:13 - Bee: Holly's husband is Jolly
16/10/2020, 15:13 - Bee: I did. Had two shawarmas.
16/10/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣. Yea well if her husband is Jolly then it can't be Gareth no
16/10/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Holly is another person. I think she and her husband run it from northern Ireland but not too sure
16/10/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: I met her during my trek up north with Timon just before lockdown
16/10/2020, 15:16 - Bee: No Jolly is the name I gave him because you didn't remember and also because it rhymes with Holly no
16/10/2020, 15:16 - Bee: Oh

17/10/2020, 13:13 - Bee: I'm craving another shawarma man
17/10/2020, 13:13 - Bee: Slept well I'm guessing?

17/10/2020, 13:20 - Bee: Busy. My throat hurts. I'm not going to be a teacher. To much talking to do.
17/10/2020, 13:20 - Bee: I'm leaving in a few to take AAA out
17/10/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: A friend from college wanted help with a question and I ended up trying to solve it

17/10/2020, 19:53 - Bee: I do

17/10/2020, 22:29 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/10/2020, 22:30 - Nischal Abraham: It was fun seeing this crowd after months. (It doesn't feel like months cause I'm still in the same place when I saw them last on Zoom)
17/10/2020, 22:31 - Nischal Abraham: (Gareth and Maggie - top right)
18/10/2020, 08:29 - Bee: Why is your screen in black and white?

18/10/2020, 08:34 - Bee: Who is Holly?!?!
18/10/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: Cause my camera was being weird and making it yellow so I put on a filter to be less bright
18/10/2020, 09:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yep there's people from there. Though I just call them the STEP crowd since that's where I first met them
18/10/2020, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: Holly's someone else. If I ever encounter a call with her I'll share and let you know

18/10/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well. It's a cold cloudy day but I'm hoping to get some walking done in the evening. Looking forward to my call with the lads in the evening😁
18/10/2020, 14:33 - Bee: Oh the call! It's been a while hasn't it
18/10/2020, 14:33 - Bee: I'm getting my daily walk in

18/10/2020, 15:01 - Bee: 😇
18/10/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Tried garlic today
18/10/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: I guess this counts as the next week
18/10/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Yes
18/10/2020, 15:02 - Bee: I've had my share for this week
18/10/2020, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: Sure sure. It's not like you'll be having shawarma at all this week now
18/10/2020, 16:44 - Bee: I won't nana
18/10/2020, 16:45 - Bee: I'm sick of shawarma now. At least until the end of this month
18/10/2020, 16:45 - Bee: What're you doing?
18/10/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: Coding. What about you?
18/10/2020, 17:10 - Bee: CSS?
18/10/2020, 17:11 - Bee: Nothing really. Listening to my family talk
18/10/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: That's part of it. The joke generator still. Finishing it up today in whatever form it ends up
18/10/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Oh. Did you use any of the fancy buttons?
18/10/2020, 17:18 - Bee: I'm exhausted. I need to go to bed early
18/10/2020, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Done preparing for tomorrow?
18/10/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Nope.
18/10/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Are you doing that now?
18/10/2020, 17:24 - Bee: No. I'll take a bath and go to sleep. Can't keep my eyes open. I'll prepare tomorrow evening

18/10/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Listening to this rn
18/10/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: You can take your time listening to it 😅
18/10/2020, 17:50 - Bee: I did
18/10/2020, 17:51 - Bee: It's a lovely song
18/10/2020, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: Going to sleep now?

18/10/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Hi
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Bee: It was Mai
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: I thought as much 😂
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Bee: And Ruth wasn't there to be the buffer
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: I'll ask you next time why
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Bee: I will tell you why
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Nischal Abraham: About the laugh thing
18/10/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Goodnight nana :)

19/10/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: For what?
19/10/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: There was no Hannah yesterday. She'd gone to sleep :(. But it was so fun chatting with everyone again. We went on for 3 hours 😂
19/10/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and it's my parent's 32nd wedding anniversary today! I'm sure they'll be delighted to have a wish from you, if you want to. Entirely optional
19/10/2020, 11:14 - Bee: The first night of garba for Navratri
19/10/2020, 11:16 - Bee: Aw :(. I guessed so. Your last seen on WhatsApp was my 3:30am. Must have been a lovely time no? Looking forward to hearing about it!
19/10/2020, 11:16 - Bee: Oh!!!! I want to wish them. Thank you for letting me know :)
19/10/2020, 11:17 - Bee: I'm going to stalk them on Facebook for a photo now
19/10/2020, 11:18 - Bee: Do you have a photo from their wedding? Maybe not. But asking in case you do
19/10/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: AH! I didn't realise the gif was literal 😂
19/10/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: From their wedding I'll have to scour my hard drive. But the chances are slim
19/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 11:19 - Bee: Its okay I'll look through Facebook
19/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's them yesterday at Ranjit uncles place
19/10/2020, 11:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'll send you more photos in some time. Have a meeting with PBS folks in 10 min
19/10/2020, 11:20 - Bee: No problem
19/10/2020, 11:20 - Bee: Thanks nana
19/10/2020, 11:44 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: Debby... you make us kids look bad
19/10/2020, 14:04 - Bee: Should I make one for you too?
19/10/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: No no 😂. It was a compliment to you. I'll be calling later with Nikhil when he's off work
19/10/2020, 14:04 - Bee: After sending a few messages back and forth, uncle sent a heart
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Bee: And I sent this
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Bee: I'm proud of myself.
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: Aww
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Bee: 😂
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: Rightly so. Have you reached home yet?
19/10/2020, 14:05 - Bee: Uncle hasn't replied yet. 🙈
19/10/2020, 14:06 - Bee: I have. My train timings have changed 😫
19/10/2020, 14:06 - Bee: 4:30 train is now a 4:49 train
19/10/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: Is that too bad? Does it come on time?
19/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: It comes on time. College gets over at 4. There's nothing to do from 4 until the train arrives
19/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Cool. Y'all should take a screenshot again for a new profile photo
19/10/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Listen to more podcasts. Read a book?
19/10/2020, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: Nidhi might be busy with group discussions so it'll just be 4
19/10/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Yeah I can try that. My morning train timings have been changed to. At 8:03 (A Panvel train, so I'll have to change at Juinagar) instead of 8:30
19/10/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Too*
19/10/2020, 14:26 - Bee: I'm going to make a funny video for Reenee. No reason.
19/10/2020, 14:26 - Bee: Sudden motivation. Don't know from where.
19/10/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: At least it's changed to times you can still take them. It'd be worse if they overlapped with college time
19/10/2020, 14:36 - Nischal Abraham: Let your creativity flow Bee 😊
19/10/2020, 14:57 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/IwwsIrPxqqI
19/10/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 15:52 - Bee: True true. I'm still grumbling about the waiting.
19/10/2020, 15:53 - Bee: Oh it was just the three of y'all?
19/10/2020, 15:54 - Bee: Done recording. Now I'll edit. But the thing with these videos is that the finished product isn't long at all. But too many takes and cuts
19/10/2020, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's 5 of us Debby... Are you wearing your glasses?
19/10/2020, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Video editing ends up being that way. I've heard for 10min of quality video it can take anywhere from 1hour to 10 hours of recording and editing
19/10/2020, 16:36 - Bee: I meant 3 screens nana
19/10/2020, 16:36 - Bee: 3 families. Or 2 families and a single man. So 3
19/10/2020, 16:37 - Bee: The key word being 'quality'
19/10/2020, 16:37 - Bee: What's up?
19/10/2020, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Could we talk tonight?
19/10/2020, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: Just ended my call with parents
19/10/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Yep. In 5 if that's okay?
19/10/2020, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: 5 more?
19/10/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Sure
19/10/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
19/10/2020, 18:00 - Bee: Give me 1 min
19/10/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
19/10/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Hi
19/10/2020, 18:02 - Bee: Missed voice call
19/10/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. Nidhi still has her group submission thing
19/10/2020, 18:36 - Bee: It's so late! Must be a lot of work then
19/10/2020, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Due tomorrow. She sounds so down but she was in video call with her group so we cut the call short
19/10/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Submissions are stressful. Hopefully she's okay once it's done
19/10/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I hope so too
19/10/2020, 18:40 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to bed?
19/10/2020, 18:41 - Bee: I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you. 
Psalm 32:8
19/10/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Yes
19/10/2020, 18:41 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: He definitely will ☺️
19/10/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Haw that's fake. Who took the photo 😂
19/10/2020, 18:42 - Bee: I took it myself. Never said it's a candid. 😒 Couldn't keep my eyes open because of the flash
19/10/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: Anyway sleep well Bee! Praying you have a lovely night and a lovelier day tomorrow
19/10/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Do you want a more realistic photo
19/10/2020, 18:43 - Nischal Abraham: I want to be with you
19/10/2020, 18:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>
19/10/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Nothing else I want more. All in His time. :)
19/10/2020, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: Indeed. Just letting you know you are beloved ☺️
19/10/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Thank you, nana. It's an honour being loved by you. Can never thank God enough.
19/10/2020, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
19/10/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Have I left you speechless
19/10/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I guess not
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: I hope the rest of your day goes well.
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: You did. But I also don't want you to end up staying up just messaging me
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Praying.
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Okay I will continue tomorrow
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Bye. :)
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: 🥰
19/10/2020, 18:47 - Nischal Abraham: Bye 😊😊
20/10/2020, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! Praying you have a lovely day 😊
20/10/2020, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/ysEN5RaKOlA

You don't need to watch it. But if you want to know what I do this video explains it better than I ever could
20/10/2020, 13:24 - Bee: Hey, bb
20/10/2020, 13:25 - Bee: Just reached home. Busy day today
20/10/2020, 13:25 - Bee: I had an okay day. How's your day going?
20/10/2020, 13:26 - Bee: I want to know what you do. I will watch it
20/10/2020, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: Not busy but I feel stressed 😅. Still no clarity on decisions to be made
20/10/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Have you been given a deadline to make the decision?
20/10/2020, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: In a sense. I should start by Nov 2nd so that Maggie can show me the basics on things that need to be done before she can't anymore
20/10/2020, 16:10 - Bee: Oh. You'll have to give your answer well before then. If God gives a thumbs up, where in Ireland will you have to move to?
20/10/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: They stay in County Cavan. It's very close to where Timon stays. Proper countryside
20/10/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Brb. Making bookmarks
20/10/2020, 17:23 - Bee: There's a thing at Bethany for covid housekeeping staff. I've been told to make bookmarks with verses in Hindi
20/10/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... What do you mean by a thing?
20/10/2020, 18:54 - Bee: I was mistaken. It's for the housekeeping staff that had tested covid positive but have now recovered
20/10/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! How many did you make?
20/10/2020, 18:55 - Bee: I don't know nana
20/10/2020, 18:55 - Bee: A tiny gospel event
20/10/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Made 15
20/10/2020, 18:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: You're up late tonight... Cause of the bookmarks?
20/10/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Yes nana
20/10/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: 😂 Uncle's face in that pic is epic
20/10/2020, 18:56 - Bee: Heading to bed now
20/10/2020, 18:56 - Bee: 😂 he was forced to pose.
20/10/2020, 18:57 - Bee: He did all the cutting work
20/10/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: And they look lovely Debby! Beautiful 😊
20/10/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Thank you, nana. ☺️
20/10/2020, 18:57 - Bee: It was a family effort
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Ashley looked up the verses in Hindi
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Papa cut everything
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: And stuck everything
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: What's up?
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: How are you?
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: What are your thinking about?
20/10/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Are you eating okay?
20/10/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like the family projects we take up for Nidhi
20/10/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: Thinking and praying and talking. Been on a bunch of calls today. Will be calling Cherian in sometime as well
20/10/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Do you want to get on a call?
20/10/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'm well. Though I do have a slight headache and I don't think it's dehydration cause I've been drinking loads of water all day
20/10/2020, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Only 1 major thing on my mind at the moment 😅. I thought I'd spend some time studying Lamentations for a bit but couldn't get around to it
20/10/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Made pasta today... The kitchen made me wonder how many ingredients and utensils I'd leave behind if I moved
20/10/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: If you want to sleep we can talk another day. It's late for you nana
20/10/2020, 19:04 - Bee: And I'm tired :(
20/10/2020, 19:04 - Bee: Too much thinking?
20/10/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Go to sleep :). There'll be many days for talking. I think today is not meant to be one of them
20/10/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Will you have enough utensils for yourself?
20/10/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe. I don't want to be stressing on something... But it feels slightly involuntary. I'm glad for it though, it's pushing me to do something instead of wasting my time
20/10/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... There'll always be enough. The small things don't even matter Debby. Even if I were to move empty handed... If it was in the will of the Lord I'm sure it'd be fine
20/10/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Dude!!!!! This was exactly what I was thinking when I read that message. But then I was like, "Debby, be practical".
20/10/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Yes. And it'll be good whenever it is.
20/10/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... I like practical thinking 😁. But practical thinking is what I do in my own strength... and this is beyond me
20/10/2020, 19:09 - Bee: I'm praying, nana. God doesn't tease us. He answers. Don't know when but He does.
20/10/2020, 19:10 - Bee: You don't have to say anything
20/10/2020, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Amen. I thank God for His answer in you
20/10/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Stephen uncle shared during prayer meeting today. And he started with the statement "God always answers". That was a not so gentle but much needed reminder for me
20/10/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'll go and call Cherian now. Enjoy your night Bee! Praying your day tomorrow is a good one too 😊
20/10/2020, 19:11 - Bee: You too. :)
20/10/2020, 19:11 - Bee: Goodnight!
20/10/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
20/10/2020, 19:12 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: 💜
21/10/2020, 08:26 - Bee: Good morning, bb. :)
21/10/2020, 08:27 - Bee: Praying for you and your day and for peace and clarity. :)
21/10/2020, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! How's your day been?
21/10/2020, 13:44 - Bee: It's evening for me
21/10/2020, 13:43 - Bee: Missed voice call
21/10/2020, 13:46 - Bee: My day is going okay. Back home. Raining heavily. I had some sweet potato
21/10/2020, 13:47 - Bee: What are you doing?
21/10/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sitting in my room. How did I miss your call!? My phone was right next to me 😶
21/10/2020, 13:48 - Bee: It showed Calling. Not ringing. I assumed your internet must be off
21/10/2020, 13:48 - Bee: I simply called
21/10/2020, 13:48 - Bee: Are you free for a call?
21/10/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: The usernames are hilarious 😂
21/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Which one's yours?
21/10/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Guess
21/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Do you remember how I told you that I won't take an evening nap because then I won't feel sleepy at night
21/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: garNish
21/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Nice one ya
21/10/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Like wow. Much wow
21/10/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Did you end up taking a nap?
21/10/2020, 18:15 - Bee: Yep.
21/10/2020, 18:15 - Bee: 🤦🏽‍♀️
21/10/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Are you not sleepy anymore?
21/10/2020, 18:15 - Bee: But I'm still sleepy. Joke's on the evening nap
21/10/2020, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Then it's fine. If you can fall asleep that's good 😊
21/10/2020, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: It was Milosz's idea 😂. They were on an Uncle Roger hype
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Have you had your call with Gareth?
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Milosz is a name or username?
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep done a while back
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Yes I got the theme. Rufus and his friends are cool
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Can I call you in 15 then?
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Name. He's the pink one
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Sure!
21/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'll go take a shower in the meantime
21/10/2020, 18:18 - Bee: What's SuprEma referring to?
21/10/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Take your time. Put on some music. Light some candles.
21/10/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: Nothing 😂. Her name's Ema
21/10/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Maybe not candles. But music
21/10/2020, 18:18 - Nischal Abraham: She didn't join into the joke
21/10/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
21/10/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: If I take my time then it will take longer than 15 min
21/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: I can wait nana
21/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Don't rush
21/10/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Okay bro... I'll brb
21/10/2020, 18:19 - Bee: Okay dude
21/10/2020, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
21/10/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Hi
21/10/2020, 18:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
22/10/2020, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope you slept well
22/10/2020, 11:56 - Bee: I did. What about you?
22/10/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Slept alright. Took a while to fall asleep though
22/10/2020, 13:26 - Bee: How come? You weren't sleepy? Or were lost in thought?
22/10/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: Lost in thought. But I've decided to go help PBS out. Already sent a mail to Gareth and spoke to my landlord
22/10/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Oh. So there's God's perfect peace.
22/10/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Also anxiety maybe?
22/10/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Not anxious anymore. Not a doubt in my mind I made the right call. Was a bit anxious about talking to the landlord but he was super super chill about it
22/10/2020, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: Which I guess is expected since God's taking care of ALL the small things. And these are just the ones that I know of
22/10/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Hi bb
22/10/2020, 16:35 - Bee: It is expected!! I'm always surprised when things work out like that. I never expect it. But I should. We should! Because God takes care of everything
22/10/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Also, I realized that ok going to have to change the address on the letter I'd written before I post it 😁
22/10/2020, 16:36 - Bee: I'm*
22/10/2020, 16:36 - Bee: If it's okay for you to receive letters there. And if posts from India to Ireland are accepted.
22/10/2020, 16:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'll collect letters coming to this address for a while. Cause most of my documents are linked to this address
22/10/2020, 16:54 - Bee: Ahh. I'll have to wait until the end of the month to go to the post office. It closes at 12:30
22/10/2020, 17:10 - Nischal Abraham: Has post opened for Ireland... Did I tell you we went into a level 5 lockdown?
22/10/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I'm guessing not then.
22/10/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Another month?!?!
22/10/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Maybe you'll have to wait until March then
22/10/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: I don't mind waiting
22/10/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to bed early tonight?
22/10/2020, 17:16 - Bee: I think I will
22/10/2020, 17:16 - Bee: What are you doing?
22/10/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Can I call for a few minutes?
22/10/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
22/10/2020, 18:03 - Bee: There was no Krack-jack. What I thought was Krack-jack was a coconut-y biscuit which I'm not fond of. I had Chocos instead
22/10/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Just an update
22/10/2020, 18:03 - Bee: And now I go to sleep
22/10/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Bye. :)
22/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Chocos sounds nice
22/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep sounds even better 😌
22/10/2020, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Byee!
23/10/2020, 09:49 - Bee: There's an uncle who sends good morning forwards to me everyday
23/10/2020, 09:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
23/10/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Where's one for you.
23/10/2020, 09:49 - Bee: 😂
23/10/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Have a good day!
23/10/2020, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee! I hope you have a good day too 😊
23/10/2020, 10:30 - Bee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drcvuQI8Mm0
23/10/2020, 10:58 - Bee: This message was deleted
23/10/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
23/10/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: That was brutal... But also very hilarious
23/10/2020, 14:51 - Bee: Poor Barry.
23/10/2020, 14:51 - Bee: He the one who's made fun of the most
23/10/2020, 14:51 - Bee: Hilarious yessss
23/10/2020, 14:51 - Bee: What's up?
23/10/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Just got done with lunch... Are you home already?
23/10/2020, 14:53 - Bee: Yes
23/10/2020, 14:53 - Bee: Already?
23/10/2020, 14:53 - Bee: I'm late today
23/10/2020, 14:53 - Bee: I missed my train and came via Kurla. And had to wait for the bus for a while
23/10/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no. That sounds tiring
23/10/2020, 14:57 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't realise the time. Looks like I took longer to prepare lunch than I thought I did 😂
23/10/2020, 15:00 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
23/10/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
23/10/2020, 15:07 - Bee: Looks like a pretty good lunch 😁 no wonder you took longer
23/10/2020, 15:07 - Bee: Red leaf for me please! Gentle reminder.
23/10/2020, 15:07 - Bee: May turn to a not-so-gentle reminder
23/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: 😇
23/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Jk.
23/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Lovely view
23/10/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: What's a not-so-gentle reminder?
23/10/2020, 15:17 - Bee: We will cross the bridge when it comes
23/10/2020, 15:17 - Bee: _If_ it comes
23/10/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay... I look forward to it 😁
23/10/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Which means you won't have a leaf?
23/10/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Save*
23/10/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: No no I meant I'll look forward to the bridge when we cross it... What're you upto?
23/10/2020, 16:06 - Bee: <Media omitted>
23/10/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes Friday meeting! Have fun!!
23/10/2020, 16:56 - Bee: Would you like to guess what I'm having for dinner?
23/10/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Rice, Dal and fish?
23/10/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Nope
23/10/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Chapatti and the curry you don't like?
23/10/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: Biscuits?
23/10/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: Aloo bhujiya?

23/10/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: I feel like all it's missing is a caption in bold white text
23/10/2020, 17:01 - Bee: My face is a meme 😂
23/10/2020, 17:01 - Bee: You can add text

23/10/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Or

23/10/2020, 17:02 - Bee: You give me a caption and I'll add it meme style
23/10/2020, 17:02 - Bee: He is

23/10/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Ben is good
23/10/2020, 17:03 - Bee: When you find a boy who is like Indian food , hot spicy and brown

23/10/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: I don't get it

23/10/2020, 18:10 - Bee: People in church call others 'brother/sister' right
23/10/2020, 18:11 - Bee: But you wouldn't want your crush to call you that
23/10/2020, 18:11 - Bee: I'm off to bed nana
23/10/2020, 18:11 - Bee: Goodnight! :)

23/10/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Still wouldn't want him to call me sister no
23/10/2020, 18:12 - Bee: Would you want your crush to call you brother
23/10/2020, 18:12 - Nischal Abraham: But we're all brothers and sisters in Christ

23/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: No you must say "Maybe 'okay' will be our always"
23/10/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Is that from a movie?
23/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: That's an over-referenced line from The fault in our stars
23/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Yep
23/10/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Bye!
23/10/2020, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't seen it. But I like the line
23/10/2020, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Byee!
23/10/2020, 18:16 - Bee: Theres more to it
23/10/2020, 18:16 - Bee: I'll tell you when we talk next
23/10/2020, 18:16 - Bee: Bye :)
23/10/2020, 18:16 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds poetic. But I take it back. Why does okay have to be the always
23/10/2020, 18:17 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it 😊
23/10/2020, 18:17 - Bee: I will tell you tomorrow
24/10/2020, 10:04 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! Hope your day has been fun
24/10/2020, 10:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'm planning on checklisting today. Ask me later what checklists I've made
24/10/2020, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: (trying to force accountability 😂. Sorry for dumping the role on you)
24/10/2020, 11:47 - Bee: Hi bb
24/10/2020, 11:47 - Bee: Don't be sorry
24/10/2020, 11:47 - Bee: I'll force it in return

24/10/2020, 12:13 - Nischal Abraham: How's the college day going?
24/10/2020, 13:36 - Bee: College was busy today
24/10/2020, 13:36 - Bee: Good kinda busy
24/10/2020, 13:36 - Bee: How's your day go?
24/10/2020, 13:36 - Bee: I'm eating Aloo bhujia in my style
24/10/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been good so far. I made a list 😁
24/10/2020, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: That belly will end up being too round to hold a bowl
24/10/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. Are you home already or on your way?
24/10/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: Nvm... I'm dumb... Forgot you can't eat Aloo bhujia if you aren't home 😂😂
24/10/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: But you're home early then right!?
24/10/2020, 14:06 - Bee: That's good. What's it titled?
24/10/2020, 14:06 - Bee: Are these lists to help you pack up?
24/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I am home already
24/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Nope. What if I was eating it on my way back?
24/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: Yesss!!!!
24/10/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I'm going to make beef cutlets tonight
24/10/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
24/10/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Is that another late night or for dinner?
24/10/2020, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: If you were eating in your style on your way back then the train must be a lot emptier than I imagine it to be
24/10/2020, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: Pack
24/10/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Ehhhh. I'm sure I'll come up with a solution
24/10/2020, 14:14 - Bee: I'll keep the bowl beside me instead of on my belly
24/10/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Is this the only list you planned on making?
24/10/2020, 14:15 - Bee: It's for tomorrow. I'm hoping I finish before it's late but who knows
24/10/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Hahahahhahahahahahahahahahha
24/10/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Why can't I stop laughing
24/10/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Why are you so funny
24/10/2020, 14:16 - Bee: I'm imagining myself eating like that in the train
24/10/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Only you find me funny Bee. And that too it's not often. The only other person who finds me as funny is me 😁
24/10/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. The other one is called to do
24/10/2020, 14:16 - Bee: I find you funny often!!!! But often is relative
24/10/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Isn't that good tho? That you enjoy your humor and your company
24/10/2020, 14:20 - Nischal Abraham: Would you be free for a call today?
24/10/2020, 14:21 - Bee: I will
24/10/2020, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: Good for me. Maybe not so much for people who don't find me funny
24/10/2020, 14:37 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/SCvUDXKCtiA
24/10/2020, 15:10 - Bee: 😮
24/10/2020, 15:10 - Bee: How do you find these?!
24/10/2020, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Randomly... But her voice is so dreamy
24/10/2020, 15:12 - Bee: It is
24/10/2020, 15:12 - Bee: She should be a Disney Princess
24/10/2020, 15:12 - Bee: Or on Broadway
24/10/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yea! That's the same vibe I got
24/10/2020, 15:14 - Bee: Hearing you say vibe is unusual
24/10/2020, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: But you're not hearing it... you're reading what I typed
24/10/2020, 15:17 - Bee: I meant the same thing
24/10/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... I'll take unusual as a compliment then
24/10/2020, 15:27 - Bee: It is
24/10/2020, 15:27 - Bee: Today is my long shower day
24/10/2020, 15:27 - Bee: But I won't be washing my hair. I oiled my hair today and want it to remain for another day
24/10/2020, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely. Enjoy!
24/10/2020, 17:46 - Bee: Cutlets almost done machaaaaa
24/10/2020, 17:50 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice. How do they look?
24/10/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Hi bb

24/10/2020, 18:46 - Bee: No no don't be sorry

24/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: You take your time
24/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: :)
24/10/2020, 18:47 - Bee: Don't!! I didn't even tell you when I'd be free for a call

24/10/2020, 19:03 - Nischal Abraham: Are you on a call with Tijy?
24/10/2020, 19:05 - Bee: Yes I am
24/10/2020, 19:05 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough. I'll let them know
24/10/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Thanks man
24/10/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: I'm taking that as a you don't want to join in a round of Ludo btw
24/10/2020, 19:07 - Nischal Abraham: Hope that's alright
24/10/2020, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: By that I mean I hope I'm interpreting it right 😅
24/10/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Sammy kept pestering
24/10/2020, 19:10 - Bee: I asked him to give me 5 minutes
24/10/2020, 19:10 - Bee: Two minutes remaining
24/10/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Ohkay
24/10/2020, 19:13 - Bee: Is that okay?
24/10/2020, 19:13 - Bee: There may be no call tonight
24/10/2020, 19:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yea I know... That's okay. But it'll be fun playing together?
24/10/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Okay
24/10/2020, 19:14 - Bee: I think Sammy is sending the code
24/10/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: See if you had Discord we could've had a voice channel active in the background while the game was going on 😏
24/10/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Is there an app for that?!?!
24/10/2020, 19:15 - Bee: That sounds like fun
24/10/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yep there is

24/10/2020, 20:02 - Nischal Abraham: But hope it's good all the same ☺️
24/10/2020, 20:02 - Bee: Nothing other than worship
24/10/2020, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks nana 😊
25/10/2020, 06:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/10/2020, 06:02 - Bee: <Media omitted>
25/10/2020, 06:03 - Bee: I hope you have a nice time too. :)
25/10/2020, 07:43 - Bee: Btw, what's your blood group?
25/10/2020, 08:09 - Nischal Abraham: Who is that on the call?
25/10/2020, 08:11 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to worship. Do pray as I'll be sharing the morning for the message service

25/10/2020, 08:50 - Bee: Why can't it be 0 hours
25/10/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Ah... Your weekly call with kids
25/10/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Then neither of us would be free for a call. This works out right since you get mornings without me!
25/10/2020, 08:59 - Bee: I'll be busy sleeping during your nights and you'll be busy doing something or the other during my nights so essentially I get mornings, evenings, and nights without you
25/10/2020, 09:00 - Bee: Which I don't want
25/10/2020, 09:00 - Bee: I will grumble more about it after worship

26/10/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: The only right way to do it 😂
26/10/2020, 10:51 - Nischal Abraham: Why? Didn't you tell them you're already almost done?
26/10/2020, 10:52 - Bee: 😂
26/10/2020, 10:52 - Bee: I did
26/10/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: And they didn't like the idea of doing less work?
26/10/2020, 10:54 - Bee: I gave my groupmates an update about all of it. And a couple of them were supposed to come to college today. They didn't. Which angered our guide. So she told us to repeat it
26/10/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no 🙁. That sounds terrible
26/10/2020, 10:56 - Bee: It is what it is
26/10/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Are you okay?
26/10/2020, 11:13 - Bee: Yes I am
26/10/2020, 11:14 - Bee: As long as we finish before December 18th
26/10/2020, 11:17 - Nischal Abraham: Okayy... I hope you guys do!
26/10/2020, 11:18 - Bee: I hope so too
26/10/2020, 11:18 - Bee: What's up?
26/10/2020, 11:19 - Bee: How are you today?
26/10/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well. Had a call with Arpitha just catching up
26/10/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: Thinking of heading out for a walk now
26/10/2020, 12:22 - Bee: Oh wow. How is she doing?
26/10/2020, 12:22 - Bee: Back home?
26/10/2020, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: She's well. And I'm back home now
26/10/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Are you back home?
26/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Hi Nischal
26/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: I reached home around 6:15
26/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Immediately took a shower and went to visit Julie aunty
26/10/2020, 15:04 - Bee: Just got back home
26/10/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: How was your visit?
26/10/2020, 15:06 - Bee: Lovely. I've been given homework to do. Stuff about career and places to work at
26/10/2020, 15:06 - Bee: What's up?
26/10/2020, 15:06 - Bee: What are you doing?
26/10/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: Lazing around... do you have any plans?
26/10/2020, 15:07 - Bee: There's a call with Ruth at night
26/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: To pray and talk about the sisters meeting on Friday
26/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: No other plans
26/10/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: No shawarma today?
26/10/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Nah. Saturday probably 😋
26/10/2020, 15:09 - Bee: Because the offer is ending right.
26/10/2020, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yep yep. I took a new route for my walk and it was nice!

26/10/2020, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
26/10/2020, 15:22 - Bee: This looks similar to your cycling path
26/10/2020, 15:23 - Bee: It's a nice place to sit and read the Bible
26/10/2020, 15:23 - Bee: And underline with pretty colors
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: It's the other side of the cycling path... Towards Enfield instead of Maynooth
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Bee: Enfield is a new name
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Bee: How far did you go?
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Bee: How many kilometres?
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Bee: Did you have a snack?
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: There were horses on the opposite side of the canal at a point
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Bee: Noooo lunch maybe?
26/10/2020, 15:25 - Bee: No snack
26/10/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Oh. May not have been like our tiny Indian horses
26/10/2020, 15:26 - Bee: So exciting mannnnnn
26/10/2020, 15:28 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
26/10/2020, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: I had lunch after getting back home
26/10/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: When is your call with Ruth?
26/10/2020, 15:34 - Bee: I'm not sure yet. I will ask her
26/10/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Messaged her. I don't think she'll check anytime soon though
26/10/2020, 15:35 - Bee: What did you have?
26/10/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Store-bought chicken sandwiches
26/10/2020, 15:40 - Bee: I'm eating rice, chana curry, and cutlets
26/10/2020, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: Nice 😌
26/10/2020, 16:05 - Bee: Hi
26/10/2020, 16:05 - Bee: Can I call you?
26/10/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
26/10/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Still free?
26/10/2020, 16:23 - Bee: I am
26/10/2020, 17:11 - Bee: 🥰
26/10/2020, 17:12 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/10/2020, 17:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
26/10/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Bye
26/10/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
27/10/2020, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! Hope you're having a good day
27/10/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Hi
27/10/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
27/10/2020, 10:16 - Bee: I am having a good day
27/10/2020, 10:16 - Bee: No reason to call it a bad day. Yet
27/10/2020, 10:16 - Bee: Right back at ya bb
27/10/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's a lot of bees
27/10/2020, 10:20 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! It isn't sunny for me today so I probably won't go out for a walk
27/10/2020, 10:33 - Bee: What else are you going to do today?
27/10/2020, 10:33 - Bee: When is Patrick heading up?
27/10/2020, 10:33 - Bee: Aren't you sending some stuff with him?
27/10/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yep he'll be coming on Thursday or Friday. Packing is one of the things I need to do today
27/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: What else are you gotto do today?
27/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: I might eat a Frankie on my way home
27/10/2020, 11:45 - Bee: I am excited
27/10/2020, 11:46 - Bee: It's my first Frankie in months
27/10/2020, 11:46 - Bee: Going to* 🤦🏽‍♀️
27/10/2020, 11:46 - Bee: How are you feeling?
27/10/2020, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh... Frankie sounds nice. Alone?
27/10/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Work on moodle. Hopefully play some guitar
27/10/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: Very unmotivated to do anything
27/10/2020, 11:56 - Bee: No. A second year student is there with me. She lives in Dharamveer Nagar. We've been traveling together all this while. It's been nice having company
27/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: For a new challenge?
27/10/2020, 11:57 - Bee: Moodle
27/10/2020, 11:58 - Bee: Wonderwall?
27/10/2020, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: No that's to help out with PBS
27/10/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Na. Just for the sake of playing. Don't feel like learning something new today
27/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: Okay
27/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: That's good.
27/10/2020, 12:21 - Bee: Do you have a favourite scent?
27/10/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Scent as in perfume? Or anything? I like the smell of good hot food 😋
27/10/2020, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Not too big on scent of flowers though
27/10/2020, 12:25 - Nischal Abraham: If it's in perfumes the best one I've liked so far is called "Cool Water" by Davidoff
27/10/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: Ranjit uncle had gifted that one. Have I told you I've never bought myself a perfume bottle? It's all been gifted so I've never gone looking for a good one
27/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: Both
27/10/2020, 12:26 - Bee: So I should not bring you flowers?
27/10/2020, 12:26 - Nischal Abraham: I just get used to the ones I have. Albeit I don't use perfumes very often. I prefer just taking showers when I can... Much more refreshing
27/10/2020, 12:27 - Bee: Ahhh that sounds familiar. Maybe an ad. Or Ashley might have one? I don't know
27/10/2020, 12:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'd appreciate the sentiment... But I'd rather a guitar pick 😂
27/10/2020, 12:27 - Bee: Same!!!!! I've never bought myself perfumes. But I'm not big on perfumes. Mostly because I'm always in a hurry and don't want to spend time spraying perfume on
27/10/2020, 12:28 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't the whole point of perfumes for people who are in a hurry?
27/10/2020, 12:28 - Bee: Noted. Don't they come in various thicknesses? Give me more deets
27/10/2020, 12:28 - Bee: I'm on level 1000 hurry
27/10/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: I don't mean literally guitar picks... Its more like I'd rather have something I can use. Have you not noticed I'm not much of a house decorator? 😂
27/10/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Like a Frankie roll sounds mouth watering 🤤
27/10/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: If you spent more time getting ready you could make it a x100 hurry and use perfumes
27/10/2020, 12:37 - Bee: You're not much of a house decorator? I would've never guessed that
27/10/2020, 12:37 - Bee: And here I thought you were going to make gift-giving easy
27/10/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Dude it was yum. Chicken noodle Frankie. Like yummmmm
27/10/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you're already done having it... It does sounds yum
27/10/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
27/10/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: You see what's at the bottom of the list there?
27/10/2020, 12:41 - Bee: Yes yes. I want to give you gifts anyway. Definitely not as much as I want to spend quality time with you. But no gifts? Impossible
27/10/2020, 12:44 - Bee: I like the scent of coconuts, salty sea breezes, babies, wet soil after rain, fresh laundry, food (even more so when I'm hungry), some flowery stuff, body washes and scrubs
27/10/2020, 12:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'll love receiving gifts especially coming from you regardless of what the numbers say 😊
27/10/2020, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like poetry. You should be a writer Debby
27/10/2020, 12:47 - Bee: Except for flowers
27/10/2020, 12:49 - Bee: I should write one titled 'these are a few of my favourite scents' and sing it to the tune of 'these are a few of my favourite things'
27/10/2020, 12:49 - Bee: But what 😂
27/10/2020, 12:49 - Bee: What men
27/10/2020, 12:52 - Bee: Papa and I taking Mai out for a drive. Brb
27/10/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Clever. If there's anyone who can write a bit song it should be you
27/10/2020, 12:52 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun!
27/10/2020, 13:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
27/10/2020, 13:32 - Bee: Brb
27/10/2020, 15:11 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!!!!!
27/10/2020, 15:11 - Bee: It'll be years in the making
27/10/2020, 15:11 - Bee: What's up?
27/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Are you an applet? You make me feel all GUI (gooey) inside
27/10/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: Do you understand that one?
27/10/2020, 15:37 - Bee: I googled what an applet and GUI is so I think I know those things individually yes
27/10/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: Just got back from a short walk. How was the drive?
27/10/2020, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: 😮. Yep then I guess you do understand
27/10/2020, 15:38 - Bee: It was alright. Had some bhel. Yum.
27/10/2020, 15:38 - Bee: I don't know what they mean in the same sentence tho.
27/10/2020, 15:39 - Bee: I should stick to medical and generic lines
27/10/2020, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
27/10/2020, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: I get the joke so I can still respond. Awww 😌
27/10/2020, 16:22 - Bee: I thought you didn't get it. Or didn't like it
27/10/2020, 16:22 - Bee: You didn't say anything!! What men
27/10/2020, 16:22 - Bee: You have to explain it to me
27/10/2020, 16:22 - Bee: I had Dal, rice, and chana
27/10/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: The important part is that I make you feel gooey inside... Which I hope is a good feeling otherwise I'm just making you feel like weird mush
27/10/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: Would you be up for a call tonight?
27/10/2020, 16:49 - Bee: It is the good kinda gooey. :))
27/10/2020, 16:49 - Bee: I am. Is 10:45 okay?
27/10/2020, 16:50 - Bee: Will you be free then?
27/10/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
27/10/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Hi
27/10/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Give me 1 min pls
27/10/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: https://goo.gl/maps/h5BR552Wk6dKSYVa6

27/10/2020, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: Felt cute. Might delete later
27/10/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: I've seen this on insta posts as a quote... Never really understood it. You can explain if you do
27/10/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Also that's my first take. I'd have done a better one but Jibu came back home and I think Achu is sleeping so I'll leave recording for now
28/10/2020, 05:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2020, 05:47 - Bee: Hahahahaha. So cute ya Nischal.
28/10/2020, 05:47 - Bee: I will when we talk. * harflip *
28/10/2020, 05:47 - Bee: Arrrgghh.
28/10/2020, 05:47 - Bee: HAIRFLIPPPPPP
28/10/2020, 05:48 - Bee: It sounds like your 10th take (because it is sooooooooooooooooooooo good). Not that you'd need 10 takes.
28/10/2020, 05:49 - Bee: Nischal, thank you. ♥️
28/10/2020, 05:50 - Bee: I was listening to it on repeat on my way to college
28/10/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: That put a big smile on my face 😊. Made my morning!
28/10/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: I'd need way more with raw acoustic recordings of a song I haven't practiced before 😂
28/10/2020, 09:27 - Nischal Abraham: Aww... I'm glad you enjoyed it ☺️
28/10/2020, 10:31 - Bee: I'm glad ☺️
28/10/2020, 10:31 - Bee: How come this song?
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Bee: I did!!!!!!
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Bee: Are you a front end developer or a back end developer?
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Bee: I watched the video
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: I have a Spotify playlist for songs to cover. This was third on the list
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Bee: They mentioned GitHub!!!!!!
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Bee: And open source
28/10/2020, 10:32 - Bee: Oh. What's next?
28/10/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'd consider myself full stack = both
28/10/2020, 10:36 - Nischal Abraham: She does cover 90% of web development. And it's easy to understand too!
28/10/2020, 10:45 - Bee: Noted
28/10/2020, 10:46 - Bee: It is. Their comparison of a front end with the seating space in a restaurant and the back end with the cooking space was similar to my living room and bedroom analogy.
28/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: I have a question which is silly and embarrassing. For me, not for you. Buuuut I'm sure it doesn't hold a candle to the million embarrassing things I'm going to do in the future. I assumed you recorded the song for me. Was the assumption wrong?
28/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: You don't have to answer. You can ignore it and I won't mind
28/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: I'm meeting Shalini on Saturday 😁
28/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Here in Vashi.
28/10/2020, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I'll brb. Working on something with PBS
28/10/2020, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: And I'm back
28/10/2020, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: That's cool! Wasn't Saturday shawarma day?
28/10/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: I did record it for you. I was just playing it for myself but until a time when I can play it for you in person you'll have to bear with bad recordings 😂
28/10/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: What could be more embarrassing than that!?
28/10/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. The concept will always be the same
28/10/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Runaway by Jess Ray
28/10/2020, 12:54 - Bee: It is. Shalini postponed it to Sunday evening. She's missing Thane so she'll come here
28/10/2020, 12:56 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal. :)
28/10/2020, 12:56 - Bee: They're not bad recordings.
28/10/2020, 12:56 - Bee: Oh you wait. 😂 You're underestimating me
28/10/2020, 12:56 - Nischal Abraham: Have you heard the recordings with Achu?
28/10/2020, 12:57 - Bee: This is a lovely song. One of my favourites. Its there in the For a friend playlist
28/10/2020, 12:57 - Bee: I have
28/10/2020, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Have I already sent them to you... I didn't realise
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Sent what?
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: Achu had sent those
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: I know. I think you're the one who introduced me to it
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that makes sense
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Recordings with Achu
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: You did? I don't remember
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Well there's only 2 or 3 main songs we recorded
28/10/2020, 12:58 - Bee: I read it as I have. My bad
28/10/2020, 12:59 - Nischal Abraham: No no I guess I didn't. But you said Achu has
28/10/2020, 12:59 - Bee: Do you have those? Will you send them if you still have those?
28/10/2020, 12:59 - Bee: Yep
28/10/2020, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Sure. I do have them. Just need to search for the non-blooper recording
28/10/2020, 13:02 - Bee: No hurry
28/10/2020, 13:03 - Bee: Are you free for a call?
28/10/2020, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
28/10/2020, 14:37 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/10/2020, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: We're all so tinyyy!!!
28/10/2020, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: Except for Reenee... She so tall 😮
28/10/2020, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: Though I have to agree that is a bit odd for a wedding
28/10/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Taller than Josh!
28/10/2020, 15:44 - Bee: I think this was during the time when Irene was changing into a saree
28/10/2020, 15:44 - Bee: Makes sense. A good way to entertain the guests
28/10/2020, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: I don't remember this at all

29/10/2020, 10:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well the plate has featured in my initial dish photos. But they're all from home so makes sense

29/10/2020, 10:45 - Bee: How much is done?
29/10/2020, 10:46 - Bee: Send a photo no

29/10/2020, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: Phone cover box has my phone papers in it
29/10/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: Eh... My dad would've fit twice that into that suitcase 😂
29/10/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Oh. Is that where the photos are?
29/10/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Why do you need your phone papers?
29/10/2020, 10:54 - Bee: He's got years of experience dude
29/10/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Also, reply only when you have the time okay. You dont have to when you're in the flow of work

29/10/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yep

29/10/2020, 11:19 - Nischal Abraham: It's one second of my name scrolling across the screen 😂
29/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: Ahh. Since you don't have safety pins lying around
29/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: I like the sound of _our wall_. ☺️
29/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: I missed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😔
29/10/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: It's alright. I'll give you the timestamp after the livestream is done
29/10/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: Will probably take a screenshot and share it with my family anyway so I'll send it to you too
29/10/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Yes please
29/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: No I will take my own screenshot thanks.
29/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: You can send me yours too no problem

29/10/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Hi Niskal
29/10/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Idk... Coincidence?
29/10/2020, 12:49 - Bee: Okay

29/10/2020, 17:04 - Bee: Better luck tomorrow
29/10/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: I do need a beard trim so that's fair
29/10/2020, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: But I'll tell you that you look pretty. And if I could physically blush I would've every time I looked to see you
29/10/2020, 17:08 - Bee: I was joking nana
29/10/2020, 17:08 - Bee: You look handsome everyday. Why else do I take screenshots
29/10/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: I know nana. I chuckled
29/10/2020, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: To look at yourself obviously 😁
29/10/2020, 17:09 - Bee: We'll have to do something about that... Norah can get you some blush. Referencing a previous conversation if you remember
29/10/2020, 17:10 - Bee: I wish I could hear it nana. I like the sound of your chuckle
29/10/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Ehhhhhh sure sure

29/10/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: How's the prep?
29/10/2020, 17:11 - Bee: She'll run out of blush
29/10/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: I meant your statement not the fact that I chuckle
29/10/2020, 17:11 - Bee: College prep done. Messages Ruth. Waiting for her to reply
29/10/2020, 17:11 - Bee: Messaged*
29/10/2020, 17:12 - Bee: You want blush for when you chuckle?
29/10/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: I just said the opposite
29/10/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Did you?
29/10/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'm saying it now
29/10/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Noted

30/10/2020, 05:40 - Bee: Praying that the rest of your packing goes well. That you don't panic (can't remember a milder word for this. If you do, kindly insert it here). That you have a safe and fun journey.
30/10/2020, 08:05 - Nischal Abraham: Your prayers are beautiful 😌. I'm much more at peace today. Though my room is still a mess.

30/10/2020, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: You know what's worse than packing? Unpacking 😐
31/10/2020, 06:43 - Bee: This dresser is aesthetic. I like it. And serves as a bedside table. Yay!
31/10/2020, 06:44 - Bee: I SEE A WOODEN CHOPPING BOARD
31/10/2020, 06:46 - Bee: Is this this common kitchen area?
31/10/2020, 06:46 - Bee: Is this upstairs? (Where your room is)
31/10/2020, 06:47 - Bee: Where is this? 🤔
31/10/2020, 06:47 - Bee: This is were you'll be working right

31/10/2020, 06:50 - Bee: Looks so cozy
31/10/2020, 06:51 - Bee: 👏🏽🤝🏽 I love it. Take good care of it. Even if it might be an artificial one.
31/10/2020, 06:52 - Bee: This room is complete now. Except for the photos on the wall. But I will leave that for later. No more mentioning photos from my side cool?
31/10/2020, 06:52 - Bee: Also, what's inside the basket thingy?
31/10/2020, 06:53 - Bee: You have blinds now!!!!

31/10/2020, 06:55 - Bee: Just saw that the messages were getting delivered!!! And then they were not. I'm sorry if I woke you up...
31/10/2020, 06:57 - Bee: But now that messages aren't getting delivered I can keep sending them right?
31/10/2020, 06:57 - Bee: I'm excited for you, Nischal.
31/10/2020, 06:58 - Bee: Excited that I get to see you experience life and God and be there with you through it.
31/10/2020, 06:58 - Bee: Excited for me too because 👆🏽
31/10/2020, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: Yep! I've never had a dresser before. It's so much better than the shelf in my cupboard used to be 😮
31/10/2020, 08:05 - Nischal Abraham: You have better eyes than mine. I only noticed it when I made dinner
31/10/2020, 08:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2020, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: It's on the same floor but it's the same room as the kitchen. So common kitchen and sitting area
31/10/2020, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: Ground floor entrance. It was a random shot. I may have to actually make a video if you want to understand the layout better 😂
31/10/2020, 08:07 - Nischal Abraham: It's the common office so probably yea
31/10/2020, 08:08 - Nischal Abraham: Katherine who used to stay here bought a ton of stuff for the house. Also I'm pretty sure if it was a guy who used to stay here there'd be no mirror
31/10/2020, 08:08 - Nischal Abraham: One more is lying in the cupboard. 2 takes up enough space on a single bed as it is
31/10/2020, 08:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'll do my best
31/10/2020, 08:09 - Nischal Abraham: I like that 😊. Just remind yourself that it's photos for _our_ wall
31/10/2020, 08:10 - Nischal Abraham: Has a note inside with the WiFi password. And new ear plugs for sleeping I guess? I've never used ear plugs
31/10/2020, 08:10 - Nischal Abraham: I do!!
31/10/2020, 08:10 - Nischal Abraham: There are lovelier places too. And this morning was just rains so no sun
31/10/2020, 08:11 - Nischal Abraham: It was my fault for leaving my WiFi on 😂. I was so exhausted at night I just crashed after dinner and changing
31/10/2020, 08:13 - Nischal Abraham: I have free access to the whole building while it's not in use. That's sooo much space that I don't know what to do with 😂. I can finally enjoy a proper study table though that'll be nice
31/10/2020, 08:14 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you're having a lovely last day Bee! Have prayed and been praying you have a fun one 😊
31/10/2020, 09:24 - Bee: Have you unpacked your clothes? Or anything else? What about groceries?
31/10/2020, 09:25 - Bee: So I don't need glasses right?
31/10/2020, 09:25 - Bee: So kitchen, sitting area, your room on the same floor
The office downstairs
Correct?
31/10/2020, 09:25 - Bee: Yes please!!!
31/10/2020, 09:27 - Bee: Yeah. And you'll need only one
31/10/2020, 09:27 - Bee: They've carefully thought this through 😁
31/10/2020, 09:28 - Bee: I haven't either. Was it noisy last night? Is your window by the street? I think a video will answer allll my questions
31/10/2020, 09:28 - Bee: Or a video call!!!
31/10/2020, 09:29 - Bee: There's one in your room? Which own are you talking about? The office one?
31/10/2020, 09:29 - Bee: I am having a lovely last day :)
31/10/2020, 09:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yes! Let me know when you're free for one. My morning has been just me. I'll probably be having dinner with Gareth which I'm not sure what time I'll leave for
31/10/2020, 09:45 - Nischal Abraham: Everything unpacked. I need to buy groceries as there is no food at all in the house. But there's a storm outside today... I'll need to time a dry spell for a walk to the shop and back
31/10/2020, 09:45 - Nischal Abraham: Better than mine is not much of a compliment considering how bad mine are. You still need glasses
31/10/2020, 09:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2020, 09:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2020, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: I slept very well. Other than my phone buzzing in the morning. There was a storm all night but I didn't hear much of it. My window faces away from the street and the street is very quite anyway
31/10/2020, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: The office one, and the library one, and the downstairs one, and the kitchen one, and there's sofas everywhere. My room is minimal which is good so I have less reason to stay in all day
31/10/2020, 09:48 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome! I look forward to seeing you then :)
31/10/2020, 11:19 - Bee: How's the weather now? I'm going to change the weather location from Kilcock to Cootehill
31/10/2020, 11:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 11:20 - Bee: 😶 sorry dude
31/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: Ahh... But probably doesn't like a difference if the streets are quiet
31/10/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Are you squinting to prevent fogging up?
31/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: I want a house tour man
31/10/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Very windy still but no rains so I finished my shopping
31/10/2020, 11:21 - Bee: No? Does the help? How?!?!?!
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: It hasn't helped me... Why is your face scrunched up then?
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Oh. How far is the grocery store? Does it have everything you'll need?
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Simply. For the photo
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: No reason
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Nischal Abraham: 2 min walking. It has everything for daily needs
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: None
31/10/2020, 11:22 - Bee: Ooohh that's convenient
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: It is! I thought of walking around but it was super super windy. So I'll do the exploring another day.
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Bee: How's your first day going?
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Also I'm very hungry so I want to make something for lunch first
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Bee: Okay byeeee
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: No no
31/10/2020, 11:23 - Bee: It it's only 11:23
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: Not bye. I meant like I didn't want to walk around today
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Oh got it got it
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Oh. I thought you meant you're hungry and want to go make lunch
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: So I looked at the time
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: And it's only 11:23
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Then I thought maybe the unpacking tired you out
31/10/2020, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: The winds are loud enough to be heard indoors. Put a batch of clothes for the wash and unpacking my groceries now
31/10/2020, 11:25 - Bee: Did your clothes from yesterday dry? Or was it the day before yesterday
31/10/2020, 11:25 - Nischal Abraham: It was half dry when I had to pack it. So first part of unpacking was putting those clothes up for drying here
31/10/2020, 11:25 - Nischal Abraham: I left them overnight they were dry this morning
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Bee: There is a dryinyrack right?
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Drying*
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2020, 11:27 - Bee: The white one?
31/10/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: Yep 😁
31/10/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: Debby you'd be really good at those picture games where you have to look for hidden things
31/10/2020, 11:28 - Bee: Dairy milk is bare minimum?!
31/10/2020, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: 1 chocolate is always bare minimum
31/10/2020, 11:29 - Bee: Are the groceries here cheaper?
31/10/2020, 11:29 - Bee: Noted
31/10/2020, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. I'd say around the same. The non-branded versions are reasonably priced
31/10/2020, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: That's in comparison with Kilcock btw. Not India
31/10/2020, 11:30 - Bee: I loved those kinda games as a kid
31/10/2020, 11:30 - Bee: Obviously not India dude
31/10/2020, 11:30 - Bee: What men
31/10/2020, 11:31 - Bee: I loved word puzzles too
31/10/2020, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Like crosswords?
31/10/2020, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: What men?
31/10/2020, 11:31 - Bee: No not like crosswords
31/10/2020, 11:32 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 11:32 - Bee: Word search puzzles
31/10/2020, 11:32 - Bee: What men?
31/10/2020, 11:32 - Bee: 🤔
31/10/2020, 11:35 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yea I used to like solving the ones Nidhi did over her shoulder so she couldn't do them
31/10/2020, 11:36 - Nischal Abraham: Did you leave early today?
31/10/2020, 11:37 - Bee: 😐
31/10/2020, 11:39 - Bee: When we went to Delhi last year, Jo brought her book of word searches and aksed me to solve them with her. I would find 10 and she would find just 1. After two word searches she said she's bored and didn't want to play anymore. I felt bad 😂 I was enjoying them so much and forgot about ehr
31/10/2020, 11:39 - Bee: Her*
31/10/2020, 11:39 - Bee: Nope. Same time
31/10/2020, 11:39 - Bee: It was a relaxing day today
31/10/2020, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: So we're the same then 😂
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: Nice 😌. Let me know when you're down for a call
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Bee: I will. :)
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Bee: I had a nice dream last night
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: Do you remember it?
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Bee: But I already wrote about it to you on Pinterest
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Bee: I do
31/10/2020, 11:41 - Bee: Before I could forget
31/10/2020, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: Smart writing it down. I usually forget after I wake up
31/10/2020, 11:43 - Bee: I usually do too. This was a good one. I won't forget it
31/10/2020, 11:44 - Nischal Abraham: Any other plans for your day today?
31/10/2020, 11:46 - Bee: Nope. Maybe a shawarma if Jason is up for it
31/10/2020, 11:47 - Nischal Abraham: TODAY IS SHAWARMA DAY!
31/10/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: How are you so casual about this 😮
31/10/2020, 11:52 - Bee: Jason called 2 seconds after I sent this message
31/10/2020, 11:52 - Bee: 😂
31/10/2020, 11:52 - Bee: I'm kinda tired of shawarmas now.
31/10/2020, 11:52 - Bee: I had 4 this month
31/10/2020, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: So not going today?
31/10/2020, 11:53 - Bee: Not even a whole month. Been 3 weeks since my first
31/10/2020, 11:53 - Bee: I am. 😛
31/10/2020, 11:53 - Bee: Last day
31/10/2020, 11:53 - Bee: No more buy 1 get 1 free offer
31/10/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha. It would be nice to get it
31/10/2020, 12:00 - Bee: What are you doing?
31/10/2020, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: Making some rice. It's always nice to have leftover rice around
31/10/2020, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: Also figuring my way out around an induction range
31/10/2020, 12:03 - Bee: You're in the kitchen. With your phone?
31/10/2020, 12:03 - Bee: Don't they need vessels with a flat bottom or something like that?
31/10/2020, 12:04 - Nischal Abraham: Why won't I have my phone?
31/10/2020, 12:05 - Bee: I thought you leave your phone upstairs when you cook
31/10/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: That's what I thought too... And my saucepan and frying pan are induction-approved... But I checked Google and as long as I adjust the heat right you can use any full metal utensil
31/10/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: So cooker is 👍
31/10/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: Well anyway the water is boiling at least so that's a good sign. I'll let you know if it ends up failing 😅
31/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: Oh. TIL
31/10/2020, 12:09 - Bee: Plastic handles are okay?
31/10/2020, 12:10 - Bee: I'm hoping it doesn't
31/10/2020, 12:10 - Nischal Abraham: Looks alright for now... The heat is still from the bottom so I don't see how the handle would be affected
31/10/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Cool
31/10/2020, 12:14 - Bee: What are you making along with rice?
31/10/2020, 12:14 - Nischal Abraham: You need something else other than rice?
31/10/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Gravy?
31/10/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Vegetable?
31/10/2020, 12:19 - Bee: No?
31/10/2020, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: Haha I'm just laughing at my own jokes again. I'll make an omelette for myself
31/10/2020, 12:24 - Bee: Like you always do?
31/10/2020, 12:29 - Nischal Abraham: Well I've been cooking for myself for a while so I haven't had someone else make an omelette for me
31/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: Haha very funny. That's the funniest thing I've heard this past month. Thanks for making me laugh out loud Nischal. How can I ever repay you
31/10/2020, 12:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/10/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: Have fun!
31/10/2020, 13:17 - Bee: Hi
31/10/2020, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Hey

31/10/2020, 13:28 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
31/10/2020, 13:28 - Bee: I'll call?
31/10/2020, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'm going to pee. Will call back if i don't pick up
31/10/2020, 13:46 - Bee: Nischal
31/10/2020, 13:46 - Bee: Can I call you after I've taken a bath
31/10/2020, 13:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'm on a call with parents so take your time
31/10/2020, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm done with the call
31/10/2020, 14:12 - Bee: And I haven't had my shower yet. I was chatting with Radhika
31/10/2020, 14:12 - Bee: She got her results and scored a 10 pointer!
31/10/2020, 14:13 - Bee: I'll be quick. Bye.
31/10/2020, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. I'm free whenever you are
31/10/2020, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: What!? Is that even possible?
31/10/2020, 14:33 - Bee: I don't know. All my scoring was in percentages only
31/10/2020, 14:33 - Bee: I'll call?
31/10/2020, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: yep
31/10/2020, 17:56 - Bee: Hi
31/10/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
31/10/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Still awake?

31/10/2020, 17:57 - Bee: Ready for bed now
31/10/2020, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Chinese takeout with Timon at Gareth's place
31/10/2020, 17:57 - Bee: 🤩
31/10/2020, 17:58 - Bee: How far is Gareth's place?
31/10/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Though I don't know when. Timon said he'll let me know
31/10/2020, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Not too far... I think half an hour from where I am
31/10/2020, 17:58 - Bee: Okay
31/10/2020, 17:58 - Bee: How are you?
31/10/2020, 17:58 - Bee: Still windy outside?
31/10/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Doing good 😁. Listening to Out of The Dust and Jacob Collier
31/10/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I have a few things on my mind. I will share them the next time we talk
31/10/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Windy yep... But not stormy like
31/10/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Oh. I haven't heard it
31/10/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Note them down. And how are you?
31/10/2020, 17:59 - Bee: Calmer than before?

31/10/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I saw people walking around alright
31/10/2020, 18:00 - Bee: <Media omitted>

Don't know if I've shared that before
31/10/2020, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: She's not a baby anymore
31/10/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Best part? I like that song. Don't know if this is the same one
31/10/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Is the line

31/10/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Seeeeeeee

01/11/2020, 07:49 - Bee: Waiting for the kids to come now
01/11/2020, 09:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hi! Hope your time with the kids is lovely 😊
01/11/2020, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: Dinner was wonderful! But I was home by 8pm. The 'Reading the Bible' group was on and thats what kept me up for a while
01/11/2020, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: We played games after the reading 😁
01/11/2020, 10:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/11/2020, 10:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: Forgive my ignorance, but that looks like a very big baby for 6 months 😮
01/11/2020, 11:09 - Nischal Abraham: Looks like you're a stalker in this one 😂
01/11/2020, 11:10 - Nischal Abraham: After my meeting with Fairview I'll be heading for lunch to Gareth's place
01/11/2020, 11:11 - Bee: Meeting with Fairview isn't over yet?
01/11/2020, 11:11 - Bee: Brb
01/11/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Worship is over. It's the break before the message
01/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Ahh
01/11/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: We take a 10-15 min break in between. Which ends in 1 min so I'll talk after 😁
01/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: I'm babysitting AAA
01/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Okay bye
01/11/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: Byee! Have fun 😊
01/11/2020, 15:26 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/11/2020, 15:40 - Bee: What did y'all play?
01/11/2020, 15:41 - Bee: I think he's perfect for 6 months
01/11/2020, 15:41 - Bee: 😂
01/11/2020, 15:41 - Bee: I am a stalker
01/11/2020, 15:41 - Bee: Let me know if you'll be free for a call whenever
01/11/2020, 18:09 - Bee: Hi bb
01/11/2020, 18:09 - Bee: I'm off to bed
01/11/2020, 18:10 - Bee: I hope you're having a splendid day ☺️
01/11/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Are you a double? The thought of you always floats inside my head.
01/11/2020, 18:13 - Bee: Goodnight, my beloved. :)))
01/11/2020, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: Aww that's nice! Ashley looks different from when I last saw him
01/11/2020, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: Contact, 21 questions (Bible edition) and Skribbl.io
01/11/2020, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know many 6 month olds I guess
01/11/2020, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: I just got back from Gareth and Maggie's. The girls are sooo adorable Debby!! I have soooooo much to tell you but that's for when we get to talk next
01/11/2020, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: It was a splendid day indeed
01/11/2020, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's a clever one 😁
01/11/2020, 21:05 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! And Good Morning for when you end up seeing all these messages ☺️. I don't know if you're finally on night shift or not. Let me know
01/11/2020, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: Either way you are always in my prayers. Have a great first day back 😊
02/11/2020, 05:29 - Bee: Must be the beard
02/11/2020, 05:30 - Bee: Looking forward to it 😊
02/11/2020, 05:30 - Bee: Not my own
02/11/2020, 05:30 - Bee: Good morning, bb. I go in at 7pm today
02/11/2020, 05:31 - Bee: Thank you. :)
02/11/2020, 05:32 - Bee: Night shift yes
02/11/2020, 05:46 - Bee: Praying for you too. I hope your have a great first day at work. :)
02/11/2020, 07:54 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely the beard
02/11/2020, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I realise we may not get to talk much or very soon. I'll find out my timings a bit more after today so I'll let you know
02/11/2020, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee 😊
02/11/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Yes we may not get to talk for a while :(
02/11/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Let me know your timings
02/11/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Whenever
02/11/2020, 09:50 - Bee: I'll going to take a nap
02/11/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Meeting Daniel before I leave
02/11/2020, 09:50 - Bee: It's his birthday today
02/11/2020, 13:37 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes his birthday! Thanks for the reminder again. Hope you have a fun meeting
02/11/2020, 13:38 - Bee: Met him around 5
02/11/2020, 13:38 - Bee: At the hospital now
02/11/2020, 13:39 - Bee: (2 hours ago)
02/11/2020, 13:39 - Bee: I hope you're having a good day. 😊
02/11/2020, 14:14 - Nischal Abraham: It's been busy. But going on quite well. On a lunch break now
02/11/2020, 14:15 - Nischal Abraham: There's a lot of information to take in since it's my first day. But I should get the hang of it
02/11/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: How's your first night shift going?
02/11/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
02/11/2020, 18:57 - Bee: 😔. Now I remember why I never liked night shifts.
02/11/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Please pray for me Nischal
02/11/2020, 18:57 - Bee: I almost cried
02/11/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Done counting?
02/11/2020, 18:58 - Bee: I wish I had this work
02/11/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying Debby 🙁. Don't you worry cause you're in the hands of the God who made everything
02/11/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Done work for the day. Went to shop for some small stuff and now I'm going to make dinner + something for tomorrow's lunch
02/11/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: It's amazing to see how so many people volunteer their time to make this work. Most of the markers for the papers are volunteers
02/11/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Thank you for the reminder. I will listen to that song on my way back tomorrow
02/11/2020, 19:06 - Bee: What are you making?
02/11/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Yeah? That's amazing. Storing treasures in heaven
02/11/2020, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: I was thinking of making spaghetti with broccoli and mushroom
02/11/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
02/11/2020, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Okay I changed my mind. I looked at the time and I need to take a shower as well so just making packet soup for the night
02/11/2020, 20:10 - Bee: It's only 8:10
02/11/2020, 20:10 - Bee: What about tomorrow's lunch then?
02/11/2020, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: I've got luncheons and bread
02/11/2020, 20:11 - Nischal Abraham: My timings are probably going to be 9 to 5ish. Probably 6ish
02/11/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: At least for this first week it is
02/11/2020, 20:28 - Bee: Oh
02/11/2020, 20:28 - Bee: Tiring day?
02/11/2020, 20:28 - Bee: 9-5 is good right
02/11/2020, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: More mentally than physically. I was just sitting for the most part... But so many new things to register and I'm battling really hard to build good habits in a new environment
02/11/2020, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: New experiment to see if I start habits while things are new will it just flow into my routine afterwards without much effort
02/11/2020, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: Cause my morning routine is such an effortless habit it's almost more difficult not to do it
02/11/2020, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: It is when you don't have a night shift and we can talk for even 5 min 😁
02/11/2020, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: Are you hanging on? Find things to thank God for... Especially when it feels the worst. Its helped me before
02/11/2020, 20:45 - Bee: Did you have your morning routine today
02/11/2020, 20:45 - Bee: ?
02/11/2020, 20:46 - Bee: The only time that I think might work for both of us is when I wake up for lunch tomorrow while you're preparing to go to work
02/11/2020, 20:46 - Bee: My afternoon your morning
02/11/2020, 20:46 - Bee: But I'm not sure if I'll wake up in time to catch you before you leave
02/11/2020, 20:47 - Bee: Keep a notebook and write down stuff that you might forget
02/11/2020, 20:47 - Bee: Which is everything for me. So I write down almost everything
02/11/2020, 20:47 - Nischal Abraham: I did
02/11/2020, 20:48 - Bee: I am. I'm waiting for the night to be over. I don't like night shifts Nischal. :( But it's a part of my career. I don't know what to do. Truly seeking the Lord's will in all of this
02/11/2020, 20:48 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay... My morning internet starts too late anyway. We'll work something out
02/11/2020, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: You journal?
02/11/2020, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: I write down the stuff I'd want to read again. Well my writing changes all the time so it'll be something else in a few weeks
02/11/2020, 20:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'll ask more in detail after you're done. I'm praying you find the strength to enjoy it
02/11/2020, 20:52 - Bee: Okay
02/11/2020, 20:53 - Bee: No I meant stuff that I'm learning at work and I think will be important but I know that I might forget
02/11/2020, 20:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh from work! Right well it hasn't been too much to keep in mind that I need to write it down yet. Also Maggie already wrote a step by step list for me to follow in case I'm ever lost
02/11/2020, 20:55 - Nischal Abraham: And I'll be doing it everyday so it should become familiar after a while
02/11/2020, 21:01 - Bee: Maggie and Gareth have taken care of everything 😍😮
02/11/2020, 21:02 - Bee: We'll have to meet halfway to work something out
02/11/2020, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: They really have. I'll be going for a walk with Noel tomorrow sometime in the afternoon
02/11/2020, 21:02 - Bee: Noel is Gareth's dad?
02/11/2020, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: My morning internet can start earlier. But it depends on when you'll get up
02/11/2020, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
02/11/2020, 21:05 - Bee: What time works for you? I'll wake up for lunch then
02/11/2020, 21:07 - Bee: Nischal... If I'm asking for too much, tell me. I don't want to interfere with your morning routine...
02/11/2020, 21:08 - Bee: I'll think of another time that works for both of us
02/11/2020, 21:08 - Bee: But there is not other time that works
02/11/2020, 21:08 - Bee: We can talk in Sunday instead
02/11/2020, 21:08 - Bee: On*
02/11/2020, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: The only other option is to forego every week of your night shifts. Are you okay to do that?
02/11/2020, 21:10 - Nischal Abraham: I'll just wake up earlier Bee... It won't mess with my routine. I'm more worried that you won't be getting enough sleep if you're waking up for lunch early 🙁
02/11/2020, 21:10 - Bee: I am not okay with that but I can survive
02/11/2020, 21:10 - Bee: I'm going to wake up for lunch and go back to sleep anyway. Waking up for lunch because I don't want to skip meals
02/11/2020, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... So call while you're having lunch then?
02/11/2020, 21:11 - Bee: Is that okay with you?
02/11/2020, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: It is. Is it okay with you?
02/11/2020, 21:12 - Bee: It is
02/11/2020, 21:12 - Bee: More than okay.
02/11/2020, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: What time for you is that?
02/11/2020, 21:12 - Bee: Are you?
02/11/2020, 21:12 - Bee: 1:30 should be okay
02/11/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: That's prefect for me
02/11/2020, 21:13 - Bee: Okay. Thank you, Nischal.
02/11/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: I can be
02/11/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: Talk to you in 11 hours then 😊
02/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Yep.
02/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: I know you're free spirited and all but it's hard for me to go without talking Nischal
02/11/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: I hope that gives you enough motivation to get through tonight!
02/11/2020, 21:15 - Bee: If we must, then I'll survive. But if there's a way we can talk, I'd rather have that
02/11/2020, 21:15 - Bee: It does. You have no idea.
02/11/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: I understand... I look forward to talking to you
02/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal.
02/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Goodnight :)
02/11/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a good night too!
03/11/2020, 06:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I'm free for a call whenever you're up
03/11/2020, 06:58 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your sleep was restful 😊
03/11/2020, 08:12 - Bee: Give me 2 minutes
03/11/2020, 08:14 - Bee: I'll call?
03/11/2020, 08:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
03/11/2020, 08:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying for your day Bee! I hope you find something to look forward to in your night shifts
03/11/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Thank you nana. :)
03/11/2020, 12:54 - Nischal Abraham: Travelling?
03/11/2020, 12:54 - Bee: How's your day going?
03/11/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Lunch break?
03/11/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Yes
03/11/2020, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's been good. Data entry into the computer today
03/11/2020, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: I could. Just finished a pile of papers
03/11/2020, 12:55 - Bee: What's for lunch?
03/11/2020, 12:55 - Nischal Abraham: Sandwich with cold cuts
03/11/2020, 12:55 - Bee: Oh
03/11/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: What was your lunch?
03/11/2020, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: I did take a lunch break
03/11/2020, 13:02 - Bee: I had puris and potato bhaji
03/11/2020, 13:02 - Bee: I've got fish curry and rice for dinner
03/11/2020, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: All sounds so good!
03/11/2020, 13:03 - Bee: It was and will be!!!
03/11/2020, 13:03 - Bee: Sandwiches ready?
03/11/2020, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: Making them
03/11/2020, 13:03 - Bee: How long is your lunch break?
03/11/2020, 13:03 - Bee: Ahh
03/11/2020, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: Till I'm done eating I guess 😂
03/11/2020, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: It's not very official as such
03/11/2020, 13:04 - Bee: Just a heads up. I may run out of internet any moment. I don't know how. I didn't even download anything
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Bee: Oh 😂
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Bee: That's nice
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Ah alright
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Bee: But you probably won't take too long
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yea but I think yesterday it was 45 min
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Because I was making something for rice
03/11/2020, 13:05 - Bee: What did you make?
03/11/2020, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: Just tomato, onions and mushroom stir fried with soy sauce
03/11/2020, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't have any meat unfortunately. Which is what prompted yesterday's shopping trip
03/11/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Do you like soya sauce? Or do you use it out of convenie?
03/11/2020, 13:08 - Bee: What
03/11/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Convenience*
03/11/2020, 13:08 - Bee: So many things seem to have soya sauce in them
03/11/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Convenience. And it's an easy taste addition
03/11/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: I guess I just said convenience in two different ways
03/11/2020, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: So many of my cooking?
03/11/2020, 13:12 - Bee: Yes?
03/11/2020, 13:13 - Bee: Noodles
03/11/2020, 13:13 - Bee: Now side dishes with rice
03/11/2020, 13:13 - Bee: Fried rice
03/11/2020, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's cause it's the same preparation. I just swapped the rice for noodles
03/11/2020, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: And mushrooms for meat
03/11/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: And sometimes add garlic as well
03/11/2020, 13:14 - Bee: Not tired of the same taste? How.!?!?!?!
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Much like my dad's cooking mine tastes different every time 😂
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Bee: 😂
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Bee: Your dad's cooking is goooood
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: So if it's noodles there'll be oregano added as well
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Bee: I remember this beef curry he made once. It tasted amazing
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: And with fried rice sometimes there's scrambled eggs
03/11/2020, 13:15 - Bee: I kept tasting it every time I went to the kitchen 😂
03/11/2020, 13:16 - Bee: Why no scrambled eggs with noodles
03/11/2020, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: It really is. That is very different from my cooking
03/11/2020, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: Never tried it yet. I usually had sausages
03/11/2020, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: But that's where the taste varies
03/11/2020, 13:16 - Bee: Oh. As long as there's some non veg
03/11/2020, 13:17 - Bee: Cool cool
03/11/2020, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: I do it cause it takes me like 20 min to make so it's really quick
03/11/2020, 13:17 - Bee: What if you bought fish sauce or oyster sauce and added those too?
03/11/2020, 13:17 - Bee: Along with soya sauce
03/11/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: Yep the recipe has them. I never did
03/11/2020, 13:18 - Bee: I've looked for fish sauce everywhere. Couldn't find it
03/11/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Ching's sells them. But always out of stock
03/11/2020, 13:18 - Bee: How's the sandwich?
03/11/2020, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'll look around here. Are they the same thing?
03/11/2020, 13:19 - Bee: No they're different
03/11/2020, 13:19 - Bee: But you don't need to have both
03/11/2020, 13:19 - Bee: One of them is finw
03/11/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: It's good. Missing lettuce
03/11/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I'll keep that in mind
03/11/2020, 13:21 - Bee: It'll be gooooood
03/11/2020, 13:21 - Bee: What about adding capsicums? Red yellow and green
03/11/2020, 13:21 - Bee: Yellow is my favourite
03/11/2020, 13:21 - Bee: I can eat it raw
03/11/2020, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: I've never noticed a difference between red and yellow
03/11/2020, 13:22 - Bee: The taste is slightly different
03/11/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. I guess I haven't had enough of them then. Green used to be in every sandwich I've had on the roadside so I'm familiar with its taste
03/11/2020, 13:24 - Bee: Yes those are there everywhere
03/11/2020, 13:25 - Bee: Nischal, thank you for the call in the morning.

03/11/2020, 13:29 - Bee: Thank you. :)
03/11/2020, 13:29 - Nischal Abraham: 1 hour after I get up. That's how long quiet time usually is
03/11/2020, 13:29 - Bee: Trying hard to hang on
03/11/2020, 13:29 - Bee: Okay
03/11/2020, 13:29 - Bee: I hope the rest of your day goes well
03/11/2020, 13:29 - Bee: Bye bb

03/11/2020, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: Byee Bee ☺️
03/11/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Just a reminder that our God neither slumbers or sleeps. He's with you in the day shifts and the night shifts
03/11/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Just came back from an hour long walk with Noel. It was lovely chatting with him. I'll probably be getting Wednesday and Friday off in the week. But if there's a need for extra hands I'll be called in but on a regular that would be the case
03/11/2020, 20:54 - Bee: Hey!
03/11/2020, 20:54 - Bee: Tonight has been good so far. Busy outside but at peace inside
03/11/2020, 20:55 - Bee: So Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays?
03/11/2020, 20:55 - Bee: Wow
03/11/2020, 20:56 - Nischal Abraham: I guess so? I'll definitely know next week. Cause I'm still only expected to work around 20 hours a day
03/11/2020, 20:56 - Nischal Abraham: Dinner break?
03/11/2020, 20:56 - Bee: So that's 2 and a half days of 9-5
03/11/2020, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: It won't be 9-5 everyday... These initial days are so Maggie can show me around to all the things that need to be done
03/11/2020, 20:57 - Bee: Nope. Had dinner two.hours ago. I was hungry then. Nothing to do until 5 now
03/11/2020, 20:57 - Nischal Abraham: You're off at 5? Not too long left then 😊
03/11/2020, 20:57 - Bee: Oh. When is Maggie due? Until when is she going to come in to PBS?
03/11/2020, 20:58 - Bee: No no. Off at 7. But no work until 5
03/11/2020, 20:58 - Bee: I can sit until 5
03/11/2020, 20:58 - Nischal Abraham: Sometime in January I think. I think she'll come till the end of this month. I can see her pause every so often and take a heavy breath
03/11/2020, 20:58 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! On call?
03/11/2020, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know how any nursing thing works... That's just a random guess
03/11/2020, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: One day explain it to me
03/11/2020, 21:00 - Bee: Nope
03/11/2020, 21:00 - Bee: I will nana
03/11/2020, 21:00 - Bee: Oh... Pregnancy is hard
03/11/2020, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: It sure looks like it. So what'll you do till 5? Can you nap? Do you want to nap?
03/11/2020, 21:02 - Bee: I want to nap but I don't know if I'll get to. Don't feel like napping when the rest are working. I'm done with my stuff. But still
03/11/2020, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... So what else will you do?
03/11/2020, 21:09 - Bee: Looking for work to do
03/11/2020, 21:09 - Bee: Or I'll read something
03/11/2020, 21:10 - Bee: Can't. Too sleepy to read
03/11/2020, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: I have so many questions about your work... I don't even know if I'll ever get a chance to ask them 😂
03/11/2020, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: But I hope you find what you're looking for. I'm here if nothing else
03/11/2020, 21:12 - Bee: Why won't you get a chance to ask them?
03/11/2020, 21:13 - Bee: I didn't have my quiet time the last two days
03/11/2020, 21:13 - Bee: Three days
03/11/2020, 21:13 - Bee: Isn't it Wednesday today?
03/11/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: For you it is
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Sunday and Monday because I was worrying about Monday night. Tuesday because I was sleeping
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: You can do that now!
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: I will have my quiet time now.
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Yes.
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: Go on then. I shall disturb you no longer
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: You're not disturbing me
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: But yes
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: What's for dinner?
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Bee: Have you eaten yet?
03/11/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: I finished up leftover Scones
03/11/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: I think 3 was too many and now I feel too full
03/11/2020, 21:15 - Bee: Are scones sweet?
03/11/2020, 21:15 - Bee: Or savory?
03/11/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: More sweet than savory. They're like patties but look like muffins
03/11/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: And feels more like bread
03/11/2020, 21:15 - Bee: You had sweet for dinner 😮
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Oh
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Just scones then?
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: So you finished dinner?
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: And it's only 9!!!
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: What are you going to do now?
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: Too much for me... But I didn't want it to go waste. With peanut butter and jam spread
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: Whhhaaa
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: This doesn't sound like you
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: I finished by 8 yesterday
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Bee: 😂
03/11/2020, 21:16 - Nischal Abraham: Today I went for the walk so it took longer
03/11/2020, 21:17 - Bee: Your schedule is #goals man
03/11/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: Pray as you enjoy quiet time
03/11/2020, 21:17 - Nischal Abraham: And watch some YT videos... Then read some... Then sleep

03/11/2020, 21:17 - Bee: I shall disturb you no longer

04/11/2020, 07:55 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby! I hope your sleep was restful. I'm free when you are
04/11/2020, 08:08 - Bee: Hi
04/11/2020, 08:08 - Bee: Good morning bb
04/11/2020, 08:08 - Bee: I'll call?
04/11/2020, 08:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
04/11/2020, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: Every place here is so pretty! Just trees and greenery all round
04/11/2020, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: Also I found oyster sauce so that's gonna be included in my next cooking attempt
04/11/2020, 13:24 - Bee: I'm guessing today was a holiday then?
04/11/2020, 13:25 - Bee: Yay! Looking forward to hearing how it tastes!!
04/11/2020, 13:25 - Bee: I'm sure. Take pictures if you can!
04/11/2020, 13:26 - Nischal Abraham: I will on my next walk. I'd forgotten that the fairy forest is here. I don't know if I mentioned that in my January stories of walking with Daniel and Noel
04/11/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: It was. I read some, took a nice long walk. Was planning on cooking for lunch but there's a water cut so I guess I'm settling for sandwich for lunch as well 😶
04/11/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: Although I did buy cheese slices so it'll be slightly tastier
04/11/2020, 13:35 - Bee: Fairy forest?!?!?!
04/11/2020, 13:36 - Bee: You mentioned something about the sets of GoT. Was it there?
04/11/2020, 13:36 - Bee: Maybe add some oyster sauce?
04/11/2020, 13:36 - Bee: 🤩
04/11/2020, 13:36 - Bee: Now you can add it to everything instead of soya sauce 😛
04/11/2020, 14:28 - Bee: Nischal, please pray for mummy and her eyesight. She underwent a major lens transplant surgery two years ago because of issues with her retina. It wasn't a definite cure as this is a rare case. Today was her follow up and the retinal scan showed that there has been no improvement and the retina is continuously getting eroded. It's affecting her eyesight
04/11/2020, 15:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying
04/11/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Yea there's a story behind it. I'll explain it someday on call
04/11/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: No this is different
04/11/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't add it to the sandwich. You let me know how that tastes
04/11/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Uhhhhhhhh I don't have oyster sauce at home
04/11/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Thank you bb
04/11/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Starting work for the day?
04/11/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Started 4ish hours ago
04/11/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Didn't realise the time. Dinner time then?
04/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Nope. Got a few minutes to sit and breathe. Will go have dinner in 20 minutes
04/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Waiting for Tijy to finish her stuff. Will eat with her
04/11/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's nice you have company. Is she working in the same place?
04/11/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Only until tomorrow. Then she will be in college. What will I do without her?!??
04/11/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Yes. The floor above mine

04/11/2020, 21:39 - Nischal Abraham: Never mind. Waters gone out again so no cooking tonight
04/11/2020, 21:49 - Bee: I can sleep for an hour!!! Will reply properly later of that's okay.

05/11/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you. Take the doubts to Him who can clear them
05/11/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Thank you
05/11/2020, 17:16 - Bee: I've been reciting verses in my mind throughout
05/11/2020, 17:16 - Bee: I wish I had memorized more.
05/11/2020, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be of little help other than being a listening ear
05/11/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: There'll always be opportunity to do that
05/11/2020, 17:17 - Bee: You're praying. That's everything

06/11/2020, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Not a single one of those leaves will fall without God's knowledge. You are more important to Him than the trees and the leaves Bee. 
Although the seasons change his mercies are new. Be anxious for nothing. Much prayer is made for you 😊
06/11/2020, 19:56 - Bee: Were you trespassing?
06/11/2020, 19:56 - Bee: The place is beautiful, Nischal
06/11/2020, 19:56 - Bee: And these are just photos
06/11/2020, 19:56 - Bee: Can't imagine how prettier it must be in person
06/11/2020, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: Nope I stopped at the gate. Though Gareth did tell me a way to get past it. I'll leave that for next time. There's a mansion of a house on the other side
06/11/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Thank you Nischal
06/11/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Today is been an okay day. Surprisingly
06/11/2020, 20:08 - Bee: Much needed reminder
06/11/2020, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: 😊. Well I'll reply later. Keep your messages coming. I've just joined the Bible reading
06/11/2020, 20:22 - Bee: 😊
06/11/2020, 20:22 - Bee: Enjoy Bible reading. In 3 versions 😊
06/11/2020, 20:22 - Bee: I had a nice time of dinner even though Tijy wasn't there
06/11/2020, 20:22 - Bee: God takes care of the little things
06/11/2020, 20:23 - Bee: There's a senior staff nurse on Tijy's floor who's been quite friendly. The talkative one? That one. She ate dinner with me
06/11/2020, 20:23 - Bee: It was nice ya.
06/11/2020, 20:24 - Bee: Don't reply. Obv. Just keeping the messages coming
06/11/2020, 20:34 - Bee: <Media omitted>
06/11/2020, 21:41 - Bee: Gonna sleep for an hour 🥳
06/11/2020, 21:41 - Bee: Goodnight - if you're asleep before I wake up.
06/11/2020, 21:41 - Bee: Talk to you tomorrow 😊
06/11/2020, 23:11 - Nischal Abraham: It was a lovely time
06/11/2020, 23:11 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! Thanking God for big mercies 😊. Company for meals is such a blessing
06/11/2020, 23:12 - Nischal Abraham: ‼️‼️
06/11/2020, 23:13 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'll be falling asleep very very easily tonight. Long walks and late night. Well I don't want it to be any later and miss a very important call in the morning
06/11/2020, 23:16 - Nischal Abraham: I pray the rest of your night progresses well 😊. Praise God for the good and bad. Romans 5 was read three times over and this verse stood out every time
06/11/2020, 23:17 - Nischal Abraham: Romans 5: 3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
06/11/2020, 23:18 - Nischal Abraham: Which leads back to the hope mentioned in Lamentations 3 if you remember
06/11/2020, 23:20 - Nischal Abraham: Lamentations 3: 19 Remember my affliction and roaming,
The wormwood and the gall.
20 My soul still remembers
And sinks within me.
21 This I recall to my mind,
Therefore I have hope.

It was in their suffering that hope is generated. And concludes in that most amazing verse
06/11/2020, 23:20 - Nischal Abraham: v24 “The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,
“Therefore I hope in Him!”
06/11/2020, 23:22 - Nischal Abraham: Well just a few thoughts that propped up in my head over the reading. I really do wish there is more I can do to comfort you. But with our present situation encouragement and prayer is all I can give. And banking up a 100 more hugs for when I can give them
07/11/2020, 03:04 - Bee: What important call? It better not interfere with my most important call 🤔
07/11/2020, 04:27 - Bee: Added to the list of verses I need to memorize. I don't know how long it will take for the ultimate fruit. Maybe there is no _ultimate_ fruit? But is a daily thing. Obviously. One day at a time
07/11/2020, 04:27 - Bee: I do now
07/11/2020, 04:31 - Bee: There is!!! It is to be in the likeness of our Lord Jesus. Which will take at least a million years. But one day at a time
07/11/2020, 04:32 - Bee: Everything was going too well for me. I became complacent. Kinda like the the people in lamentations
07/11/2020, 04:33 - Bee: You're doing everything and more, Nischal. I will be holding you to your offer of a 100 hugs definitely
07/11/2020, 04:33 - Bee: I'm off to bed
07/11/2020, 04:34 - Bee: I have an important call to make once I'm up
07/11/2020, 04:34 - Bee: Bye
07/11/2020, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee! Hope your sleep was restful 😊
07/11/2020, 08:04 - Bee: Hi Nischal
07/11/2020, 08:04 - Bee: It was
07/11/2020, 08:04 - Bee: Give me 5
07/11/2020, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing
07/11/2020, 08:10 - Bee: I'll call?
07/11/2020, 08:54 - Bee: <Media omitted>
07/11/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Aww! That's all the love and prayers Debby
07/11/2020, 08:55 - Bee: It is
07/11/2020, 08:55 - Bee: 🥺
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Surrounded by God's goodness.
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: Are you going to cry yourself to sleep?
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Bee: After lunch yes
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Bee: 😂
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Nischal man.
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Bee: I don't appreciate you enough.
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Bee: I mean I don't tell you enough
07/11/2020, 08:56 - Nischal Abraham: Still not had lunch!? Call with Ruth and Sammy?
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Eating now
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay.
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Was on a call until now
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: I know you do and more ☺️
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Seee?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: Ah alright. Enjoy your lunch. I'm going to take a shower now
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: This is what I'm talking about
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Okay bb
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: Bye!
07/11/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: Gareth picks me up in an hour
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Okay
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: I thought recording will be in the office?
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Isn't there a setup of lights and a mic
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Nope it's fancy outdoors recording
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Oh wow
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Cool
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Bye!n
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Yea for the green screen
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'll tell you in detail when we talk next
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Nischal Abraham: Byeee!
07/11/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Yep
07/11/2020, 08:59 - Nischal Abraham: P.s. I miss you loads. Bucket loads
07/11/2020, 09:22 - Bee: I miss you Ocean loads
07/11/2020, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm back home! It was lovely out shooting a video.
07/11/2020, 12:41 - Nischal Abraham: I say lovely but I was freezing as time went by 😂. Got my gloves on by the end of it
07/11/2020, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: And we ended the day going to Johnny's parents house. It was a wonderful time there too. 
(Johnny was another guy helping out with the video today)
07/11/2020, 13:35 - Bee: 😂
07/11/2020, 13:36 - Bee: Does Johnny work at PBS too? Or was it just for the video?
07/11/2020, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: Just for the video. He was environmental engineer. Has a powerful testimony of being injured and healed by God's grace
07/11/2020, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: The topic of the video was miracles so it had him talking about his life and energy in nature that we observe
07/11/2020, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/11/2020, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: That should give an idea
07/11/2020, 13:44 - Bee: Please tell me about it when we talk 😊
07/11/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Blue skies so pretty
07/11/2020, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: Those blue skies turned gray very very soon after 😂. And temperature must've dropped 5-7°
07/11/2020, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: Are you on your way to the hospital?
07/11/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Though guessing by the time you
07/11/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: are probably in already. I'm praying you have a great last day!
07/11/2020, 13:47 - Bee: I have an 8-8 shift tonight... I am on my way
07/11/2020, 13:47 - Bee: Last day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
07/11/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hope the sweet stuff gives you enough to carry you through 😋
07/11/2020, 13:48 - Bee: I forgot to carry it with me 😭
07/11/2020, 13:48 - Bee: So stupid. Shyaaaa.
07/11/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: Ah it's alright... Something to look forward to when you get back then
07/11/2020, 13:49 - Bee: How do you survive man
07/11/2020, 13:49 - Bee: Yes
07/11/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: With gloves and a hoody
07/11/2020, 13:49 - Bee: A hoody is sufficient?
07/11/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: In the train now?
07/11/2020, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: For the ears it is. For the body there's a jacket as well. Legs don't get cold easily so jeans are fine
07/11/2020, 13:50 - Nischal Abraham: And I was wearing my heavier shoes since I knew we'd be walking on rough terrain
07/11/2020, 13:50 - Bee: No thermal leggings?
07/11/2020, 13:51 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't needed them since Feb I think. My thermals are just in my luggage bag now
07/11/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Probably will take them out in December if it gets too cold. But my skin goes super dry under them so I try to avoid it
07/11/2020, 13:52 - Bee: You're Irish now. You'll sweat buckets in India
07/11/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'm so scared that'll actually be the case 🙁. I'll melt like an ice cream in summer
07/11/2020, 13:55 - Bee: I wish you could come in the winter.
07/11/2020, 13:55 - Bee: No melting then.
07/11/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that would've just been nice weather to transition into. Well it is what it is
07/11/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: How long till you're at the hospital?
07/11/2020, 13:56 - Bee: 40 minutes
07/11/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... Switching trains tonight?
07/11/2020, 13:57 - Bee: Nope. Got a direct train
07/11/2020, 13:57 - Bee: The frequency is good now. Almost like pre-covid times
07/11/2020, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! And no rush I'm guessing
07/11/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Nope
07/11/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Almost empty
07/11/2020, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds wonderful 😊. Will I be expecting to hear your voice in the next 30 min?
07/11/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Will you be free to hear my voice in 30?
07/11/2020, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: In 30? Maybe not... But I am for now
07/11/2020, 14:01 - Bee: I'll call?
07/11/2020, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: Sure!
07/11/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Do you have a holiday today?
07/11/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Other than the video thing
07/11/2020, 14:48 - Bee: ♥️
07/11/2020, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for the super short call Bee. We went around the forest trail again... This time without needing to take photos 😁
07/11/2020, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: Just got back home now
07/11/2020, 15:28 - Bee: A super short call is better than no call
07/11/2020, 15:28 - Bee: What are your plans?
07/11/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Call with Daniel at 5pm.
07/11/2020, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Then there's a teens thing that's being organised by Gareth and Timon that they may need me to be hosting on Zoom since the office WiFi is better
07/11/2020, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'm skipping out on Among Us today. Too much of anything isn't good
07/11/2020, 15:32 - Nischal Abraham: I was thinking of napping before Timon had called but I don't really feel sleepy anymore. I'll probably just while away till it's call time with Daniel
07/11/2020, 15:33 - Nischal Abraham: How's the hospital looking? Is it gonna be a busy last night?
07/11/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Oh! Please ask how Hannah is doing 😁 and if she's got any new habits/phrases now pleeeaase
07/11/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Oh. Is it just today?
07/11/2020, 16:03 - Bee: Why don't you nap for half an hour?
07/11/2020, 16:03 - Bee: True.
07/11/2020, 16:04 - Bee: Not busier than last night. Just thinking about how I won't have night shifts for a while. That is helping me push through
07/11/2020, 16:04 - Bee: Really wish I could just call you and cry on the phone. Too busy for that
07/11/2020, 16:04 - Bee: Singing the song Hide me now over and over again
07/11/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Will do
07/11/2020, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe today and tomorrow
07/11/2020, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Short naps just end up making me feel worse
07/11/2020, 16:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying Bee. Once it's done you won't even realise the time gone by
07/11/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it's just one night
07/11/2020, 16:42 - Bee: Yessssssssssssssss
07/11/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Nischal, please know that I am grateful for you and wouldn't want to do life with anyone else. Thank you.
07/11/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Just a reminder
07/11/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Byyeee
07/11/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for the reminders. I'm grateful to be sharing this heart with you too ☺️
07/11/2020, 21:46 - Bee: True true. It's going alright :) alright is good.
07/11/2020, 21:48 - Bee: 😊
07/11/2020, 21:48 - Bee: I'll talk to you tomorrow if possible?
07/11/2020, 21:48 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :)
07/11/2020, 22:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yes. I'd like that 😊
07/11/2020, 22:10 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I realise you'll likely miss the worship meeting. Remind me to remind you that we must pray together on our call tomorrow
08/11/2020, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Debby. I hope your night continued alright. You're finally done for the week!!! 🎉🎉
08/11/2020, 07:56 - Nischal Abraham: Now that I think about it you should probably just catch up on all the sleep you want. But if you do end up being awake I'm here for a call 😊
08/11/2020, 08:50 - Bee: Hi
08/11/2020, 08:51 - Bee: I just woke up
08/11/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Maybe you're eating breakfast
08/11/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Hi!!!
08/11/2020, 08:52 - Nischal Abraham: Na... Just preparing it
08/11/2020, 08:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
08/11/2020, 08:52 - Bee: Are you free for a call?
08/11/2020, 08:52 - Bee: 1 min

08/11/2020, 17:58 - Bee: Goodnight!
08/11/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. I don't know whether to feel sorry for uncle or think it's really sweet of him to succumb to your coercing
08/11/2020, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you manage to sleep well! I've had a wonderful time at Gareth and Maggie's all day
09/11/2020, 01:32 - Bee: Did you get it?!
09/11/2020, 01:32 - Bee: I slept. I need more sleep
09/11/2020, 01:32 - Bee: The latter obv.
09/11/2020, 01:33 - Bee: Good morning, bb! 😊
09/11/2020, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: I did! Put a smile on my face this morning 😊. You're the bestest of friends Bee
09/11/2020, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: Hopefully you get a chance to today! How was the morning shift?
09/11/2020, 07:59 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! 😊
09/11/2020, 11:26 - Bee: I like doing that. And yes, I am.
09/11/2020, 11:26 - Bee: You should give me a friendship band next year
09/11/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Time went by so fast. Busy. Posted in the ICU. I like ICUs
09/11/2020, 11:27 - Bee: I'm going to nap for a bit as soon as I get home

11/11/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Our call won't end in an hour
11/11/2020, 15:43 - Bee: We have enough time to talk
11/11/2020, 15:44 - Bee: I don't know if it will be enough but it's more than what we've been getting
11/11/2020, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: What time do you plan on going to bed?
11/11/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Doesn't look like 10:30 is possible nana
11/11/2020, 16:34 - Bee: 12:30
11/11/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free anytime from now on. Take your time
11/11/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: What're you upto?
11/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Still eating dinner
11/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: I went over to Jessy moushi's with some of Papa's birthday cake
11/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: It is his birthday today
11/11/2020, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: OH! Your dads?
11/11/2020, 16:38 - Bee: Yes
11/11/2020, 16:38 - Bee: I told you yesterday!!
11/11/2020, 16:38 - Bee: No not yesterday
11/11/2020, 16:38 - Bee: The day before yesterday
11/11/2020, 16:39 - Nischal Abraham: I don't remember :(. But awesome!! Hope it was a fun time!
11/11/2020, 16:39 - Nischal Abraham: What cake is it? Did you do anything special?
11/11/2020, 16:40 - Bee: It was alright
11/11/2020, 16:40 - Bee: I didn't do anything special. It was some Oreo cake
11/11/2020, 16:40 - Bee: I didn't eat much of it. Too much chocolate
11/11/2020, 16:40 - Bee: Not late if you want to send a wish
11/11/2020, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you! I did send him a wish
11/11/2020, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: Ah alright. I'm sure the others must've enjoyed it though
11/11/2020, 16:44 - Bee: You did?!
11/11/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Cool
11/11/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?
11/11/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Papa sure did
11/11/2020, 16:49 - Bee: There's rice, tomato Saar (that tomato rasam kinda thing I told you about?), and fish fry. This is my most favourite combination
11/11/2020, 16:49 - Bee: What are you doing?
11/11/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Just watching some YT. Eating some biscuits. Waiting for whenever you're free :)
11/11/2020, 16:59 - Bee: 5.5 hrs time difference works well when you've got prayer meeting. Random thought
11/11/2020, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: It does. I think it works well for most scenarios
11/11/2020, 17:14 - Bee: I'm going to need at least 20 minutes more
11/11/2020, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool
11/11/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!
11/11/2020, 17:51 - Bee: I'm sorry about the delay Nischal.
11/11/2020, 17:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. Are you free now?
11/11/2020, 17:58 - Bee: I am now
11/11/2020, 17:59 - Bee: I'll call?
11/11/2020, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
11/11/2020, 19:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/11/2020, 08:41 - Bee: Hi buddy. Have a goooooood day okay. Bye buddy.
12/11/2020, 08:46 - Nischal Abraham: Hey pal. I hope you have a good day too! 😊. I'm sure you already have your 3 things since your noon has past. I'll be ready with mine
12/11/2020, 09:56 - Bee: My noon is over and I don't have 3 things
12/11/2020, 09:56 - Bee: I've got 2
12/11/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Its 2 more than I've got
12/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Nischal. Will you be free for a call?
12/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: In 35?
12/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: Later than that works for me. I don't have to wake up early tomorrow
12/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Keeping my phone aside. Please blow up my phone if/when you're free for a call
12/11/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
12/11/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I was chatting with Gareth and the time flew by so quick
12/11/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Are you still free? Is it too late?
12/11/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Are you asleep already?
12/11/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: I mean it's alright if you've gone to sleep. I didn't know how early you'd end up free so I assumed 11 should be a safe bet
12/11/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'm really sorry for the delay 😔. Well if you are around I'm free anytime now
12/11/2020, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: And if you aren't around that's fine. We can still talk tomorrow
12/11/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!!!!
12/11/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you're awake
12/11/2020, 18:14 - Bee: One min
12/11/2020, 18:14 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
12/11/2020, 18:15 - Bee: I'll call?
12/11/2020, 18:15 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
12/11/2020, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Hey

12/11/2020, 20:34 - Bee: ♥️
13/11/2020, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How did it go?
13/11/2020, 09:46 - Bee: Alright. Drove less than 200 meters
13/11/2020, 09:46 - Bee: I passed
13/11/2020, 09:46 - Bee: ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
13/11/2020, 09:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'll consider that to mean it was good
13/11/2020, 09:49 - Bee: It was
13/11/2020, 09:49 - Bee: I'm going to take a nap now
13/11/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Work today? Or holiday?
13/11/2020, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: Off day today
13/11/2020, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: So if you want an early call that'll be possible. STEP preparations will be happening later in the evening
13/11/2020, 09:50 - Bee: What are your plans?
13/11/2020, 09:51 - Bee: What time?
13/11/2020, 09:51 - Bee: STEP prep
13/11/2020, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: Studying. I'll be sharing the message on Sunday so I'll spend time on that today. I doubt I'll find time tomorrow
13/11/2020, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know. Probably 6?
13/11/2020, 09:51 - Bee: Oh
13/11/2020, 09:52 - Bee: My 11:30
13/11/2020, 09:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
13/11/2020, 09:52 - Bee: Okay
13/11/2020, 09:52 - Bee: Before that then
13/11/2020, 09:52 - Nischal Abraham: Well enjoy your nap! We can talk after you're up 😊
13/11/2020, 09:52 - Bee: The call
13/11/2020, 09:53 - Bee: Yes
13/11/2020, 09:53 - Bee: Bye
13/11/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Byee!
13/11/2020, 15:30 - Bee: Nap, sisters' meeting, extended fam meeting done
13/11/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! How's your day been?
13/11/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Good I think? Nice relaxing day at home.
13/11/2020, 17:19 - Bee: I have a holiday tomorrow
13/11/2020, 17:19 - Bee: How's your day going?
13/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: I didn't realize it's 10:50 already
13/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Mummy and I just returned from a drive
13/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: You're going to be busy in 40 minutes right?
13/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Free for a call now?
13/11/2020, 17:23 - Bee: I'm sorry I lost track of time
13/11/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
13/11/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free for a call now
13/11/2020, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Or maybe later. I'll know when someone heads into the office
13/11/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I'll call?
14/11/2020, 05:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/11/2020, 07:43 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll have to admire your post-work skin cause that's the only one I'll be meeting
14/11/2020, 10:04 - Bee: Cool
14/11/2020, 10:04 - Bee: You can
14/11/2020, 11:32 - Bee: It's a baby girl. Mentioned in the video
14/11/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Also, just an idea. Would you like to write a letter to Arpitha? She's been a good friend to you. I'm going to make a card and leave it with mummy to give it to her on Tuesday when she comes over for lunch... I can add yours to the envelope... Just an idea. You don't have to do it
14/11/2020, 11:44 - Bee: I mean I can print it out and add it to the envelope
14/11/2020, 11:44 - Bee: Byyee
14/11/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Goodnight (for when you go to sleep), Nischal. ☺️
14/11/2020, 23:50 - Bee: .
15/11/2020, 00:02 - Nischal Abraham: You're up late! I've been out of the office all day. Came in for work in the afternoon and then out again
15/11/2020, 00:03 - Nischal Abraham: Just got back home a few min back. It's been a lovely day! I was at Timon's with Paddy and we were attending STEP together from there
15/11/2020, 00:24 - Nischal Abraham: That's a nice idea! I'll update you on whether I can do it or not tomorrow. I probably won't find the time to send it over but I'll sure try
15/11/2020, 00:24 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I sleep now. I'm praying your time of worship would be blessed 😊
15/11/2020, 08:47 - Bee: No I woke up early. And went right back to sleep
15/11/2020, 08:48 - Bee: There was STEP in the morning?
15/11/2020, 08:48 - Bee: Oh wow! Must've been a nice time ☺️
15/11/2020, 08:49 - Bee: You can send it by your 2:30ish tomorrow and I'll take a print. It's okay if you can't too
15/11/2020, 08:50 - Bee: It was a blessed time. We went over to Reenee's for worship and lunch
15/11/2020, 08:50 - Bee: Going out with Afroz, Tijy, and Abisha now
15/11/2020, 08:50 - Bee: I'm praying for you and for the words to be God's and not yours.
15/11/2020, 09:32 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that does make more sense
15/11/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: A session in the morning and another in the evening
15/11/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: It was! Too many details to write down in chat. Maybe if we have time I'll tell you over a call
15/11/2020, 09:34 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Thanks Bee
15/11/2020, 09:34 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a nice time 😊
15/11/2020, 09:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes! Have fun eating wonderful food with good company!! 😁
15/11/2020, 09:36 - Nischal Abraham: I thank God for every prayer you make for me. In much prayer I will continue the day both yours and mine
15/11/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: I've got a tight schedule for today as well so I'll probably message much later in the night next. Praying for you always!
15/11/2020, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: So my tight schedule has found loose moments. It's a quiet Sunday afternoon in the McMeeken house this afternoon
15/11/2020, 15:03 - Nischal Abraham: There's rain pattering on the window and a fire that's dying out in the fireplace
15/11/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Had a lovely lunch of Lasagna, boiled corn and chips(potato wedges)
15/11/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: I wasn't too sure how to send what I've typed out. I had an old note I had written a year ago but never sent which I just added to on my phone. I'll send it here in WhatsApp but I'll also try and make a word document of it to make it easier to print
15/11/2020, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: A little more than a year ago an evangelist and his family fellowshipped with Bethesda and mentioned his daughter would be staying back. Me being me I didn't even bother seeing who this daughter was. It wasn't until later that I noticed there's a new person being taken around by Ben and Sahil. Soon I was introduced to you, loud, talkative, seemingly without a care in the world. And no hesitation to talk about the things you're passionate about. 


You are very strongly opinionated. And I think that's a good thing... I found courage in how God worked in your life to change you completely as a person(even though I've only met one side of you). I'm glad for the conversations we could share. I'm even more glad for the trust I could put in you and though I didn't expect it you trusted me too. 




Pause. A year and more of pause. Those were words I'd written in September 2019 as a goodbye note for me leaving to Ireland. A lot has changed for us both since then but I'm thankful that it hasn't been silent changes but very loud ones that clearly show God's hand in them. I don't know if we will ever be led to meet again. But as long as I'll remember I'll try and catch up ever so often through the months with more updates of God's faithfulness. I pray and look forward to seeing God work mightily through you.
15/11/2020, 15:21 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
15/11/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Nischal!!!!!!!
15/11/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Been a busy day for me
15/11/2020, 16:53 - Bee: I hope you remember all of them! Or most of them. Hopefully all of them. But most will do too. But try to remember all of them okay?
15/11/2020, 16:53 - Bee: Duuuuuuuuudddddeeee it was amazing.
15/11/2020, 16:54 - Bee: McMeekan is Gareth's last name?
15/11/2020, 16:54 - Bee: This sounds like the beginning of an interesting book
15/11/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Sunday meals are going to help you reach 65kgs naan
15/11/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Why did you never send it?
15/11/2020, 16:55 - Bee: I like the way you write. :)
15/11/2020, 16:55 - Bee: This is convenient. I will print it out and add it in with my card
15/11/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Or do you want a separate envelope?
15/11/2020, 16:55 - Bee: Let me know
15/11/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Ate so much. Talked so much. Laughed so much
15/11/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Like soooooooooooooooo much
15/11/2020, 17:18 - Bee: My belly and heart is full
15/11/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Nana
15/11/2020, 18:48 - Bee: Bye!
15/11/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: I prefer this. But like it's upto you.
15/11/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'm in a similar state. It's a wonderful feeling ☺️
15/11/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: I don't do well on following up on my ideas
15/11/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
15/11/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'll remember most of it. If I narrate all of it it'll take more than 4 hours to get through
15/11/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: It looks like I'm getting thinner the more that I eat 😂. I need to find time to exercise as well
15/11/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you 😊
15/11/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: I'm happy you had a great time 😁. Looking forward to hearing about it. It better take at least 2 hours to tell me about
16/11/2020, 07:28 - Bee: Same envelope it is, then.
16/11/2020, 07:29 - Bee: If you talk about yours for 4 hours then I'll take 2 hours
16/11/2020, 07:29 - Bee: Eat and exercise then!!! If only it was this easy
16/11/2020, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: If only
16/11/2020, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: You really want me to talk for 4 hours?
16/11/2020, 09:17 - Nischal Abraham: Also, Good afternoon! How's your day going? Will you be free for a call tonight?
16/11/2020, 09:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'm still not sure if I will be free but nothing planned so far so it's a tentative yes for me
16/11/2020, 09:31 - Bee: Sure, why not. It's not like you haven't before
16/11/2020, 09:32 - Bee: I'll be free post 10:30ish
16/11/2020, 09:32 - Bee: My day is going alright. Holiday today. Don't know what to do. I've wasted my morning and noon
16/11/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Why holiday today? Diwali? Didn't you have a holiday on Saturday too? That's a whole vacation!
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: There's some festival today too
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Diwali was yesterday I think
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: No. Diwali was Saturday
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Today is some festival for brothers or something
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Bhaidooj?
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: Bhaubeej?
16/11/2020, 09:36 - Bee: One of the two
16/11/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. So what're you doing for your brothers?
16/11/2020, 09:37 - Bee: I don't celebrate either festival. Why would I do something for my brother
16/11/2020, 09:37 - Bee: Even if I did celebrate, why would I do something for my brothers
16/11/2020, 09:37 - Bee: Just generally, why would I do something for my brothers
16/11/2020, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Cause you're such a loving sister
16/11/2020, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well anyway what's your plans for the day then?
16/11/2020, 09:39 - Bee: Am I, really?
16/11/2020, 09:40 - Bee: I don't have any plans
16/11/2020, 09:49 - Nischal Abraham: Well hope you find something to do in the day. My work starts now so talk to you later! You can script out your 2 hour talk if you want something to do 😂
16/11/2020, 15:27 - Bee: I took a nap, wasted some more time, ate a huge piece of Aflatoon (it is Papa's favourite sweet from his favourite sweet shop in Sandhurst road), went out with maa (me for the drive, maa for buying some home stuff, which we couldn't find and so we bought stuff we didn't know we needed), and now I'm back contemplating on what I should do
16/11/2020, 15:28 - Bee: How's your day going?
16/11/2020, 15:49 - Bee: I don't know if I like Indian sweets anymore
16/11/2020, 16:35 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/11/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Papa looked at his stomach in this one and asked me to take another one
16/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/11/2020, 16:36 - Bee: He wasn't breathing properly 😂
16/11/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Shirtless photos are okay right
16/11/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Have we reached that stage yet
16/11/2020, 16:37 - Bee: Have we
16/11/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a restful day 😊. I need me one of those
16/11/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Busy. I'm still tired out from the weekend and I can feel it in the work I'm doing. Just so slow with everything
16/11/2020, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: Did you have too many?
16/11/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Regardless of his looks uncle is very strong though
16/11/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: Well we are now
16/11/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: From your dad doesn't make much difference to me. If it was from you I'd say we shouldn't be crossing that line yet 😶
16/11/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Wednesday? Friday? Saturday?
16/11/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Oh. We can talk tomorrow instead if you want
16/11/2020, 17:01 - Bee: No I had just one. One was too much. I don't like Indian sweets anymore. At least not for a while
16/11/2020, 17:02 - Bee: That's true. He is. Even now. He's still got huge biceps. I don't know how. I really hope I've got this gene of his
16/11/2020, 17:02 - Bee: We can go back
16/11/2020, 17:03 - Bee: I did think twice before sending that and I thought to myself that I should word it differently but I sent it anyway
16/11/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Yep. Not crossing that line man
16/11/2020, 17:12 - Bee: By 'that' I mean
16/11/2020, 17:12 - Bee: This message
16/11/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Wednesday is a maybe. Friday will be more likely
16/11/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: This Saturday shouldn't have anything to keep me busy theoretically but I'll only know when it comes
16/11/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Nooo.  Talking to you is what I was looking forward to 🙁
16/11/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're free for a call
16/11/2020, 17:26 - Bee: In 15?
16/11/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Then we'll talk
16/11/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
16/11/2020, 17:52 - Bee: Hi
16/11/2020, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
16/11/2020, 17:54 - Bee: I'll call?
16/11/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
17/11/2020, 08:36 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal! I'm in college and working on research. It's been a good day so far except for this one thing which I'll tell you about when we talk
17/11/2020, 08:36 - Bee: I hope you have a great day 😊
17/11/2020, 08:47 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! I'm glad your day is well :). I look forward to our talk
17/11/2020, 08:47 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/11/2020, 08:48 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/11/2020, 10:48 - Bee: This is not what I imagined when you told me about it
17/11/2020, 10:48 - Bee: Colored dominos! 😍
17/11/2020, 10:48 - Bee: V1 looks pretty good. The next one's must've been better
17/11/2020, 10:49 - Bee: Gimmmeeeeeee
17/11/2020, 12:04 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/11/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: What did you imagine?
17/11/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: It was! I'm sure you'll see it when the video goes up
17/11/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: Speaking of, https://www.postalbibleschool.ie/online-school-assemblies/
17/11/2020, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: Then what'll I wear 😐
17/11/2020, 12:08 - Nischal Abraham: You and your aloo bhujiya 😂. Don't you ever feel like you've had too much of that? And why is always lying down 😂
17/11/2020, 12:12 - Bee: The edges of the block letters would be sharp. But then they wouldn't fall down one after the other right
17/11/2020, 12:12 - Bee: Thanks
17/11/2020, 12:13 - Bee: I did feel like that after one month of lockdown and so I stopped for a bit. Got back to it in June
17/11/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Lying down because it's sooooo comfortable. You should try it sometime
17/11/2020, 12:31 - Nischal Abraham: My food is only eaten in the kitchen table. The only things I eat in bed is biscuits and that is sitting up watching something
17/11/2020, 13:01 - Bee: You aren't living life Nischal
17/11/2020, 13:03 - Nischal Abraham: That's how our second version ended up
17/11/2020, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: Am I dead then?
17/11/2020, 13:09 - Bee: Is the second version the final one?
17/11/2020, 13:09 - Bee: Technically, yes
17/11/2020, 13:18 - Bee: Added it to the possible list
17/11/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
17/11/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Timon had the V2 photo 😁
17/11/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: The look is final but we had to redo it at least 4 times so the exactness may differ
17/11/2020, 13:49 - Nischal Abraham: You added dying to the possible list? I mean I guess you're not wrong 😂
17/11/2020, 14:14 - Bee: This is what I had imagined. Not the different colours... Just black and white
17/11/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Looks pretty good 😁 I'm sure the video will come out splendidly
17/11/2020, 14:14 - Bee: No that's for the Things to do when we meet list
17/11/2020, 14:26 - Bee: Nischal, is it okay if I write a poem on the back of your letter?
17/11/2020, 14:26 - Bee: I really want to write it but another sheet won't fit into the envelope
17/11/2020, 14:33 - Bee: I'm writing
17/11/2020, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: For Arpitha? I don't mind
17/11/2020, 14:47 - Bee: Cool. Thanks
17/11/2020, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Done for the day. I'm free when you are
17/11/2020, 17:56 - Bee: HIIIIIIII
17/11/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I came back home around 10:30 and then was on a call with Reenee until now
17/11/2020, 17:56 - Bee: I'll take a shower and call you in 15?
17/11/2020, 17:57 - Bee: Is that okay?
17/11/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Okay 👌
17/11/2020, 18:18 - Bee: Hi
17/11/2020, 18:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
17/11/2020, 18:20 - Bee: I'll call?
17/11/2020, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
18/11/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope you're having a fun day. I got to catch up on all my sleep last night 😊
18/11/2020, 10:52 - Bee: Hey :)
18/11/2020, 10:52 - Bee: How many hours did you sleep for?
18/11/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Done with college. On my way back. I like these hours
18/11/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
18/11/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: I slept from 10:45pm to 8am
18/11/2020, 10:53 - Bee: That's 9+ hours
18/11/2020, 10:53 - Nischal Abraham: That's 9 hours I guess
18/11/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Cool
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yep 😊
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: In the train?
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Bee: What are your plans for today?
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Will you be required to go to work at all?
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Yeo
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Bee: Yep
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: Working on the things Gareth asked me to check out
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: Not exactly work. I'm just sitting in the library
18/11/2020, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: I can do things in my own time
18/11/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: What're you listening to?
18/11/2020, 10:55 - Bee: Nothing atm. Shalini is back from Gujarat. Making plans to meet with her tomorrow evening
18/11/2020, 10:55 - Bee: I was listening to Banks before
18/11/2020, 10:55 - Bee: Just got off a call with Shalini
18/11/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's cool
18/11/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Who's Banks?
18/11/2020, 10:56 - Bee: It's a song
18/11/2020, 10:56 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Banks by NEEDTOBREATHE
https://link.tospotify.com/BbiZNS6Nvbb
18/11/2020, 10:56 - Bee: This one
18/11/2020, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh haven't heard it. I'll check it out
18/11/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… You Are a Child of Mine by Mark Schultz
https://link.tospotify.com/6tn89ZaOvbb
18/11/2020, 10:57 - Bee: Listen to this one of you haven't
18/11/2020, 10:58 - Bee: Wait the songs aren't opening
18/11/2020, 10:58 - Bee: Here’s a song for you… Banks by NEEDTOBREATHE
https://link.tospotify.com/J2q9X0fOvbb

Banks
18/11/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Are they?
18/11/2020, 10:59 - Nischal Abraham: The links are working
18/11/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Okay cool
18/11/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Why is the link different
18/11/2020, 10:59 - Bee: .
18/11/2020, 10:59 - Bee: Even though it's the same song
18/11/2020, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: The first one linked to the album
18/11/2020, 11:00 - Nischal Abraham: I guess the second one is specifically to the song?
18/11/2020, 11:01 - Bee: Oh
18/11/2020, 11:01 - Bee: Yes
18/11/2020, 11:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well I just pressed play for the song. I can only listen to them on my laptop anyway. Free version doesn't allow you to select specific songs on the app
18/11/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: I like the songs! Which made me realise I haven't checked out our playlist in a while
18/11/2020, 11:10 - Bee: Oh... I got the premium a few months ago because it was a good deal. 60% off for a yearly subscription
18/11/2020, 11:10 - Bee: These two are added to the playlist
18/11/2020, 11:10 - Bee: Added the Mark Schultz one today. The first time I heard it was around 10 years ago. Sammy would sing it quite often then
18/11/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a good deal. Though my usage on the phone has been scarce in recent times
18/11/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: I just noticed
18/11/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh... That's an old song then. How was college today?
18/11/2020, 11:29 - Bee: It is. My day went well :)) got a lot of research work done. Still have a lot to do
18/11/2020, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: Nice nice... What's plans for when you're back home then?
18/11/2020, 11:44 - Bee: I'm hungry so I'll go eat something
18/11/2020, 11:44 - Bee: No other plans
18/11/2020, 11:44 - Bee: Feels like I'm wasting an evening
18/11/2020, 11:45 - Nischal Abraham: Its only wasted if you had something else to do and didn't do it. What else do you want to do?
18/11/2020, 11:59 - Bee: There's nothing urgent. But there are always things to do
18/11/2020, 11:59 - Bee: I would've gone for a walk but I got a shoebite today. So no walk
18/11/2020, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: You could just do one of the not so urgent things
18/11/2020, 12:00 - Bee: There's playing the ukulele. That's the not urgent thing
18/11/2020, 12:00 - Bee: And watching a video that Berachah sent
18/11/2020, 12:01 - Bee: So for the girls' group thing, this month the study is on Gossip. And Berachah can't do zoom meetings so she records and uploads on YouTube
18/11/2020, 12:02 - Bee: I feel like cooking. But I don't know what's there at home. I'll go check after I've finished my bowl of moong Dal.
18/11/2020, 12:02 - Bee: What do you prefer? Moong Dal or Aloo bhujia?
18/11/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: Aloo bhujiya. But I don't really mind either
18/11/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like something you could do while eating
18/11/2020, 12:07 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds nice too! But then again I'd go for the musical option most times 😂
18/11/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Of course you would 😂
18/11/2020, 12:23 - Bee: This is what I'm doing
18/11/2020, 12:23 - Bee: What are you doing?
18/11/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Well at the time you sent that message I went to the shops to get some stuff. Then came back and had some lunch
18/11/2020, 13:48 - Nischal Abraham: Now I'm back in the library again
18/11/2020, 14:49 - Bee: What are you doing in the library?
18/11/2020, 14:50 - Bee: I have a call at 9pm with my roommates from Kerala ☺️
18/11/2020, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
18/11/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! Enjoy your call ☺️
18/11/2020, 15:12 - Bee: You've decided your topic of study for the next almost 6 months then?
18/11/2020, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Researching if the topic I've chosen can be studied. Related references of Christ in the old testament
18/11/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Cool cool
18/11/2020, 15:28 - Bee: Will you be free for a call tonight?
18/11/2020, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: I will :). Got nothing else planned
18/11/2020, 16:44 - Bee: I spoke to two out of four roommates ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
18/11/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Having dinner now
18/11/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Free for a call in 20?
18/11/2020, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Like now?
18/11/2020, 17:06 - Bee: In 5?
18/11/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Cool
18/11/2020, 17:13 - Bee: Hi
18/11/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
18/11/2020, 17:14 - Bee: I'll call?
18/11/2020, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
19/11/2020, 08:17 - Bee: Hello, friend
19/11/2020, 08:27 - Bee: You are the invariant in the algorithm of my heart, friend
19/11/2020, 08:27 - Bee: Have a gooooooooood day, friend
19/11/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you!
19/11/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: That's very sweet 😊
19/11/2020, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day is going well too! You're probably already home by now
19/11/2020, 13:50 - Bee: Nope. I was with Shalini
19/11/2020, 13:50 - Bee: I'm on my way back now
19/11/2020, 13:51 - Bee: I am so dull
19/11/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Not dull
19/11/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Full
19/11/2020, 13:51 - Bee: I am full
19/11/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like a good time if you're full!
19/11/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: I'm pretty full from lunch too. Only had to hand pack 250 envelopes
19/11/2020, 16:12 - Bee: 250 done already?!
19/11/2020, 16:12 - Bee: Wow.
19/11/2020, 16:27 - Nischal Abraham: Yea so there's 1500 newsletters but some of them go to churches which would have multiple sheets in one envelope. So the total was only around 500 I think
19/11/2020, 16:27 - Nischal Abraham: The total envelopes to be packed
19/11/2020, 16:59 - Bee: 250 is a lot still
19/11/2020, 16:59 - Bee: When will you be free for a call?
19/11/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: In 20 min?
19/11/2020, 17:00 - Bee: Cool. See you :)
19/11/2020, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Tired?
19/11/2020, 17:00 - Bee: I'll be up until 11:15ish. So short call? Tired, yes
19/11/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Are you free now?
19/11/2020, 17:01 - Bee: I am
19/11/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5 min
19/11/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Alright
19/11/2020, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Hi
19/11/2020, 17:13 - Bee: I'll call?
19/11/2020, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
20/11/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope your days going well
20/11/2020, 11:07 - Bee: Hello, bb ☺️
20/11/2020, 11:07 - Bee: I'm craving cookie dough
20/11/2020, 11:07 - Bee: But I don't have chocolate at home
20/11/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: Buy some?
20/11/2020, 11:07 - Bee: I will look for an edible cookie dough recipe
20/11/2020, 11:07 - Bee: I don't want to spend money on carvings like this. I'm stingy like that
20/11/2020, 11:08 - Bee: Is it an off day for you?
20/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
20/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: So I'm trying to figure out how cloud hosting works
20/11/2020, 11:08 - Bee: Oh. Do you need an app for that?
20/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: And not enough my money with me to buy it on my way home
20/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: I'm going to have to wait for cookie dough
20/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: I just want something sweet but not too sweet
20/11/2020, 11:11 - Bee: I want to do the fishing magnets thing that you had told me about. But I'll need bottle caps for that right
20/11/2020, 11:11 - Bee: With the kids
20/11/2020, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: Cloud hosting is putting up a website on the internet
20/11/2020, 11:11 - Bee: Oh
20/11/2020, 11:11 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Metal bottle caps and paper
20/11/2020, 11:11 - Bee: I'll keep rambling. Don't let me disturb you
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Bee: Paper why?
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Bee: No magnets?
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: You're not disturbing... I'm a bit clueless so trying to find a starting point
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Bee: Okay
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: Well paper for the fishes and then you stick it to the cap
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: Magnets for the fishing pole
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: And thread
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Nischal Abraham: And sticks I guess
20/11/2020, 11:12 - Bee: Why paper?
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Bee: Oh sticks yesssssss
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: It can be cardboard... Or anything you can draw and cut out a fish from
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Bee: I've got chopsticks at home. That will work right
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Bee: I want then to have a fun time
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Whats the point of fishing without any fishes?
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Bee: The fish aren't in water?
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Bee: I thought the metal bottle caps were the fish
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: Na... The water is imaginary
20/11/2020, 11:13 - Bee: I thought I'd drop them in a tub of water with some pebbles
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: I guess that works too... You can get creative. I never really was
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Dude
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: .
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Wait you told me
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Sorry
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: Cool
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: I was going to add plastic plants too
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: But I'll have to look into the cupboard of junk for thst
20/11/2020, 11:14 - Bee: That*
20/11/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: It can be cardboard... Or anything you can draw and cut out a fish from
20/11/2020, 11:15 - Bee: Okay
20/11/2020, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: It can be cardboard... Or anything you can draw and cut out a fish from

20/11/2020, 11:16 - Bee: Dude
20/11/2020, 11:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/11/2020, 11:16 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just making sure you have your answer... Just in case you wondered why paper
20/11/2020, 11:17 - Bee: How considerate
20/11/2020, 11:17 - Bee: Many thanks
20/11/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: You're plenty welcome 😁
20/11/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: Are you on your way back home already?
20/11/2020, 11:19 - Bee: I am. About to reach Airoli. Which is the stop before Thane
20/11/2020, 11:21 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool... Done early today?
20/11/2020, 11:24 - Bee: Not really. Been leaving college at 4 that last few days
20/11/2020, 11:24 - Bee: What did you eat for breakfast?
20/11/2020, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: Toast and eggs again. What did you have for lunch?
20/11/2020, 11:28 - Bee: I ate dal, rice, pickle, and bhurji
20/11/2020, 11:28 - Bee: Abisha brought a yummy paneer gravy thing which I had too
20/11/2020, 11:30 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that sounds really good 😋
20/11/2020, 11:33 - Bee: Thanks dude
20/11/2020, 11:33 - Bee: I want something sweet now
20/11/2020, 11:33 - Bee: I'll go home and check what's there
20/11/2020, 11:34 - Nischal Abraham: Have a lovely evening with the kids Bee! No sisters meeting today?
20/11/2020, 11:36 - Bee: No sisters meeting today. We had it last week. We'll have it next week
20/11/2020, 11:36 - Bee: I will have a lovely evening!!!! I just know it
20/11/2020, 11:42 - Bee: https://parivahan.gov.in/rcdlstatus/?pur_cd=101
Yayyyyyyyyyy
20/11/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Wait but you don't have my driver's license number
20/11/2020, 11:43 - Bee: It's okay. Don't open the link
20/11/2020, 11:46 - Nischal Abraham: I don't get it. Explain?
20/11/2020, 11:55 - Bee: I got a message saying my driver's license is approved and is on its way. The message also had the link that I sent and my driver's license number. Once you open the link, it asks for my driver's license number and my birthdate. And once I submit those, it shows the approval page for my driver's license
20/11/2020, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! Drivers license coming soon 😁
20/11/2020, 13:36 - Bee: <Media omitted>
20/11/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hey I won't be able to join a call tonight. At Timon's place
20/11/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Okay
20/11/2020, 17:54 - Bee: I had a good day. 😊
20/11/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Goodn!
20/11/2020, 17:54 - Bee: Goodnight!*
20/11/2020, 17:55 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight! Hope you didn't stay up too long for me
20/11/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Don't worry about it. Hasn't been too long
21/11/2020, 03:33 - Bee: Good morning! I hope you have a great day 😊
21/11/2020, 09:32 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon! Hope your day's going well
21/11/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: I may not be free for a call in the evening. But I'm free for the rest of the day anytime so let me know if that works for you in any way
21/11/2020, 10:50 - Bee: Oh :(
21/11/2020, 10:50 - Bee: I'm meeting Julie aunty straight from college and dinner is at Jessy moushi's tonight :(
21/11/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice! Sounds like a busy day for you
21/11/2020, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: We can talk tomorrow then. How was your day at college today?
21/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: Aren't you spending your day at Gareth's tomorrow?
21/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: I had a busy day. I want to take a nap
21/11/2020, 11:09 - Bee: How's your day going?
21/11/2020, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes. I forgot about that
21/11/2020, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: Woke up at 9:30 since I didn't keep an alarm. Had breakfast and played some violin. Will be calling Daniel Raghu in a minute. So far it's been pretty good ☺️
21/11/2020, 11:43 - Bee: You slept in!
21/11/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Enjoy your call 😊
21/11/2020, 11:55 - Nischal Abraham: Call done!
21/11/2020, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: I did. Slept last night at 1:30. We were over at Timon's place for a while
21/11/2020, 11:56 - Nischal Abraham: When are you going to Juliet aunty's place?
21/11/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Just got home. I'll take a shower and leave
21/11/2020, 12:45 - Bee: Can I call for 5 minutes?
21/11/2020, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'm on a call with parents rn
21/11/2020, 12:48 - Bee: Okay
21/11/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know if you have 5 min before you head off for dinner
21/11/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Yes nana. I will
21/11/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I wasn't free earlier 🙁
21/11/2020, 13:13 - Bee: I'm sorry I haven't and won't be free
21/11/2020, 13:15 - Bee: I miss you man
21/11/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Our calls seem like a workday thing. Not available on the weekends 😂
21/11/2020, 13:15 - Nischal Abraham: Which is ironic. Shouldn't it be the opposite!?
21/11/2020, 13:18 - Bee: 😂
21/11/2020, 13:19 - Bee: Work days may not work either. I think I'm not getting enough sleep. After sleeping well during lockdown, 6 hours doesn't feel like enough
21/11/2020, 13:19 - Nischal Abraham: That's understandable. 7 isn't enough for me
21/11/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: I think we just need shorter calls
21/11/2020, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'd rather talk more often than wait a long while if I'm being honest
21/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: Hi
21/11/2020, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
21/11/2020, 14:30 - Bee: I'd want long calls everyday but I'll take the former over the latter
21/11/2020, 14:30 - Bee: I'll call?
21/11/2020, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
21/11/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Dinner was amazing. I'm so full and drowsy
21/11/2020, 17:39 - Bee: I hope you're having a good time with the guys. Playing Age of empires maybe
21/11/2020, 17:39 - Bee: Goodnight (for when you go to sleep), Nischal. 😊
21/11/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! A full dinner sounds like a good time 😊. Especially when you're not wearing jeans. I had a fun time with Timon. Alex didn't join us
21/11/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Will be heading to Gareth's for Chinese dinner. And then there's Bible reading later tonight
21/11/2020, 21:32 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee... Hope you have a lovely time at worship tomorrow! Praying for you always 😊
22/11/2020, 07:13 - Bee: Hi Nischal 😊
22/11/2020, 07:13 - Bee: Chinese takeaway? I like all the fellowship you're enjoying 😊
22/11/2020, 07:14 - Bee: It's so cold where you are!!! Add 30° to your temperature and you'll get mine
22/11/2020, 07:14 - Bee: Worship went alright. I was a little distracted. I didn't sleep well last night. I kept waking up
22/11/2020, 07:15 - Bee: Praying you have a fruitful time 😊
22/11/2020, 07:15 - Bee: And a fun day ahead!
22/11/2020, 07:19 - Nischal Abraham: I like it too!
22/11/2020, 07:20 - Nischal Abraham: I had to check what the temp was. Didn't realise it had dropped so low today. Well the room heater is doing its job well
22/11/2020, 07:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Hope you're alright. What's your plans for the rest of the day?
22/11/2020, 07:21 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee!
22/11/2020, 07:23 - Nischal Abraham: I felt exhausted yesterday throughout the day for some reason. Maybe sleeping in just made me more tired? Well either way I should've turned off my WiFi last night but forgot to 😂
22/11/2020, 07:23 - Nischal Abraham: But I should be up regardless. Hope the rest of your day is well Bee! Maybe enjoy a nap in the afternoon
22/11/2020, 07:23 - Bee: DID MY MESSAGES WAKE YOU UP?!?!
22/11/2020, 07:24 - Bee: I have research stuff to do. I want to go for a walk in the evening... Nothing else planned
22/11/2020, 07:24 - Nischal Abraham: The alarm woke me up. The messages buzzed before my snooze did though
22/11/2020, 07:24 - Bee: Hmm... Maybe. Because you never sleep in
22/11/2020, 07:24 - Bee: What men
22/11/2020, 07:24 - Bee: Y u no turn WiFi off
22/11/2020, 07:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'd rather your voice wake me up in the morning
22/11/2020, 07:25 - Bee: I will send you a recording of me screaming. Set it as your alarm tone
22/11/2020, 07:25 - Nischal Abraham: Too tired to have noticed? Idk I only remembered to enable the alarm again. Didn't look at the WiFi
22/11/2020, 07:25 - Bee: Ahh
22/11/2020, 07:26 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds interesting 😂
22/11/2020, 07:26 - Bee: I'm on it
22/11/2020, 07:26 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be tough explaining that one when I am sleeping over at someone else's or out for camps
22/11/2020, 07:27 - Bee: They'll thank me for waking them up
22/11/2020, 07:27 - Nischal Abraham: Well anywho. I'll talk to you later! Praying your research stuff progresses well
22/11/2020, 07:28 - Bee: Thanks nana. Byyee
22/11/2020, 15:10 - Bee: Hey, bb! My day has been going good so far. We had khichdi for lunch which was a little hard because aren't Sundays for special food? After that I napped a bit and worked on research stuff a lot. Went out with the bros for roadside junk food after. Everything was delicious. Now it's time for my loooooonnnggg bath
22/11/2020, 15:11 - Bee: No need to reply
22/11/2020, 15:11 - Bee: Byyyeeee
22/11/2020, 15:14 - Bee: Also, I miss you
22/11/2020, 15:14 - Bee: Byyyeeeeee
22/11/2020, 17:34 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal. 😊
22/11/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you had a fun day!
22/11/2020, 20:21 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too Bee 🙁
22/11/2020, 20:22 - Nischal Abraham: I had a lovely day too! Lunch at Gareth's place and then Phil and Carly invited us for a bike ride. So it was Timon, me and them. My legs were killing me by the end of it
22/11/2020, 20:22 - Nischal Abraham: It's been forever since I've exerted at all physically
22/11/2020, 20:23 - Nischal Abraham: Then we played more board games. I finally got to play Settlers of Catan!! It's such a fun game. And we played another card game called Rook
23/11/2020, 08:45 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! Hope your day has been splendid 😊. I fell asleep at 10 and woke up at 7:50. Clearly exhausted from yesterday's cycling
23/11/2020, 08:45 - Nischal Abraham: And a nice shower and changing the bed sheets ☺️. Oh it was the perfect setting to sleep long hours
23/11/2020, 08:46 - Nischal Abraham: Praying the rest of your day goes well! Looking forward to talking to you if possible. I still can't confirm I'll be free but until something comes up I should be free from 10:30pm
23/11/2020, 08:46 - Nischal Abraham: Or else we could sneak in a call during my lunch break. Well whichever suits you better
23/11/2020, 10:43 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!!!!!
23/11/2020, 10:43 - Bee: I did
23/11/2020, 10:44 - Bee: Phil and Carly are new names
23/11/2020, 10:44 - Bee: Settlers of Catan is your fav game even tho you haven't played it? Until yesterday, that is
23/11/2020, 10:45 - Bee: No I think it's a game you want to own. And not your favourite game
23/11/2020, 10:45 - Bee: My day has been alright. Didn't have much to do today because we finished everything yesterday
23/11/2020, 10:45 - Bee: 10 hours of sleep 😮 I slept well too. I got 8 hours of sleep
23/11/2020, 10:46 - Bee: Either are fine by me. I'm free now and until I go to bed
23/11/2020, 10:47 - Bee: Is your lunch break in 2ish hours?
23/11/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Also, I wore my glasses full time today!
23/11/2020, 10:53 - Bee: Wearing them now in the train too 😁
23/11/2020, 10:54 - Bee: <Media omitted>
23/11/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I met them for the first time during new year's when I came to Cavan with Daniel
23/11/2020, 11:06 - Nischal Abraham: This is accurate
23/11/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! Though when you say finished everything do you mean there's no more to be done forever or for now?
23/11/2020, 11:07 - Nischal Abraham: And wasn't your meeting with your teacher going to happen today? How did it go?
23/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: It will be in 1.5ish hours from now
23/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice!
23/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome!
23/11/2020, 11:08 - Nischal Abraham: Is that the medical mask with the metal strip to keep the nose part closed?
23/11/2020, 11:55 - Bee: For now. We've submitted everything we were supposed to. Now we wait for corrections
23/11/2020, 11:56 - Bee: She didn't come today 😩 she's coming tomorrow onwards
23/11/2020, 11:56 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
23/11/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Yes. Maybe that's why the glasses aren't fogging up. I should stitch the metal part into my cloth mask
23/11/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Hi Nischal. I'm going out for a bit with papa... I'll be back in an hour. Your lunch break will be over by then, right? Maybe at 10:30 if you're free then?
23/11/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: At 10:30 sounds lovely. My lunch break would be over in an hour. Sorry I couldn't be free earlier I had to go and buy stuff
23/11/2020, 13:12 - Bee: Don't be sorry. See you at 10:30 😊
23/11/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: Praying it goes well
23/11/2020, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: That would be really helpful I'm sure. But wouldn't it be an issue to wash the mask then?
23/11/2020, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: I look forward to it. I'll let you know if I finish up earlier than that. It's possible I might today since it's been a quiet day
23/11/2020, 16:09 - Bee: True. 😩
23/11/2020, 16:13 - Bee: Cool. Anytime is fine by me
23/11/2020, 16:49 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
23/11/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Hi!!!
23/11/2020, 16:58 - Bee: Give me 5 minutes
23/11/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
23/11/2020, 16:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free whenever you are
23/11/2020, 17:00 - Bee: Hi
23/11/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
23/11/2020, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
23/11/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Nischal!!!! I forgot to tell you this one thing I wanted to.
23/11/2020, 18:46 - Bee: When I sent this, I didn't mean shirtless photos of me. I wouldn't.
23/11/2020, 18:46 - Bee: That's all
23/11/2020, 18:46 - Bee: Byee
23/11/2020, 18:46 - Bee: I didn't want to wait until Wednesday to tell you and that's why text message
23/11/2020, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: I know Debby 😶. It was a tasteless joke by me. Don't read into it
23/11/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry if that's been bothering you. I'd never think you'd have meant you at all. I'll just have to be more mindful of things I rile you up about
23/11/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Is it tasteless because I clarified?
23/11/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Thank you. I would've told you much sooner but I wasn't sure if it was me overthinking
23/11/2020, 19:00 - Bee: I'm sorry that I'm being overly sensitive
23/11/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Not at all Bee 😊
23/11/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: There's nothing to apologise for. If you are being overly sensitive I'll make sure you know
23/11/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Thank you, Nischal.
23/11/2020, 19:07 - Bee: I'm sorry that you have to deal with all of this. One day such things won't bother me anymore.
24/11/2020, 09:37 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! I've been praying for your meeting with the teacher. Hope it went well
24/11/2020, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy the rest of your day! I'm sure it'll be a fun time with the other 3 😁
24/11/2020, 11:27 - Bee: Hey!
24/11/2020, 11:27 - Bee: It went well. We might finish this week
24/11/2020, 11:27 - Bee: I hope you have a great day too 😊
24/11/2020, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that's awesome!!
24/11/2020, 14:08 - Bee: It is!!!
24/11/2020, 14:08 - Bee: How's your day going?
24/11/2020, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: Been well so far. I made some chicken rice last night so had those leftovers for lunch today
24/11/2020, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: But my rice reserves are slowly falling short... I need to find a place that sells more rice soon. Today's a very rainy day outside
24/11/2020, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: You'd like looking at it... I doubt you'd like being in it though
24/11/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Looks like I might not be going for a walk today. The rains don't seem to be stopping. If you're free later we could get on a call
24/11/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Would Timon know where to find rice?
24/11/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Is this the SIngaporean chicken rice?
24/11/2020, 16:13 - Bee: I know I won't. Being outside in 25° weather in the rain is one thing. But 6°? No, thank you
24/11/2020, 16:14 - Bee: I don't know if I'll be free...I have to make corrections cause we need to submit the revised copy first thing tomorrow morning
24/11/2020, 16:14 - Bee: Research work
24/11/2020, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: That's a good shout. I could check with him
24/11/2020, 16:22 - Nischal Abraham: Garlic chicken rice
24/11/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. But you'll have a jacket on!
24/11/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's alright. We can talk tomorrow 😊. Did you meet with the peeps then?
24/11/2020, 16:39 - Bee: I'll need at least 2 jackets and 3 pairs of pants
24/11/2020, 16:39 - Bee: I did!
24/11/2020, 16:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
24/11/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yay you're wearing your glasses! And all the colourful masks are nice 😁. Almost makes me wish I was there
24/11/2020, 18:16 - Bee: I am! The nose clip prevents it from fogging which I like
24/11/2020, 18:17 - Bee: Done with research work. For tomorrow at least
24/11/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Hey! How's your day been?
24/11/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Did you have a holiday today? Or were you working?
24/11/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Has it stopped raining?
24/11/2020, 18:37 - Bee: My weather app shows that it's still raining
24/11/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Today was a very busy day. Though I did finish up by 5. Had to step out in the rain to post some stuff
24/11/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: It probably is still raining
24/11/2020, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! What else do you have planned for tomorrow?
24/11/2020, 18:54 - Bee: Oh. Sorting through stacks of papers? Marking papers?
24/11/2020, 18:54 - Bee: How did your meeting go?
24/11/2020, 18:54 - Nischal Abraham: Today was putting stickers and labels on papers
24/11/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: Went well... Decided on options for the moodle website. I'm planning on buying a personal website just to get practice on how to go about setting up one
24/11/2020, 18:55 - Bee: College and then a call with Merin. No other plans. Merin called today but I was too occupied and asked her if I could call back tomorrow
24/11/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Will the URL be your name?
24/11/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Will it be your website for life?
24/11/2020, 18:56 - Bee: What are you doing now?
24/11/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
24/11/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know what it'll be a website for
24/11/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Not a whole lot... I have dinner ready so don't need to worry about it
24/11/2020, 18:57 - Bee: But you won't buy another one ever right
24/11/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Chicken rice leftovers?
24/11/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Its a yearly charge for the website
24/11/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Oh
24/11/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: Nope that was lunch. I made a chicken/carrot/onion side dish thingy to go with bread
24/11/2020, 18:58 - Bee: With oyster sauce?
24/11/2020, 18:58 - Bee: Fancy food man
24/11/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: I bought too much chicken last night so had to make something else other than the rice with it
24/11/2020, 18:59 - Nischal Abraham: That went really well with the rice
24/11/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Chicken soup?
24/11/2020, 18:59 - Bee: Have you finished all your chicken?
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Just the sauce and rice?
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Not soup. This
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Something to try next
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Bee: Cool
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Bee: I'm going to go to sleep now
24/11/2020, 19:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... I'll need more stuff for it but I can try next time
24/11/2020, 19:01 - Bee: It'll be lovely for a cold night
24/11/2020, 19:01 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. 😊
24/11/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
24/11/2020, 19:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a lovely day tomorrow 😊
25/11/2020, 06:12 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal
25/11/2020, 06:13 - Bee: I hope you have a lovely day too 😊
25/11/2020, 07:36 - Bee: You're in 1° weather. How 😩
25/11/2020, 08:37 - Nischal Abraham: It's not the first time. And the house is warmer than the outside. Start the day with warm water+lemon+honey and I'm good
25/11/2020, 09:03 - Nischal Abraham: I have an off day from PBS today. Let me know if you're free for a call anytime
25/11/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Well I say off day but it'd be more accurate to say different work day I guess. Either way I can take out time in between. Although I will be busy for around 20 min from 11:40 to 12pm
25/11/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: Other than that it should be fine
25/11/2020, 11:54 - Bee: Hi!!!!!
25/11/2020, 11:54 - Bee: I'm still in college
25/11/2020, 11:54 - Bee: Will be leaving in 30 minutes
25/11/2020, 11:55 - Bee: We're close to finishing our corrections. Final ones hopefully
25/11/2020, 11:55 - Bee: Is tonight okay?
25/11/2020, 11:55 - Bee: I'll be home only by 8... And then there's the call with Merin
25/11/2020, 11:56 - Bee: I'm sorry about the dew replies...
25/11/2020, 11:56 - Bee: Been quite busy
25/11/2020, 11:59 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God. Love to hear it 😊
25/11/2020, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: It should be. Only if it's okay with you too
25/11/2020, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: Don't worry about replying. I'll just keep sending you messages as the day goes on. You do what you need to do!
25/11/2020, 13:06 - Bee: It will have to be a short call if it's okay... I've got stuff to do for tomorrow 😔
25/11/2020, 13:06 - Bee: I'm in the train now. I'm starving even though I just had a chicken roll
25/11/2020, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: Chicken roll for snack? or for lunch?
25/11/2020, 13:07 - Bee: For snack
25/11/2020, 13:07 - Bee: I had chapattis and beans vegetable for lunch
25/11/2020, 13:07 - Bee: What's for your lunch? Have you eaten yet?
25/11/2020, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't eaten yet. But it'll be my chicken preparation for lunch
25/11/2020, 13:08 - Bee: There's a 5-6ish year old sitting in front of my. By the window. And the wonder and awe in her eyes is refreshing. Train journeys are exciting
25/11/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Garlic chicken?
25/11/2020, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Nope the other one
25/11/2020, 13:09 - Bee: A tomato based chicken gravy?
25/11/2020, 13:09 - Bee: Noodles with chicken?
25/11/2020, 13:09 - Bee: What's the other one?
25/11/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: .
25/11/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: I don't have names for these Bee... I just made with whatever I had in the fridge
25/11/2020, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Added some capsicum also to it
25/11/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Ahh. Cool cool
25/11/2020, 13:12 - Bee: You should give it a name
25/11/2020, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: "My mom's boiled chicken recipe that works with any vegetable alternative"
25/11/2020, 13:16 - Nischal Abraham: There! I was missing potatoes though... So it ended up being more like gravy since there was no potatoes to absorb the water
25/11/2020, 13:23 - Bee: Sounds good. Now whenever you make your mom's boiled chicken recipe that works with any vegetable alternative, I'll know that you've made your mom's boiled chicken recipe that works with any vegetable alternative. See easy
25/11/2020, 13:23 - Bee: That's good right? To eat with rice
25/11/2020, 13:23 - Bee: How many portions of rice do you have remaining?
25/11/2020, 13:27 - Nischal Abraham: Probably enough to make for 3 more meals. And 0.5 meal made in the fridge that I'll probably use for fried rice down the line
25/11/2020, 13:33 - Bee: Ahh. Have you asked Timin yet?
25/11/2020, 13:33 - Bee: No
25/11/2020, 13:33 - Bee: Timon*
25/11/2020, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. He's up north this week and I'll only see him on the weekend now
25/11/2020, 13:41 - Bee: Oh. Cool
25/11/2020, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Call with Merin now?
25/11/2020, 14:40 - Bee: Nope. The call is postponed to tomorrow
25/11/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Research work then?
25/11/2020, 15:01 - Bee: Haven't started yet. Can't find the motivation. I need to take a shower before
25/11/2020, 15:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm. What do you plan to get completed today?
25/11/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Everything
25/11/2020, 15:35 - Bee: There's a lot of editing to be done
25/11/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Done with shower. Going to eat dinner and sit right away
25/11/2020, 15:35 - Bee: What's up?
25/11/2020, 15:36 - Nischal Abraham: Feeling the drain of a cold lazy afternoon
25/11/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: But I don't want to nap as it'll just ruin my night sleep
25/11/2020, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! If you're busy for a call it's okay Bee. We can talk another day 😊
25/11/2020, 16:49 - Bee: The call seems less likely to happen with each passing minute :(
25/11/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: It's okay. Focus on your work... Hope you finish what you need to do 😊
25/11/2020, 18:10 - Bee: *Dear God* 
I think I'm too clingy. I know that we must have things going on in our lives that aren't consumed by our relationship, but it hurts when I think about it. I feel that ache when Nischal mentions plans which get in the way of our call. He has a great balance of things inside and outside this relationship. I don't. I feel like I'm consumed. By this relationship. And I wish he'd be like that too but I know it's not healthy. Where do I go from here? The only book I want to read right now is TMoM. But he's got a list of books to read which isn't that one. The only person I want to talk to (most of the time) is him. But he's got so many plans he wants to be a part of. I know I'm in the wrong here. But I don't know where to go from here. I make myself believe that he doesn't care for me enough to want to spend time with me. I feel like I'm more invested in this relationship than he is. A tiny part of me says that it isn't true. But I want to believe the much greater part of me that tells me it is. Don't I trust him enough? He mentioned something along those lines yesterday... That I don't trust him enough. We were talking about the Berachah-Daniel thing and how I wouldn't have told him about it had he been here. He must have said it jokingly but it hit. The not trusting him part. I don't even know if I should tell him all of this. Now I'm second guessing everything that I should or should not be telling him. Why am I so difficult, God? Why is my head so complicated. Why can't I be an easier personto deal with? He's been nothing but good to me. Why am I being like this?
Please help me, Father. I don't know where to go.
25/11/2020, 18:49 - Bee: I hope you're sitting with a book
25/11/2020, 18:49 - Bee: And a pen
25/11/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I wrote a bit more than I thought I would. So you can look forward to another monologue by me on our next call (as if that hasn't happened before 😂)
25/11/2020, 19:59 - Bee: Has it? I think this is gonna be your first monologue
25/11/2020, 22:36 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
25/11/2020, 22:51 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Hope you managed to finish what you needed to
25/11/2020, 22:51 - Bee: Havent finished yet :(
25/11/2020, 22:52 - Nischal Abraham: More to be done on your end?
25/11/2020, 22:53 - Bee: Yes. The final stuff. Tijy is up with me
25/11/2020, 22:54 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you finish and get some sleep Bee. I'm up with you too 😂
25/11/2020, 22:55 - Bee: 😂
25/11/2020, 22:55 - Bee: You'd be up anyway
25/11/2020, 22:56 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's nearing even my bedtime
25/11/2020, 23:00 - Bee: Then go sleep
25/11/2020, 23:00 - Bee: What are you doing?
25/11/2020, 23:00 - Nischal Abraham: No no... I'm up with you. Watching random YT videos
25/11/2020, 23:00 - Nischal Abraham: Can I help?
25/11/2020, 23:01 - Bee: Work tomorrow?
25/11/2020, 23:01 - Bee: I wish. But no...
25/11/2020, 23:01 - Bee: Thanks man
25/11/2020, 23:03 - Nischal Abraham: There will be work tomorrow
25/11/2020, 23:03 - Nischal Abraham: But I'll be up for at least an hour
26/11/2020, 00:00 - Bee: This message was deleted
26/11/2020, 00:01 - Bee: Time for you to sleep no
26/11/2020, 00:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'll head to bed. Got a lot more to go for you?
26/11/2020, 00:01 - Bee: Nope. 5 minutes more
26/11/2020, 00:01 - Bee: Goodnight nana :))
26/11/2020, 00:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yay! Let me know when you're through :)
26/11/2020, 00:07 - Bee: Done. Off to bed 😊
26/11/2020, 00:07 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo!!
26/11/2020, 00:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm off to bed too. You'll get so little sleep :(
26/11/2020, 00:08 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!!! I hope your day is well tomorrow... Praying for you always
26/11/2020, 00:08 - Bee: I'll go late tomorrow
26/11/2020, 00:08 - Bee: Thank you. :)
26/11/2020, 00:08 - Bee: I'm praying for you too
26/11/2020, 00:08 - Bee: Byyeeee
26/11/2020, 00:09 - Nischal Abraham: Byee
26/11/2020, 12:05 - Nischal Abraham: Good evening Bee! How did it go?
26/11/2020, 13:43 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
26/11/2020, 13:44 - Bee: Really well. We got some more corrections but they're not much. No need to stay up tonight 🤩

26/11/2020, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! How much did you get to sleep in the end?
26/11/2020, 14:22 - Nischal Abraham: It's been going well. It's looking like it'll be a busy few days ahead now. Plenty of tasks on the list of things to get done
26/11/2020, 14:23 - Nischal Abraham: Just the 1 from yesterday. I should get 2 more done today
26/11/2020, 16:09 - Bee: I slept for 3 hours. Heading to bed now
26/11/2020, 16:09 - Bee: Can we talk tomorrow night if you're free?
26/11/2020, 16:10 - Bee: Busy how? Tell me when we talk!
26/11/2020, 16:10 - Bee: How's it going?
26/11/2020, 16:10 - Bee: I'm going to get the sweetest sleep tonight
26/11/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Praying for you, bb.
26/11/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Bye!
26/11/2020, 16:11 - Bee: 🤗
26/11/2020, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'm sure you're already asleep. We can definitely talk later 😊. Whether that's tomorrow depends on what happens tomorrow cause I don't know what's in store 😂
27/11/2020, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! How was the night?
27/11/2020, 14:28 - Bee: Hi!!!!!
27/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: Just left from college. Still haven't finished 😔 we keep getting new corrections 😫🤯
27/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: But we're close.
27/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: I don't have to go tomorrow and Monday
27/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: Lovely night of sleep man. I slept for 10 hours
27/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: How's your day going.
27/11/2020, 14:29 - Bee: ?*
27/11/2020, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: On your way back home?
27/11/2020, 14:30 - Bee: Yep
27/11/2020, 14:30 - Bee: I missed sisters' meeting and the extended fam meeting

27/11/2020, 14:31 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! It'll all be over soon
27/11/2020, 14:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'm setting up table quizzes for SHED tomorrow. My brain is not functioning well today
27/11/2020, 14:33 - Nischal Abraham: Is the train crowded?
27/11/2020, 14:34 - Bee: Nope
27/11/2020, 14:34 - Bee: What's a table quiz?
27/11/2020, 15:53 - Bee: There's pav bhaji!!!!!!!!!!
27/11/2020, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Is that food you hate?
27/11/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: Also it looks like a call tonight won't be possible. SHED discussion will be happening in some time so it's probably best to just talk tomorrow
27/11/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: You can enjoy long sleep another night 😁
27/11/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Nope. It's food I like
27/11/2020, 17:19 - Bee: And I'll be well rested for our call tomorrow 😊

28/11/2020, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: Did you sleep in again?
28/11/2020, 08:55 - Bee: Is sleeping until 8 considered to be sleeping in?
28/11/2020, 08:55 - Bee: Spontaneously woke up at 8
28/11/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: I'd consider it sleeping in if I slept early the last night
28/11/2020, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: What're you upto?
28/11/2020, 08:57 - Bee: I did sleep early

28/11/2020, 09:03 - Bee: You could've made french toast
28/11/2020, 09:03 - Bee: Not today then
28/11/2020, 09:03 - Nischal Abraham: The bread isn't toastable
28/11/2020, 09:03 - Bee: Bread dipped in a mixture of eggs, sugar, milk, and then toasted on a pan
28/11/2020, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>

01/12/2020, 17:20 - Bee: Admit it man

01/12/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Do you have any ideas?
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Admit what?
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Bee: What we can do for her
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Bee: That you did it faster today
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: I was going to ask you this 😂
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Bee: Think about it okay
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Bee: I asked you first
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have any ideas for Ruth's birthday?
01/12/2020, 17:21 - Bee: I was thinking that me going to Pune would be her present
01/12/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! What're you taking with you?
01/12/2020, 17:22 - Bee: Reenee and I got a planner for her. We're going to write letters and mail it with the planner this week

01/12/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Or I can make a card and write your name in it
01/12/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Of course she'd know your haven't made it
01/12/2020, 17:23 - Bee: Or
01/12/2020, 17:24 - Bee: You can check if Ireland to India posts are open? I doubt it but you can check
01/12/2020, 17:24 - Bee: You can mail her a handwritten letter
01/12/2020, 17:24 - Bee: Ruth
01/12/2020, 17:24 - Bee: Still clueless about Nidhi
01/12/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: We could send Nidhi a tooth and a note saying here's your lost wisdom 😂
01/12/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Where will we find a tooth?
01/12/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: I could
01/12/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have extras?
01/12/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Nope. Unless I take it my wisdom teeth
01/12/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: I can check with the post office. Need to get familiar with it anyway

01/12/2020, 17:26 - Bee: Out*
01/12/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Okay jokes aside. I don't have any ideas now. And I'm not really the idea man. I'll ask Becky and see what she thinks

01/12/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Okay

01/12/2020, 17:31 - Bee: 😌
02/12/2020, 03:22 - Bee: What about a video? Like the one for my birthday. I'll need to get in touch with everyone now if we plan on doing that
02/12/2020, 09:26 - Nischal Abraham: A video would be nice as it involves everyone. I've never been a part of planning committee for asking people to send videos so you'll know better on the time it takes to get replies on that
02/12/2020, 13:37 - Bee: Hi bb
02/12/2020, 13:37 - Bee: Been a busy day

02/12/2020, 13:43 - Bee: Meana
02/12/2020, 13:43 - Bee: Means*
02/12/2020, 13:43 - Bee: How are you, my dearest bb?

02/12/2020, 17:28 - Bee: Norah gets chattier by the day
02/12/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Norah is up so late 😮
02/12/2020, 17:28 - Bee: This was more of a Ruth call
02/12/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Nope. She was there for the first 10 minutes

04/12/2020, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I didn't notice it was 9 already. Have fun making rasam!
04/12/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Rasam was a hit
04/12/2020, 16:44 - Bee: And so easy to make
04/12/2020, 16:44 - Bee: There was some leftover Dal which I added
04/12/2020, 16:44 - Bee: Have you left yet!
04/12/2020, 16:44 - Bee: ?*

04/12/2020, 17:10 - Bee: I just found out that one of my friends from Kerala is pregnant. Got married 2ish years ago
04/12/2020, 17:10 - Bee: And pregnant!!!!!!

04/12/2020, 17:31 - Bee: What are you gonna do until then?
04/12/2020, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: Well Gareth just messaged saying he can pick me up in 15 min
04/12/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure I can pass 15 min by. What are you upto?
04/12/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Was on a call with Reenee to discuss about Sunday's family hour
04/12/2020, 17:33 - Bee: We're playing a game
04/12/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Nothing rn
04/12/2020, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! First Sunday!!! Are you 2 games coordinators now 😂. So what'll you be playing?
04/12/2020, 17:35 - Bee: For this Sunday yes. I don't know if there's a name for it
04/12/2020, 17:35 - Bee: But it has to do with advertising
04/12/2020, 17:36 - Bee: Dividing everyone into breakout rooms (6ish screens in each room) for a duration of 10 minutes where each group will be given an object from the Bible (the jawbone that Samson used, or Jacob's pillow rock) and each group has to prepare an advertisement kinda skit where they have to sell the product
04/12/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Then breakout rooms will end and they have to perform those slots I'm front of everyone
04/12/2020, 17:37 - Bee: There are judges
04/12/2020, 17:37 - Bee: Patti and Lydia aunty most probably
04/12/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds fun! Did you come up with the idea?
04/12/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Nope. Reenee did
04/12/2020, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: So smart she is
04/12/2020, 17:43 - Bee: That she is
04/12/2020, 17:43 - Bee: My friend no
04/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Well I'll talk later! Hope you have a restful night and a wonderful day tomorrow!!
04/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be cycling?
04/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Nope. Going for a walk with Reenee
04/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Bye!
04/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Enjoy your time there 😊
04/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your walk then 😊

04/12/2020, 17:50 - Bee: 🤗
05/12/2020, 08:25 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee!! I wake in a new bed and it's a cold morning but I slept very very well
05/12/2020, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: I think I was dreaming all night till my alarm woke me up 😂
05/12/2020, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your walk was a great time. And everything else you have planned for the day going on well too. Is there more planning to be done for Family Hour tomorrow?
05/12/2020, 09:38 - Bee: <Media omitted>
05/12/2020, 09:45 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!
05/12/2020, 09:45 - Bee: 😂
05/12/2020, 09:45 - Bee: Like the guy in the video I sent on Instagram?
05/12/2020, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: There was dream related video on insta you sent me?
05/12/2020, 09:47 - Bee: A while ago yes
05/12/2020, 09:47 - Bee: I'll send it again later
05/12/2020, 09:49 - Bee: The walk was nice
05/12/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. I enjoy all the new ones you send me 😁
05/12/2020, 11:10 - Bee: Morning walk done. Was about to start cleaning one of my book shelves when Prachi Didi called to ask if I could babysit
05/12/2020, 11:10 - Bee: So here I am now
05/12/2020, 11:11 - Bee: And once I'm here, kids don't allow me to leave until after dinner time
05/12/2020, 11:11 - Bee: So I'll be here for a while
05/12/2020, 11:11 - Bee: How's your day going?
05/12/2020, 11:11 - Bee: Spoke to Rufus? Parents?
05/12/2020, 11:13 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome! See how you're provided with things to do. And things you'd love to do at that 😊
05/12/2020, 11:14 - Nischal Abraham: It's been well. Timon and I are in the Front room and he's typing away about his testimony for a talk he has to give
05/12/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: I got some reading done. Very motivating just to have someone else working as well
05/12/2020, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: Neither yet. I'll speak to Rufus at 2:30. And I'm planning on calling my parents in 15 min cause that's usually when they'll be up from an afternoon nap
05/12/2020, 11:17 - Nischal Abraham: It's a bright day out today so good for Gareth and his garage building work 😊. If it stays sunny it's a good day for video shooting too
05/12/2020, 11:18 - Nischal Abraham: I've started thinking in these terms a lot with the weather 😂. It's very unpredictable here so you have to take every opportunity you get
05/12/2020, 11:23 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope you enjoy your time with the kids! I'm not sure if I'll be free for a call today with you :(
05/12/2020, 11:37 - Bee: Yep. I'm exhausted already 😂 thank goodness it's their TV time now
05/12/2020, 11:37 - Bee: What have you been reading?
05/12/2020, 11:38 - Bee: That's great. Having company makes a difference
05/12/2020, 11:38 - Bee: Tell them I say hi!
05/12/2020, 11:38 - Bee: 😂
05/12/2020, 11:38 - Bee: Thane has predictable weather. Come
05/12/2020, 11:39 - Bee: We'll talk on Monday. :)
05/12/2020, 11:39 - Nischal Abraham: Beginning at Moses, Michael P.V. Barrett
05/12/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Just got back home
05/12/2020, 15:37 - Bee: I didn't do any of the things I planned on doing
05/12/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Why did I even plan and make a list 😂
05/12/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Life is funny
05/12/2020, 15:37 - Bee: Hope your day is going well 😊
05/12/2020, 17:00 - Bee: Goodnight bb ☺️
05/12/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I was on back to back calls with Rufus and then parents
05/12/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you had a busy day too 😂. Lists are made so that you remember the task for the next opportunity you have to do them
05/12/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a lovely time at worship tomorrow! And praying for your family hour thing as well
05/12/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be meeting up with Stephen and Timmy soon
06/12/2020, 06:29 - Bee: Hey!
06/12/2020, 06:29 - Bee: Family hour and worship went well
06/12/2020, 06:29 - Bee: Everyone participated! Those who stayed back
06/12/2020, 06:30 - Bee: How's Rufus doing?
06/12/2020, 06:30 - Bee: And parents?
06/12/2020, 06:30 - Bee: I did. Slept for 10 hours last night
06/12/2020, 06:30 - Bee: Carrying over yesterday's list to today
06/12/2020, 06:30 - Bee: And adding a meet with Shalini
06/12/2020, 06:31 - Bee: Met Stephen after a while no?
06/12/2020, 08:55 - Bee: -2° 😮
06/12/2020, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't know it if you hadn't told me. House heater is working well
06/12/2020, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: It has been a while! It was nice fun conversations through dinner
06/12/2020, 09:41 - Nischal Abraham: I slept for 9 😁
06/12/2020, 09:43 - Nischal Abraham: Parents are well. They've booked Chennai flight tickets
06/12/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Any jokes about his weight? I guess not. Since Daniel wasn't there
06/12/2020, 13:11 - Bee: I was groggy in the morning despite 10hours
06/12/2020, 13:11 - Bee: Oh cool! Will be a fun trip
06/12/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: I found out as soon as I stepped out 😂. There's frost everywhere and the trees and grass is lined white
06/12/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: It's pretty looking but not so pretty standing in
06/12/2020, 14:12 - Bee: 😂
06/12/2020, 14:12 - Bee: I can imagine
06/12/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Hi bb
06/12/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Last minute trip to Alibagh is tomorrow
06/12/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Will be back Tuesday evening
06/12/2020, 17:11 - Bee: I'm not sure if we can get on a call tomorrow :(
06/12/2020, 17:11 - Bee: Will find out tomorrow only
06/12/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Bb
06/12/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Hope you're having a great day 😊
06/12/2020, 17:48 - Bee: I miss you
06/12/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Goodnight. :))
06/12/2020, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! Enjoy your trip Bee. We can find another time to get on call if you're busy tomorrow
06/12/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: I was wondering how it's going to work out for me too. Cause I won't have a room directly in the office
06/12/2020, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: But we can see tomorrow how it works out
06/12/2020, 21:54 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
06/12/2020, 21:56 - Nischal Abraham: It was! Really tired at the end of the day again. But it's been a good one
06/12/2020, 21:57 - Nischal Abraham: There was still some jokes I made on Daniels behalf. Not nearly as good
06/12/2020, 21:58 - Nischal Abraham: Rufus is well too! He's been keeping busy with part time work and college. He needs to find an internship for his next semester which hasn't been easy for him so far
06/12/2020, 22:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm curious to hear how this trip was planned but excited you get to have a pre-vacation vacation 😂. Who will be going?
06/12/2020, 22:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well all questions can be asked and answered later. I'll be leaving for work with Maggie tomorrow. Don't know if I told you already but Heather's arrived safely. Hazel (Gareth's sis) had her baby - Rebecca Joy Rogers
06/12/2020, 22:01 - Nischal Abraham: This is on the down low for now so don't tell anyone else - Diane is pregnant!!!
06/12/2020, 22:02 - Nischal Abraham: Aaaah so many babies all round 😂. You'd have loved to be here
06/12/2020, 22:02 - Nischal Abraham: This aside
06/12/2020, 22:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>

06/12/2020, 22:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
06/12/2020, 22:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
06/12/2020, 22:04 - Nischal Abraham: ^ Afternoon activity. They finished the gray of the walls by the end of it
06/12/2020, 22:07 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you read all of this! I'm sorry I haven't been able to reply more often through the day. And I'm doubtful of timings for calls at the minute
06/12/2020, 22:09 - Nischal Abraham: Not a day goes by where I wouldn't say you are my beloved. 
Worship nearly brought me to tears today. Meeting in a church is such a blessing I'd taken for granted for so long. Burdened for persecuted churches as I pray tonight
06/12/2020, 22:10 - Nischal Abraham: And praying for you always :)
07/12/2020, 07:24 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!
07/12/2020, 07:24 - Bee: Oh yes. I didn't think about that. It might be a while to wait for your ride and then go back home no
07/12/2020, 07:24 - Bee: Yep
07/12/2020, 07:25 - Bee: Looks like 6am or 6pm mannnnn
07/12/2020, 07:25 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about it!
07/12/2020, 07:25 - Bee: Ahh. Is he in his final year?
07/12/2020, 07:26 - Bee: It was literally last minute. Decided at 11pm last night
07/12/2020, 07:26 - Bee: Ashley, maa, papa, I
07/12/2020, 07:27 - Bee: Jason couldn't take leave at such short notice
07/12/2020, 07:27 - Bee: Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will you get to meet her?
07/12/2020, 07:27 - Bee: WWHHHOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
07/12/2020, 07:27 - Bee: ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
07/12/2020, 07:27 - Bee: I'm excited for them!!!!
07/12/2020, 07:28 - Bee: Also, does that mean they're going to get 5 more years wiser?
07/12/2020, 07:28 - Bee: Whaaa
07/12/2020, 07:30 - Bee: I would've 😊
07/12/2020, 07:30 - Bee: And not because of the babies
07/12/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Is this the front wall?
07/12/2020, 07:31 - Bee: Looks like a fancy palace man
07/12/2020, 07:31 - Bee: I wish I had uncles like Timon when I was a child 😂
07/12/2020, 07:32 - Bee: Don't be sorry... You were occupied
07/12/2020, 07:34 - Bee: ☺️
07/12/2020, 07:35 - Bee: It must've been wonderful 🥺
07/12/2020, 07:36 - Bee: Were yall allowed to sing,m
07/12/2020, 07:36 - Bee: ?*
07/12/2020, 07:37 - Bee: Also, I drove!!!!!!!!!!!
07/12/2020, 07:37 - Bee: We're near Alibagh
07/12/2020, 07:37 - Bee: It was a 3.5 hours drive. And I drove!!!!
07/12/2020, 08:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'll have to see for the first few days what time I end up reaching home
07/12/2020, 08:24 - Nischal Abraham: I think in his 3rd now. Then he'll have one more year to go after
07/12/2020, 08:25 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's cool! I didn't know Uncle was back already
07/12/2020, 08:25 - Nischal Abraham: Probably not anytime soon. They stay in Northern Ireland. The only baby I'm sure to meet is Gareth and Maggie's
07/12/2020, 08:25 - Nischal Abraham: Of course 😂
07/12/2020, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: Of course. You'd love the frost in the morning too 😊
07/12/2020, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: It is the front. And there won't be any side walls. It's a long enough project as is 😂. Gonna make some uprights to hold it up and finish painting in bricks for the walls
07/12/2020, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: I wish I could be an uncle like Timon but my mind doesn't work that way. I'll just have to surround myself with them instead
07/12/2020, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. But hymns were read out instead and I'd just hum the tune to myself
07/12/2020, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: WOAH!!! THAT'S AMAZING!!
07/12/2020, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: It's a nice experience driving long distance
07/12/2020, 09:01 - Bee: He returned yesterday evening
07/12/2020, 09:01 - Bee: He brought Port from Goa ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
07/12/2020, 09:07 - Bee: Ahhh. In Jan then
07/12/2020, 09:08 - Bee: Yep. Frosty mornings are one of me favourites. Right after horror movies and bitter gourd 😂
07/12/2020, 09:08 - Bee: My*
07/12/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Ah nice. Have fun! I'll be heading out now. Maggie is picking me up
07/12/2020, 09:08 - Bee: The front is a lot fancier than I imagined
07/12/2020, 09:08 - Bee: Cool. Have a good day! ☺️
07/12/2020, 09:09 - Bee: Spend enough time with Timon and you'll get there
07/12/2020, 17:40 - Bee: Hi Nischal
07/12/2020, 17:40 - Bee: I'm guessing you haven't reached home yet
07/12/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Can't keep my eyes from shutting any longer :(
07/12/2020, 17:41 - Bee: Had a long fun day
07/12/2020, 17:41 - Bee: How was your day? Tell me okay
07/12/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Even though I'll be reading your messages in the morning
07/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: I was looking for a Dev cheesy line but I'm too sleepy to try and understand any and I don't want to send you one without knowing what it means
07/12/2020, 17:50 - Bee: Here's a medical one for now
07/12/2020, 17:50 - Bee: You must be my coronary artery because you're wrapped around my heart.
07/12/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Like really.
07/12/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))
07/12/2020, 20:49 - Nischal Abraham: I just reached home now. After work Timon and I went over to Noel and Liza's for dinner
07/12/2020, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: Followed by a nice walk around town. The chill got to my nose but my hoody saved my ears 😁
07/12/2020, 20:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's lovely! You'd better be remembering all of that or at least writing down some of it
07/12/2020, 22:30 - Nischal Abraham: I woke up by 7:20, had my morning routine, conversation with Timon over breakfast, he left by 8:10, I was being picked up by Maggie at 9.
Another very frosty day, the trees and grass were lined white and it reminded me of the first scene from the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe. Work was the same for the most part. Finally went to the bank to submit my documents and open an Irish Bank account. I had packed sandwiches for lunch with cheese and cold cuts.
In the evening Timon came by to pick me up, we went to Noel and Liza's for dinner. Then Noel, Timon and I headed out for a walk. 
After that we came back home around 8:30, I was catching up on mails and he was doing some work stuff as well. And now I'm just about to switch off my internet and read for a little before sleeping
07/12/2020, 22:31 - Nischal Abraham: Agenda for tomorrow is Gareth will be picking me up for work. I'll be cooking dinner since Timon will be late home from work. I'll tell you what I'm making once I'm done making it 😂
07/12/2020, 22:36 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
07/12/2020, 22:36 - Nischal Abraham: I was gonna send an anatomical heart but that was a creepy gif search 😶. Maybe not for you but it was for me
07/12/2020, 22:39 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Bee! Enjoy your last day of vacation!! I'm sure you'd enjoy being able to drive back as well 😁. You are always in my prayers. Reading your messages in the morning leave me smiling silly. And I love that they do ☺️
08/12/2020, 07:02 - Bee: After dinner?! Wasn't it freezing?
08/12/2020, 07:03 - Bee: I hope you don't fall sick
08/12/2020, 07:03 - Bee: I think I'll remember all of it. There isn't much
08/12/2020, 07:03 - Bee: Will you be free for a call tonight? Or are we waiting for Thursday 😮
08/12/2020, 07:04 - Bee: What are you reading?
08/12/2020, 07:04 - Bee: Beginning at Moses?
08/12/2020, 07:05 - Bee: I was going to ask you about what you're planning on making 😛 then read your last sentence
08/12/2020, 07:05 - Bee: 😂 not for me no. Seen too many to be grossed out
08/12/2020, 07:08 - Bee: I'm not sure if I'll be driving back. Papa wants to. 😕
08/12/2020, 07:08 - Bee: Maybe I'll get to drive halfway
08/12/2020, 07:10 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
08/12/2020, 07:10 - Bee: Your messages leave me feeling the same
08/12/2020, 07:16 - Bee: This is me after reading your messages
08/12/2020, 07:17 - Bee: I hope you have a goooooood day ☺️
08/12/2020, 07:17 - Bee: Looking forward to whenever we get to talk
08/12/2020, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: It wasn't the worst. Once you get walking it's only the face that feels cold
08/12/2020, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: I pray I don't. I've been well so far
08/12/2020, 07:59 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice. I look forward to hearing about it 😊
08/12/2020, 07:59 - Nischal Abraham: I could possibly be free for a call today. But I don't know how early I'll be getting home. Need to see who can drop me in the evening. I'll let you know when I know
08/12/2020, 08:00 - Nischal Abraham: The pilgrim's progress is my casual reading
08/12/2020, 08:00 - Nischal Abraham: That's my study book
08/12/2020, 08:00 - Nischal Abraham: Fair point. I wonder if you've ever been grossed out by it or just plain curious
08/12/2020, 08:01 - Nischal Abraham: Haha that's fair 😂. You did drive all the way there
08/12/2020, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Me too ☺️. I do wonder when that will be. If I get Wednesday off from work it's possible we could talk in the day if you're free. I'll find out more later today
08/12/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Okay nana. I'll be back home in 20 and then am free after
08/12/2020, 12:13 - Bee: Just plain curious
08/12/2020, 12:14 - Bee: I got to drive for an hour on our way back!!
08/12/2020, 12:14 - Bee: Cool cool. Let me know whenever
08/12/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee. Still no sight of clarity on when I'll be home for the day
08/12/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Hi bb
08/12/2020, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: If you want to head to bed that's alright. I'll message when I do get home
08/12/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Okay. I'll message you whenever I'm about to go to bed
08/12/2020, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure your tired from the day. Travelling is never a relaxing time
08/12/2020, 15:49 - Bee: We can talk tomorrow. Or whenever we find the time 😊 don't worry about it
08/12/2020, 15:49 - Bee: Yep. Tired. But I haven't touched anything on my to do list. I'm going to try to start a few tonight
08/12/2020, 15:49 - Bee: But we'll see
08/12/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: There's a 70% chance I'll have a holiday tomorrow
08/12/2020, 15:50 - Bee: Then there's a 70% chance we get to talk tomorrow 😮
08/12/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: There's always tomorrow to be doing the things you've planned to do
08/12/2020, 15:50 - Bee: That's 69% more than today
08/12/2020, 15:50 - Nischal Abraham: Was there only 1% today?
08/12/2020, 15:51 - Bee: Yep. And with each tomorrow it will be time to go to Mangalore
08/12/2020, 15:51 - Bee: If I complacently go to sleep just because I'm sleepy, yes. But I'm going to do stuff
08/12/2020, 15:51 - Bee: Starting with applying mashed bananas to my hair
08/12/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Don't exhaust yourself though. What do you plan to get done tonight anyway?
08/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: This, shower, read some
08/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: I'll take at least an hour to do these
08/12/2020, 16:34 - Bee: Not doing this tonight. Maa said it's best if I don't wash my hair so late in the night because I'll have to go to sleep with wet hair
08/12/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: So just read some then? Gareth will be taking me home at 5. So I should be free from 5:15pm if nothing else pops up
08/12/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Okay. I'll be here
08/12/2020, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
08/12/2020, 17:19 - Bee: Free?

09/12/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: That is beautiful!! 😮
09/12/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: And the food looks so goood!! It's making me hungry just looking at it 😋
09/12/2020, 09:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free for a call anytime from now till later in the day? Well whenever you're free
09/12/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you managed to get things done this morning! Were you sleepy from staying up?
09/12/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Did you go for a walk with Reenee?
09/12/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Did you buy your crochet needles?
09/12/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Did you work on your CV?
09/12/2020, 09:33 - Nischal Abraham: Do you want me to stop asking questions?
09/12/2020, 09:33 - Bee: Brb
09/12/2020, 10:28 - Bee: Ikr. Papa and I were looking at photos from the trip and we longed for more seafood
09/12/2020, 10:28 - Bee: What time are you gonna have lunch?
09/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: I'll be free in 30 minutes. Until dinner time. And then after dinner too
09/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Nope, wasn't sleepy
09/12/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: I've just made breakfast for myself 😂
09/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Woke up at 7:30. Went for a walk with Reenee and returned at 9:30
09/12/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: So lunch will be a while
09/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Not yet. I will do that today
09/12/2020, 10:30 - Bee: I started. Didn't finish...
09/12/2020, 10:30 - Bee: Never
09/12/2020, 10:30 - Bee: Ooh. Late morning?
09/12/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: A relaxed one, yes
09/12/2020, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: Cool. Call me in 30 min then
09/12/2020, 10:34 - Bee: I shall
09/12/2020, 10:38 - Nischal Abraham: 😊

09/12/2020, 14:15 - Bee: http://en.battleship-game.org/
09/12/2020, 15:23 - Bee: Cant fine anything else that we can do :(
09/12/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Battleship is a fun game!
09/12/2020, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: Or we could play connect 4
09/12/2020, 15:26 - Bee: https://c4arena.com/
Connect 4!!!!!!
09/12/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Dude whaaattttttttt
09/12/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Coincidence
09/12/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Coincidence yes. Not like I knew what you were going to say
09/12/2020, 15:52 - Bee: Did you?
09/12/2020, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: No no... I didn't. That's what I said right?
09/12/2020, 16:04 - Bee: You did, yes
09/12/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: Messages are done. Although this license thing doesn't seem any easier now than it did while I was on call
09/12/2020, 16:18 - Bee: Maybe you'll have to get it done in person
09/12/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I found an added step that needs doing
09/12/2020, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
09/12/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Nischal
09/12/2020, 16:35 - Bee: Give me 15?
09/12/2020, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
09/12/2020, 17:01 - Bee: 5 minutes. I'M SO SORRY.
09/12/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time
09/12/2020, 17:10 - Bee: Hi
09/12/2020, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
09/12/2020, 17:11 - Bee: I'll call?
10/12/2020, 10:26 - Bee: Hi friend. Hope you're having a good day so far
10/12/2020, 10:26 - Bee: Decided not to go for the wedding. It starts only at 7 and I'll be back late if I go. Travel is 2 hours one way and I'll have to change buses too
10/12/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Parents told me not to go
10/12/2020, 10:27 - Bee: I'll go pick up my crochet needle instead
10/12/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. Well you'll have more time to crochet then!
10/12/2020, 11:48 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been well. The power went out a few minutes back so I'm marking papers now 😂
10/12/2020, 12:53 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/12/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Yes. Just started
10/12/2020, 12:54 - Bee: Ahhh. Power's back?
10/12/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Having lunch now
10/12/2020, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh. Went for blue and black then
10/12/2020, 13:50 - Bee: The blue looks kinda different in the photo
10/12/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: Photos rarely look as good as it really does
10/12/2020, 15:51 - Bee: I know nothing about crochet
10/12/2020, 15:51 - Bee: It's so difficult
10/12/2020, 16:09 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you'd done it before?
10/12/2020, 16:11 - Bee: I have down it before. Looking at the among us tutorial I think what I'd done before was quite basic
10/12/2020, 16:11 - Bee: Done*
10/12/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I'm enjoying it though. I like creating with my hands and I like a challenge
10/12/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I'm learning
10/12/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I'm happy. ☺️☺️☺️
10/12/2020, 16:19 - Bee: I don't want to stop doing it
10/12/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds fun 😊. I'm so tired and lethargic today. Done with work for the day though
10/12/2020, 16:45 - Bee: Who's your ride for today?
10/12/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Gareth for back home
10/12/2020, 16:51 - Bee: Waiting for him?
10/12/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. He's got some last few emails to go through
10/12/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Back home finally! How did the crocheting got?
10/12/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Go*?
10/12/2020, 17:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
10/12/2020, 17:23 - Bee: It's going somewhere
10/12/2020, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: That looks good!
10/12/2020, 17:25 - Bee: Does it look like a leg?
10/12/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: It has shape
10/12/2020, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: As long as you're improving from your clay models I think you'll be fine
10/12/2020, 17:25 - Bee: That clay model was bomb
10/12/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: It looked like it survived a bomb
10/12/2020, 17:35 - Bee: That looked like a survivor to you?!
10/12/2020, 17:35 - Bee: It was dead
10/12/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: So it was post bomb
10/12/2020, 17:42 - Bee: Looked like it. Maybe that's why AA found it hilarious
10/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope the crochet turns out to be pre-bombed
10/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Or else you could just say it was killed by the imposter 😂
10/12/2020, 17:50 - Bee: There's a different crochet pattern for one that's killed 😫
10/12/2020, 17:59 - Bee: No more crochet for tonight. I started making mistakes and couldn't concentrate
10/12/2020, 17:59 - Bee: What's up?
10/12/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Looking forward to hearing about your day the next time we talk
10/12/2020, 18:10 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. :))
10/12/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
10/12/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Today's dinner. The lighting isn't very flattering but it was VERY tasty
10/12/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I couldn't reply. Got busy with cooking 🙁. I've got an off day tomorrow as well. Let me know if you're free for a call
10/12/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be leaving for prayer meeting at drum in half an hour now
11/12/2020, 06:07 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/12/2020, 06:08 - Bee: It looks tasty
11/12/2020, 06:08 - Bee: Is this Alfredo's?
11/12/2020, 06:09 - Bee: It's okay nana. I'm free during my night. Going to Manali Didi's after lunch. Then there's sisters meeting and the extended fam meeting after
11/12/2020, 08:23 - Bee: <Media omitted>
11/12/2020, 08:24 - Bee: I might finish earlier than I thought
11/12/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Aww those look so tiny and cute!
11/12/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: It's a carbonara recipe but we didn't have enough spaghetti so used penne
11/12/2020, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Ah yes Fridays are full days. That's good. I look forward to a night call then ☺️.
Praying you have a lovely day!
11/12/2020, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: That's good progress you have! Did you find stuffing for it?
11/12/2020, 10:10 - Bee: Not yet. I think I'll cut open the stuffed ball that I have.
11/12/2020, 10:10 - Bee: Waiiitt. I _might_ find it at the store I got the yarn from
11/12/2020, 10:11 - Bee: I'll check
11/12/2020, 10:11 - Bee: You too, Nischal
11/12/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Looking forward to the night ☺️
11/12/2020, 10:11 - Bee: What's your day like today?
11/12/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Late waking up, late breakfast, finish up a bunch of things I need to do and then get to reading books on Isaiah
11/12/2020, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and today's game night so probably ordering pizza for dinner and playing computer games
11/12/2020, 14:00 - Bee: I GOT TWO DABBAS OF KAPPA
11/12/2020, 14:00 - Bee: And fish pickle also!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
11/12/2020, 14:01 - Bee: Ahhhhhhh
11/12/2020, 14:01 - Bee: So call before that no?
11/12/2020, 14:01 - Bee: I should be free by 10. Is that too late? Will try to finish stuff before that
11/12/2020, 14:01 - Bee: What time works for you?
11/12/2020, 14:02 - Bee: Is Alex coming over? 
(I hope that's his name)
11/12/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: WOAH!
11/12/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: Yes. Call before that
11/12/2020, 14:03 - Bee: Shirly aunty and Biju uncle brought it over
11/12/2020, 14:03 - Nischal Abraham: 10 is fine by me. It just won't be a 3 hour long call. I hope that's alright with you
11/12/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's his name 😂. I hope he's coming. But we'll only know when the time comes
11/12/2020, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Did you get to see them? How's Nidhi?
11/12/2020, 14:05 - Bee: It is. Any duration I get to talk to you as good.
11/12/2020, 14:06 - Bee: Ahh. I'll never forget henceforth
11/12/2020, 14:07 - Bee: I did. Nidhi wasn't there. I think they dropped her off because exams. They'd gone to the dentist to take out Nids stitches and dropped her off and then came over
11/12/2020, 14:19 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. I'll be on call with them in a few minutes
11/12/2020, 14:19 - Nischal Abraham: Also mom said pickle tastes best the longer it stays. So don't finish it all in one day
11/12/2020, 15:11 - Bee: 😒
11/12/2020, 15:11 - Bee: I won't finish it in one day 😒
11/12/2020, 15:11 - Bee: 😒😒😒😒😒😒

11/12/2020, 15:40 - Bee: I'll finish it in half a day
11/12/2020, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Don't!!
11/12/2020, 15:43 - Bee: You said one day
11/12/2020, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: That's still one day
11/12/2020, 15:43 - Bee: Half a day isn't one day
11/12/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: It is "in" one day
11/12/2020, 15:44 - Bee: No
11/12/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Don't!!!
11/12/2020, 15:56 - Nischal Abraham: So neither Alex nor Stephen is coming. Looks like it'll just be me and Timon
11/12/2020, 16:09 - Bee: Won't
11/12/2020, 16:09 - Bee: What game are y'all playing?

11/12/2020, 18:23 - Bee: Goodnight 😊
11/12/2020, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: That blanket looks so comfy!!
11/12/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: I think Kappa is fairly easy to make. But I've never made it so maybe I'm not the best person to be telling you 😅
11/12/2020, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight and sweet dreams!
12/12/2020, 10:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>

12/12/2020, 10:31 - Bee: Good morning!
12/12/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: Good evening! I had another late start to the day. Pancakes and bacon for breakfast/brunch
12/12/2020, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds delicious 😱
12/12/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day been!? Clothes given for altering? Crocheting completed?
12/12/2020, 11:28 - Nischal Abraham: Any big plans for the day?
12/12/2020, 13:55 - Bee: Hi Nischal
12/12/2020, 13:55 - Bee: I was napping
12/12/2020, 13:55 - Bee: Off day today?
12/12/2020, 13:55 - Bee: It was maaan

12/12/2020, 13:56 - Bee: Went to the mall with Jason because he wanted to buy more stuff
12/12/2020, 13:56 - Bee: Became upset because I couldn't buy my stuffing. Jason had to be back for work
12/12/2020, 13:57 - Bee: Took a nap because I was upset

12/12/2020, 13:59 - Bee: Finished crocheting tonight
12/12/2020, 13:59 - Bee: What's up?
12/12/2020, 14:07 - Bee: To finish*
12/12/2020, 14:49 - Nischal Abraham: Saturday so yea. But we're out for the walk and I've got no network now so you'll probably only receive this when I'm back
12/12/2020, 14:50 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh lovely
12/12/2020, 14:50 - Nischal Abraham: That's a nice way to cope
12/12/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: Woohoo!!!
12/12/2020, 14:54 - Nischal Abraham: Walk now, dinner with Timmy at the Indian place and then see where the night takes me
12/12/2020, 15:47 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/12/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: That looks so good!! 😱😱
12/12/2020, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Nicely done Debby!
12/12/2020, 17:01 - Bee: I received it. Does it mean you're back?
12/12/2020, 17:01 - Bee: I have a terrible headache now. My first nap in a month
12/12/2020, 17:02 - Bee: What did you have the last time you went? Enjoy!
12/12/2020, 17:02 - Bee: Thank you ☺️
12/12/2020, 17:34 - Bee: <Media omitted>
12/12/2020, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't go last time. There was a prayer meeting online
12/12/2020, 17:51 - Bee: Ben sent his video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12/12/2020, 18:29 - Bee: Hey bb :)
12/12/2020, 18:29 - Bee: Goodnight ☺️
12/12/2020, 18:33 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Sorry I couldn't talk more
12/12/2020, 22:05 - Nischal Abraham: Indian was expectedly not great. But the company and laughs were lovely 😊
12/12/2020, 22:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I was. The walk was lovely too. Walked 5.5km in 45 min with a bunch of lads. There wasn't much to do as a leader other than sticking with them through the walk
12/12/2020, 22:07 - Nischal Abraham: Played some Age of Empires with Timon in the afternoon before we left 😂. It's nice having a gaming buddy. My mind wandered to think what living with my best friend would be like
12/12/2020, 22:09 - Nischal Abraham: Praying you have a lovely time of worship in the morning! I look forward to another Sunday at Drum 😌. Can't believe it's already been a week!! Time moves so quickly sometimes
12/12/2020, 22:10 - Nischal Abraham: I'm going to stop messaging post this one cause it's 2 ticks which would mean your network is on and the messages are going through 😶. I'd hate to be waking anyone up at an untimely hour in the night. Hope your dreams are sweet as you rest. Praying for you always
13/12/2020, 02:55 - Bee: Hey Debbi!!! Thank you so much! For bring there for me from day one . Really you have encouraged me a lot in so many ways . I accepted Lord Jesus Christ as my saviour yesterday in front of siby aunty
13/12/2020, 02:55 - Bee: Radhika!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13/12/2020, 02:58 - Bee: Today in the assembly I will try to tell my journey but I really need God's help please pray for me that He be glorified and it won't be about me and He help me to say what He wants me to say
13/12/2020, 05:55 - Bee: Hi bb ☺️
13/12/2020, 05:55 - Bee: Don't be
13/12/2020, 05:55 - Bee: Was the food sweet?
13/12/2020, 05:56 - Bee: Oh! How many were in your group? Timon, Gareth, Noel were there too?
13/12/2020, 05:56 - Bee: 😂
13/12/2020, 05:57 - Bee: I'm sure Ankush would enjoy living with you 😊
13/12/2020, 05:57 - Bee: Worship in person!!!!!!! Wow.
13/12/2020, 05:58 - Bee: I had a lovely time of worship. Radhika shared her testimony. Jos uncle from Kerala shared the Word. Makayla made an appearance 😋
13/12/2020, 05:59 - Bee: I forgot to turn my internet off. But my phone was on mute so no problem. I don't know if my dreams were sweet. I don't remember them. Praying for you too, bb. ☺️
13/12/2020, 06:00 - Bee: Papa is cooking lunch for today. Hope to finish crocheting in the afternoon. I don't want to take a nap fearing I might have a headache after like yesterday. There's a small prayer meeting at Rebekah's house at 5pm. Rebekah from our assembly. Papa and I will be going. Nothing else planned
13/12/2020, 08:25 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/12/2020, 08:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/12/2020, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's wonderful! I'm so happy for her!!! Keeping her and you in prayers
13/12/2020, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I had to exchange half of my chicken tikka masala with Timon's lamb gosht which was slightly less sweet 😂
13/12/2020, 09:06 - Nischal Abraham: Just Timon, me and another girl named Katie as leaders in the group I was in. Gareth was in a different one
13/12/2020, 09:06 - Nischal Abraham: No silly. It's you
13/12/2020, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: I know!! 😱. I'm so excited
13/12/2020, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice!
13/12/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you 😊. I'm glad I didn't disturb your household
13/12/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a peaceful day. Praying for the meeting too

13/12/2020, 09:12 - Nischal Abraham: The 3 groups
13/12/2020, 09:43 - Bee: Brb
13/12/2020, 15:30 - Bee: Thank you. Will you let the lads know too? You mentioned once that you had shared with them and that they were praying for her as well
13/12/2020, 15:31 - Bee: 😂 
Very few things are worse than sweet Indian food. I once had sweet butter chicken when Ella had visited. I came back home hungry
13/12/2020, 15:34 - Bee: I was pulling your leg nana. I know it's me. ☺️
13/12/2020, 15:34 - Bee: How did it go?
13/12/2020, 15:34 - Bee: It wasn't a peaceful day. But a good one
13/12/2020, 15:35 - Bee: Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!
13/12/2020, 15:35 - Bee: I'm happy with how it turned out
13/12/2020, 15:36 - Bee: I sent a photo to Josh (Ruth's brother) and he asked me to make one for him. I bought some more yarn! Red colour among others. Red is for him
13/12/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Staahhhpp
13/12/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Bb ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
13/12/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Stephen no
13/12/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Where's Gareth?
13/12/2020, 15:36 - Bee: Who are the 2 lil cuties?
13/12/2020, 15:37 - Bee: After lunch was a trip to Thane station to look for a kurta for Jason. I wanted to buy better quality yarn which I thought would be available there but couldn't find any. Came home right in time to leave for the prayer meeting at Rebekah's
13/12/2020, 15:38 - Bee: Just came back homw
13/12/2020, 15:38 - Bee: Home*
13/12/2020, 15:38 - Bee: Tiring day nana
13/12/2020, 15:38 - Bee: Ever since I've been home o haven't had even one day for myself. I think I'm complaining too much
13/12/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Manju Didi is coming over tomorrow. I don't know if you know/remember her. She's from Gangtok. Will tell you when we talk next
13/12/2020, 15:39 - Bee: I*
13/12/2020, 15:39 - Bee: Also, did y'all walk while socially distancing? Also, how come nobody is wearing beanies or scarves or muffs? Is it not that cold?
13/12/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Brb
13/12/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: Actually not right back. I'm still at Gareth's place so I'll message my replies at the end of the day
13/12/2020, 17:44 - Bee: No problem. Bye!
13/12/2020, 18:52 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal ☺️
13/12/2020, 18:53 - Bee: Don't worry about not being able to reply
13/12/2020, 18:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/12/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Bye, marshmallow.
13/12/2020, 18:58 - Bee: <Media omitted>
13/12/2020, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: Will do that. I had mentioned it once to them. I'm sure they'll be delighted to hear it too!
13/12/2020, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Ah can't be wasting €8 dishes now. I gobbled all of that down
13/12/2020, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: You make my stomach flutter
13/12/2020, 21:05 - Nischal Abraham: It was wonderful again! 😭(tears of joy and gratitude). I can't believe that there was a younger me who did not like going for Sunday worship meetings. Well I can believe it... I'd love to share this experience to him and make him realise what precious opportunity he's missing
13/12/2020, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: Do you mean it was busy? Or did something happen?
13/12/2020, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: Oh lovely! You better be charging him for that now 😂
13/12/2020, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: Staahhhpp
13/12/2020, 21:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yess... And his sister Joyce is next to him. And Arlene is somewhere in that photo as well
13/12/2020, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: Gareth is taking this photo. And the 2 lil cuties are his. Eva is blonde and Rachel is the other one
13/12/2020, 21:10 - Nischal Abraham: It's difficult to find days for yourself sometimes. Just make time for prayer and the Bible and I think everything else should work out when they can or need to
13/12/2020, 21:10 - Nischal Abraham: You mentioned her but I don't think I know who she is
13/12/2020, 21:12 - Nischal Abraham: The lads are brave that way 😂. It was cold enough to freeze my ears off by the end of it. I didn't realise how bad it would be and didn't carry my hat along. And yes, we walked socially distanced (for the most part)
13/12/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: Fluttering hearts and giddy with joy. And no I do not have a disease. It passes as soon as I stop thinking about you (which is rarer than you might think 😮)
13/12/2020, 21:15 - Nischal Abraham: Marshmallow and tea would be a strange combination. But they are wonderful in the hot chocolate they make at O'Learys. Praying you have a wonderful night yourself ☺️
14/12/2020, 04:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/12/2020, 06:18 - Bee: Gas?
14/12/2020, 06:19 - Bee: ☺️. I'm so happy you get to experience worship in person 😊. Younger me didn't know the value either
14/12/2020, 06:19 - Bee: It was busy. Nothing happened nana
14/12/2020, 06:20 - Bee: 😂
14/12/2020, 06:20 - Bee: Poor chap is already going through a lot man. If this brings a tiniest smile, then why not
14/12/2020, 06:21 - Bee: He got to see Arlene!!!! Which one is she?
14/12/2020, 06:21 - Bee: Ahhhhhh
They're so cute 😍🥺. I'm loving their energy
14/12/2020, 06:23 - Bee: I haven't made time for that either :(. Yesterday and the day before
14/12/2020, 07:51 - Bee: 😂 none of them look like they're cold
14/12/2020, 07:53 - Bee: Relieved that you don't have a disease.
14/12/2020, 08:07 - Bee: Fluttering hearts and giddy with joy is rare?
14/12/2020, 08:19 - Nischal Abraham: What's rare is that I stop thinking about you

14/12/2020, 08:46 - Bee: Did you send this photo so that you don't have to type all of it? Or does it have something to do with your cracked screen?
14/12/2020, 08:46 - Bee: Tell me about 11'ses the next time we talk. I don't know what game that is
14/12/2020, 08:47 - Bee: Lovely view!
14/12/2020, 08:47 - Bee: Did Gareth build the treehouse?
14/12/2020, 08:48 - Bee: Is this in the attic? Or the living room?
14/12/2020, 08:48 - Bee: Timon has started wearing Christmas sweaters already eh
14/12/2020, 08:48 - Bee: Do the brown gates open?
14/12/2020, 08:48 - Bee: Fancy stuff man
14/12/2020, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: The former. I was gonna send it last night but was too tired to type it out. Then today after I wrote it I remembered but then this saves the hassle of writing the same thing twice 😌
14/12/2020, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: Timon did. During the initial months of lockdown
14/12/2020, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: Living room
14/12/2020, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: Yes 😂
14/12/2020, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: Oh you can't see it in the photo but the Christmas tree is already set up in that room
14/12/2020, 09:14 - Nischal Abraham: They do! And that's in the attic
14/12/2020, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the day? Praying you have a good one 😊
14/12/2020, 10:55 - Bee: It does save the hassle
14/12/2020, 10:55 - Bee: Dude whaaaaat.
14/12/2020, 10:55 - Bee: <Media omitted>
14/12/2020, 10:56 - Bee: Meet Persis for 5 Minutes. She's going back to Vellore tomorrow morning. No other plans
14/12/2020, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: You progressed really quickly on this one! I wonder if you'll be done with it by the end of the day. Gonna start packing anytime soon?
14/12/2020, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: Also will you be free for a call at my 5:30pm? I'm not sure if I will myself yet, but if I am I'd love to get on a call
14/12/2020, 11:46 - Bee: Nope. Did I mention that push off packing until the very last minute? That's what I do. I'll pack on Thursday
14/12/2020, 11:46 - Bee: Instead of Friday morning. We leave Friday afternoon
14/12/2020, 11:48 - Bee: I will be free whenever you are

14/12/2020, 11:53 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I'll message whenever I know for sure ☺️
14/12/2020, 12:01 - Bee: Cool cool cool.

14/12/2020, 12:01 - Bee: I miss you. Looking forward to tonight/whenever we get to tall

14/12/2020, 12:01 - Bee: Talk*!!!!!!!
14/12/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee. Looks like today won't be happening 😞
14/12/2020, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: If you want to go to bed then do. I'll let you know when I get home though it won't be anytime in the next half hour
14/12/2020, 17:08 - Bee: I'll be up for a while. Let me know when you get home and if I'm up we'll talk :)
14/12/2020, 17:08 - Bee: Sorry about the call. Ruth didn't believe you were busy 😂. But yeah, sorry...

15/12/2020, 08:18 - Nischal Abraham: Those look lovely! Thanks for sharing Bee. Did you find them on Pinterest?
15/12/2020, 08:30 - Bee: Yes, Pinterest 😊
15/12/2020, 08:30 - Bee: We posted Ruth's parcel with our letters. I'm excited for her. 🤩
15/12/2020, 08:31 - Bee: <Media omitted>
15/12/2020, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! How's your day been?
15/12/2020, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: I sent that message and then I was getting ready so I didn't message anymore
15/12/2020, 15:06 - Nischal Abraham: But my day's been well. Lunch was panini and Heather came downstairs to join us... We were socially distancing in the large room
15/12/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: Work continues as normal. We're closing in on the day that Maggie will be on leavr
15/12/2020, 15:07 - Nischal Abraham: Leave*
15/12/2020, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: I may be working tomorrow as well. Getting lessons sorted out for next month before Christmas week
15/12/2020, 15:26 - Bee: Alright. Slept in. Helped Jason pack. Went to the post office with Reenee. Got back and cleaned the house a bit. Crocheted a bit more. Had lunch and napped. Woke up and sorted all of my books out. Gave away books to a new nursing students. Epilated my arms. Then there was prayer meeting. Will wash my hair and have mushroom soup for dinner. Maa makes the best mushroom soup 😋 it's easy. I can send you the recipe
15/12/2020, 15:27 - Bee: I need to go to the tailer tomorrow. I don't know why I'm procrastinating
15/12/2020, 15:28 - Bee: I might get a haircut as well. Not sure yet. If I find the time I'll do it
15/12/2020, 15:29 - Bee: When's that?
15/12/2020, 15:29 - Bee: Will you have Christmas through New years off?
15/12/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh. Sounds like you got a lot done!
15/12/2020, 15:44 - Nischal Abraham: Won't it take time for the tailor to get to it as well?
15/12/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Do you need to take a booking for that?
15/12/2020, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: She's officially on leave from Friday this week
15/12/2020, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Just the 24-26 and I think 31st and 1st
15/12/2020, 16:47 - Bee: Yep. A day at least
15/12/2020, 16:47 - Bee: I must go tomorrow
15/12/2020, 16:47 - Bee: I might. Another thing I need to do tomorrow. Call and find out
15/12/2020, 16:47 - Bee: So many things to do!!
15/12/2020, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Call today?
15/12/2020, 16:50 - Bee: I'd love that. Will you be free?
15/12/2020, 16:50 - Bee: What time?
15/12/2020, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: There's a chance in half an hour. Well almost surely at your 11
15/12/2020, 17:01 - Bee: Cool. I'll be up 😊
15/12/2020, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/12/2020, 17:43 - Nischal Abraham: oh noo... I'm late :(
15/12/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry Bee
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Bee: HIIIII
15/12/2020, 17:47 - Bee: My phone was kept for charging
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Am I late? :(
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Bee: Nooooooo
15/12/2020, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: Mine is too
15/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: You're online!!
15/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: Hi :)
15/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Hey :)
15/12/2020, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
15/12/2020, 17:49 - Bee: I'll call?
15/12/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Hi
15/12/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Hey. All good?
15/12/2020, 18:21 - Bee: I'll call?
15/12/2020, 18:21 - Bee: Yes yes
15/12/2020, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
16/12/2020, 07:59 - Bee: Good morning, Nischal!
16/12/2020, 07:59 - Bee: Praying you have a great day 😊
16/12/2020, 07:59 - Bee: Decided to get a haircut. On my way now
16/12/2020, 08:13 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you're dropping by the tailors as well while you're out
16/12/2020, 08:13 - Nischal Abraham: I bought the Galaxy M31. It was cheap enough and I really don't care as long as it lasts me at least 2 years from now
16/12/2020, 08:16 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/12/2020, 08:16 - Bee: Yep. After haircut. I've got my stuff with me
16/12/2020, 08:16 - Bee: We are phone buddies now!!!!
16/12/2020, 08:16 - Bee: M31 is a good choice.
16/12/2020, 08:18 - Bee: 🥺
16/12/2020, 08:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yea the M series is only for Indian market it seems. I couldn't buy it off Amazon so got it on AliExpress. If it makes it in one piece that may be my go to site to order stuff cause delivery is free to Ireland 😂
16/12/2020, 08:52 - Bee: And if it doesn't make it in one piece?
16/12/2020, 09:35 - Nischal Abraham: Then I'll have a two piece phone
16/12/2020, 10:40 - Bee: As long as you're okay with it
16/12/2020, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: As long as I get to hear you clearly on calls I'll be fine
16/12/2020, 11:01 - Bee: ☺️
16/12/2020, 11:01 - Bee: Also you should be able to watch https://youtu.be/NNhpTwvPyeM when you're free
16/12/2020, 12:08 - Bee: Since you'll be cooking dinner once you're back, a call won't be possible tonight right?
16/12/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yea it'd be best to call it off for today. Maybe tomorrow? What time do you leave on Friday?
16/12/2020, 12:32 - Bee: Tomorrow should be fine. I leave at 10:30am on Friday
16/12/2020, 12:57 - Nischal Abraham: Started packing?
16/12/2020, 13:07 - Bee: Yep. Kept stuff out. Need to put them in the suitcase
16/12/2020, 13:08 - Bee: How are you doing?
16/12/2020, 13:08 - Nischal Abraham: Doing alright. Looking up where the recipe for Biryani was but I think it's written in the back of my old journal which is currently inaccessible
16/12/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: So I'll have to Google a recipe and buy stuff accordingly
16/12/2020, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be heading to the shops in half an hour
16/12/2020, 13:37 - Bee: Ahhh. Found a recipe?
16/12/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: I did. And it seemed to need a LOT of spices. I found a pulao recipe my mom sent a while back so I'll probably make that instead
16/12/2020, 15:48 - Bee: Pulav sounds good too
16/12/2020, 15:49 - Bee: 😋
16/12/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Early night for me
16/12/2020, 17:16 - Bee: Enjoy cooking! And eating even more so
16/12/2020, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee. Enjoy early sleep ☺️. Hopefully we'll talk tomorrow
16/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Hopefully we will 😊
16/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Goodnight :)
16/12/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!
16/12/2020, 18:32 - Bee: Haven't slept yet. Been chatting with my girls. My heart is full.
16/12/2020, 18:33 - Bee: By my girls I mean Ruth and Reenee
16/12/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice!
16/12/2020, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm finally done with whatever i made. Started out as a pulav dish but now it's just rice and mince meat 😂
16/12/2020, 19:32 - Bee: How does it taste?
16/12/2020, 19:33 - Bee: It was kheema pulav?! Good stuff
16/12/2020, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/12/2020, 19:34 - Bee: No veggies?
16/12/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. I missed out on quite a bit with this one. Just followed the recipe completely
16/12/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: I have ideas for next time to make it better
16/12/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Adding veggies?
16/12/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: Yes adding veggies is one of them 😂
16/12/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: Still not sleeping?
16/12/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Just got off a call with Reenee and Ruth
16/12/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: So much for this 😂😂
16/12/2020, 19:36 - Bee: Not sleepy yet. I'll finish Reenee's video
16/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Hahahaha
16/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Ikr
16/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Also, no choreography. Reenee is busy
16/12/2020, 19:37 - Nischal Abraham: Alright. Have fun with the video. Timon's got a meeting for work to attend online so I'm just waiting for him to get done with that
16/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Maybe if I want going to Mangalore and had more time then we could've done it
16/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Wasn't*
16/12/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Ahhhh
16/12/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Is there raita as well?
16/12/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's alright. I thought she might be. I'll record a normal video and send. Sent reminders last night so I should receive more by tomorrow
16/12/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Just tomatoes and yogurt.
16/12/2020, 19:38 - Bee: Cool. I sent reminders too. But everyone said that they remember
16/12/2020, 19:38 - Bee: So that's good
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: But this works well in a pinch. I didn't want to add in the red onions... And the large onions are too big 😞
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Yum
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Just tomatoes is good too
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Bee: And salt right?
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yes. The most important ingredient
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Bee: Yep. It is
16/12/2020, 19:39 - Bee: How long is Timon going to take
16/12/2020, 19:40 - Bee: What will you do till then
16/12/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: I got flashbacks of asking mom to taste test the salt. I never know what the right amount is supposed to be
16/12/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: But I usually make a mistake in undersalting so it's easy to fix
16/12/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Timon will let you know today
16/12/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Ahhh. I always add too much salt and then keep apologising while everyone is eating
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. I feel bad he has to eat the pulav too 😂. I always end up underseasoning cause I'm afraid I'll mess up if I put too much
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Then add more no
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: You should make half the raita and I'll make half. Then we'll mix them together and it'll be perfect 😊
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Little by little
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Is it too late?
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Who's gonna make the pulav then
16/12/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: How do I add chilli powder and garam masala after its done cooking? Wait can I?
16/12/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: I thought they need to be used while cooking
16/12/2020, 19:42 - Bee: I think so
16/12/2020, 19:42 - Bee: With the water. While it's boiling
16/12/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. I salted and peppered extra at the end
16/12/2020, 19:42 - Bee: The rice
16/12/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep yep. All that is done now. No more core spices can be changed
16/12/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Only lessons for next time
16/12/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Next time
16/12/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Yesss
16/12/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: But I'm getting more confident making large batches 😁. I think there's enough to feed 4 people in there
16/12/2020, 19:43 - Bee: No need to cook tomorrow!
16/12/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's the idea. Make enough for leftovers
16/12/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: How are you editing videos while chatting?
16/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: You can make Dal if you want. It will go with the underseasoned pulav
16/12/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! I'll make Dal tomorrow and then we can have it with leftover pulav to make it better
16/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Paused the editing. Will get back to it after I say goodbye to you
16/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Yes nana
16/12/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Good thinking
16/12/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: How long does goodbye on chat take compared to call? 😶
16/12/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Much much much longer
16/12/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! Don't stay up for so long nana. I'm ruining your sleep cycles 😞
16/12/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! I just saw a feature in WhatsApp called disappearing messages
16/12/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Does that mean after a timer it gets deleted?
16/12/2020, 19:46 - Bee: Yeah? Haven't heard of it yet
16/12/2020, 19:47 - Bee: Is it like the self destruct feature on telegram?
16/12/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Click on my name at the top
16/12/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: And scroll below the starred messages
16/12/2020, 19:47 - Bee: I'll go to sleep in a bit. Earlier than last night at least.
16/12/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry Bee
16/12/2020, 19:47 - Bee: There's encryption
16/12/2020, 19:48 - Bee: I'm sorry too
16/12/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/12/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: Update your app Bee 😂. And my insta is updated I think my phone can't handle the reply feature
16/12/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Bee turned on disappearing messages. New messages will disappear from this chat after 7 days. Tap to change.
16/12/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Bee turned off disappearing messages. Tap to change.
16/12/2020, 19:52 - Bee: Updated and now I have it
16/12/2020, 19:53 - Bee: You have starred 85 messages
16/12/2020, 20:02 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal!
Good job on the pulav and trying something new 😊
16/12/2020, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Sorry we got to eating
16/12/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: I think that's shared starred messages between us. And it's 98 now that I was going through all messages 😂
16/12/2020, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: DEBBYY!!! Your starred messages must still be there then! Or can you not see the old chats?
17/12/2020, 05:53 - Bee: Shared starred messages?! Is that a new feature?
17/12/2020, 06:01 - Bee: Nope. No old starred messages :(
17/12/2020, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: I hadn't seen it before. But it doesn't tell me who starred things. Maybe it is just mine then
17/12/2020, 11:41 - Bee: Yes it shows only the ones I've starred
17/12/2020, 11:42 - Bee: Also, this is on!!!.
17/12/2020, 11:42 - Bee: I'm going over to Reenee's tonight
17/12/2020, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: How did you know I starred 85 then?
17/12/2020, 11:43 - Bee: Another update about the video, college friends have a submission tomorrow and so won't be able to send their video by tonight. They asked if we could postpone the deadline to the 19th. I said sure. So Reenee will be compiling it
17/12/2020, 11:43 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/12/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Oh right. I forgot about the screenshot
17/12/2020, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Alright. Is she okay doing that? Hope she's not too busy
17/12/2020, 12:25 - Bee: She's free at night she said
17/12/2020, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. How's your day going?
17/12/2020, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: It's busy here in the office. School lessons need to be returned today before Christmas week
17/12/2020, 13:14 - Bee: Alright. Low key panicking about tomorrow
17/12/2020, 13:14 - Bee: Ooh. You might have to stay after 5?
17/12/2020, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Why panicking?
17/12/2020, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: I hope not. I'll be back home whenever my ride goes home
17/12/2020, 16:14 - Bee: I'm not too keen about going
17/12/2020, 16:14 - Bee: :(
17/12/2020, 16:14 - Bee: Okay. I'm at Reenee's
17/12/2020, 16:41 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/12/2020, 16:41 - Bee: Starting from
After 'We just keep dancing like you do'
17/12/2020, 16:41 - Bee: From the part where she sings 22
17/12/2020, 16:41 - Bee: Look at Reenee okay
17/12/2020, 16:41 - Bee: I'm making mistakes
17/12/2020, 16:42 - Bee: Upto 0:24
17/12/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Hey I'm home
17/12/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Give me 5 min
17/12/2020, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Hi. I'm free for a call if you are
17/12/2020, 17:24 - Bee: I'm still at Reenee's nana
17/12/2020, 17:24 - Bee: Leaving in 5
17/12/2020, 17:25 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/12/2020, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Ah alright... No problem. Let me know if you're free. Having fun?
17/12/2020, 17:26 - Bee: You can learn and do from the previous one only
17/12/2020, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'll watch it now. Say hi to Reenee for me 😁
17/12/2020, 17:27 - Bee: She says helll
17/12/2020, 17:27 - Bee: Hello*
17/12/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: That's an interesting response 😂
17/12/2020, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: You seem dressed up for a dance rehearsal
17/12/2020, 17:30 - Nischal Abraham: Yep sticking to that one. The second one will take me 10 years to do without assistance
17/12/2020, 18:03 - Bee: Dressed up?!
17/12/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Just got home
17/12/2020, 18:04 - Bee: I'll have dinner and then call?
17/12/2020, 18:05 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I do have prayer meeting at Drum today so let me know when you're done and I'll let you know
17/12/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Oh

17/12/2020, 18:05 - Bee: Okay
17/12/2020, 18:06 - Bee: When will you have to leave?
17/12/2020, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: 10 min before that. Though I do need to have dinner as well

17/12/2020, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know when you're through
17/12/2020, 18:40 - Bee: Hi
17/12/2020, 18:40 - Bee: I'll call?
17/12/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Hi
17/12/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Nischal
17/12/2020, 18:41 - Bee: Hi!
17/12/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Missed voice call
17/12/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Hi
17/12/2020, 18:51 - Bee: Missed voice call
17/12/2020, 20:17 - Bee: ❤️
17/12/2020, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: It's these that get starred
17/12/2020, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
18/12/2020, 02:46 - Bee: That was before we got together!
18/12/2020, 05:56 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/12/2020, 06:48 - Bee: I'm in the train
18/12/2020, 06:48 - Bee: Praying for a safe journey. I know you are too
18/12/2020, 06:48 - Bee: I'm not that anxious anymore. About the trip
18/12/2020, 09:35 - Nischal Abraham: Praising God for that 😊. I am praying too. You've probably reached already. Live in the moment Bee!! Make the most of time with family
18/12/2020, 10:55 - Bee: I'm going by train nana. I will reach tomorrow morning
18/12/2020, 11:05 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea! Completely forgot. Enjoy the train journey then 😊
18/12/2020, 12:29 - Bee: I'm enjoying in the sense that I've been snacking ever since I got in
18/12/2020, 12:29 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Is it vada's and such from stations?
18/12/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: How's your network doing? I'm guessing you're on mobile data
18/12/2020, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Are you crocheting in the train? How are you passing your time?
18/12/2020, 12:33 - Bee: Nope. We have a bag full of chips and stuff
18/12/2020, 12:33 - Bee: So far, I've had internet on and off
18/12/2020, 12:33 - Bee: How's your day going?
18/12/2020, 12:33 - Bee: No internet again. Shyaaaaaa
18/12/2020, 12:34 - Bee: I slept for an hour. Crocheted a bit. But the tutorial that I've downloaded is difficult. It's a tutorial for something called a granny square. Then I'll stitch together many granny squares and make a tablecloth kinda thing
18/12/2020, 12:34 - Bee: We've been talking. Priya's mum is chatty
18/12/2020, 12:35 - Nischal Abraham: My day's been lazy. Woke up at 9... breakfast at 10:30. On a call with Nikhil for an hour at 11. I have a work related call at 2pm for the PBS website later. Alex may be joining us this evening so looking forward to that. Other than that I should be getting around to learning those dance steps while I'm home alone and send a recording to Reenee
18/12/2020, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: Oh lovely! That sounds like a large crowd of you in the train!! Did you get seats all near each other?
18/12/2020, 12:36 - Bee: Send it to me also pleeeeaaaasse
18/12/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Yep. There were two seats a bit far away but we managed to exchange them. So we're all together
18/12/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Ahhh off day today!
18/12/2020, 12:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yep will send to you too
18/12/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Cool. Thanks
18/12/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Whats for lunch?
18/12/2020, 12:37 - Bee: Will you be cooking dinner?
18/12/2020, 12:39 - Nischal Abraham: Lunch will be leftover Pulav... Don't know about dinner. If Alex is coming along it'll probably be pizza
18/12/2020, 12:40 - Nischal Abraham: What was your lunch?
18/12/2020, 13:08 - Bee: I had chapatis and cauliflower bhaji
18/12/2020, 13:08 - Bee: Pizza 😋
18/12/2020, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Packed lunch from home? Somehow they're always tasty when I'm travelling
18/12/2020, 13:35 - Bee: Yep. From home. Dinner will be Andhra stuff
18/12/2020, 13:36 - Bee: I don't like eating home cooked food in the train 😂 I love the egg biryani that they  offer
18/12/2020, 13:36 - Bee: And chips and stuff
18/12/2020, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: Of course. Chips and stuff are the healthiest meals to have
18/12/2020, 13:44 - Bee: 🤔
18/12/2020, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: Its not really... I was being sarcastic
18/12/2020, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: Do you get the top bunk? Do you like the top bunk?
18/12/2020, 13:44 - Bee: I love the top bunk
18/12/2020, 13:45 - Bee: I always take the top bunk. But I don't know if I'll get it tonight
18/12/2020, 13:45 - Bee: It's not?! What are you saying man
18/12/2020, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Who else would take it?
18/12/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Do you?
18/12/2020, 13:45 - Bee: Jason will take one
18/12/2020, 13:46 - Bee: Priya might take the other. She hardly slept last night and so she slept in the top bunk in the afternoon. So maybe she'll sleep there at night too
18/12/2020, 13:46 - Bee: What's up?
18/12/2020, 13:46 - Nischal Abraham: I do! Favourite one. I don't have to be disturbing anybody else to use it and I can avoid socialising 😂
18/12/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished recording the 22 video. Not half as good as you two but it'll have to do. I should also record my message for her but probably after my meeting
18/12/2020, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Where are you now?
18/12/2020, 13:50 - Bee: Same. I can be by myself. And will be called to come down only for main meals. Snacks will be delivered right up 😂
18/12/2020, 13:51 - Bee: Crossed Ratnagiri
18/12/2020, 13:51 - Bee: We'll reach at 4am tomorrow
18/12/2020, 13:52 - Bee: Will Nikhil need a reminder for the video?
18/12/2020, 13:52 - Bee: He might have a holiday today too right
18/12/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: I reminded him on the call
18/12/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: He has his worship meeting right now. He said he'll send after that
18/12/2020, 13:56 - Bee: Cool
18/12/2020, 13:56 - Bee: I've got two movies to watch
18/12/2020, 13:57 - Bee: I'll watch one now
18/12/2020, 13:57 - Bee: It's called Over the moon
18/12/2020, 13:57 - Nischal Abraham: Animated?
18/12/2020, 13:58 - Bee: Yes
18/12/2020, 13:58 - Bee: I also have The Addams family
18/12/2020, 13:58 - Bee: I'll watch that at night if I not able to fall asleep
18/12/2020, 13:59 - Bee: The part about traveling to Mangalore that I like most is getting down at Madgao. The train halts there for 10 minutes (longest compared to other stations)
18/12/2020, 13:59 - Bee: Traveling to Mangalore by train*
18/12/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: What's at Madgao?
18/12/2020, 14:19 - Bee: Nothing special as such. As a child I would stand in one place and look at everyone around
18/12/2020, 14:19 - Bee: Madgao is the capital of Goa
18/12/2020, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oooh cool! So what's happening now? My meeting's done
18/12/2020, 14:21 - Bee: Bustling station even at 12 at night, unlike the other stations we get on the way
18/12/2020, 14:22 - Bee: How did it go? What was it for?
18/12/2020, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Just to get used to the PBS website and be able to upload videos from here so we don't have to depend on the site admin just to upload new videos
18/12/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Finished a pack of pringles. Jason, Lydia (Priya's older sister), Priya, and I were talking so I stopped watching the movie
18/12/2020, 15:08 - Bee: It's not as bad as I thought it would be nana
18/12/2020, 15:08 - Bee: Not yet anyway
18/12/2020, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Stop thinking it'll be bad 😠. You are going to have an insanely good time with amazingly fun people and it'll be a story you'll remember forever
18/12/2020, 15:27 - Bee: It was with the couple from Canada who volunteer?
18/12/2020, 15:27 - Bee: Yes, you're right. I must stop thinking that way.
18/12/2020, 15:27 - Bee: I will try my best.
18/12/2020, 15:27 - Bee: Naaahhhh my best is rags
18/12/2020, 15:27 - Bee: I will try with God's strength
18/12/2020, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Just an agency that handles the website
18/12/2020, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: And it wasn't a couple. Just Kathryn from Canada who had interned here
18/12/2020, 16:46 - Bee: Oh
18/12/2020, 16:46 - Bee: We're about to reach Madgao
18/12/2020, 16:46 - Bee: What's up?
18/12/2020, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: I was playing a game called Celeste. Its been a while since I've played an offline platformer
18/12/2020, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: And trying to upload the videos from my phone to Drive so I can access it but I think it'll just be faster to transfer via USB
18/12/2020, 18:04 - Bee: Is it an FPS game?
18/12/2020, 18:04 - Bee: I liked the movie. Bawled my eyes out. What I learnt - when you give love, it grows
18/12/2020, 23:04 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. "Platform" game. Like Mario
18/12/2020, 23:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
18/12/2020, 23:24 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
18/12/2020, 23:32 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 06:36 - Bee: Nischal!!!
19/12/2020, 06:36 - Bee: Much much better than what I expected 😁
19/12/2020, 06:36 - Bee: Looking so cute man
19/12/2020, 06:41 - Bee: You've don't it really well ya. I'm not just saying it
19/12/2020, 06:52 - Bee: 😊🤗♥️
19/12/2020, 07:07 - Bee: 😊
19/12/2020, 07:32 - Bee: Also, we reached safely. Around 5am
19/12/2020, 07:32 - Bee: Had breakfast. Went around the fields for a bit
19/12/2020, 07:32 - Bee: Prepping lunch now. Almost done. Jason and I cooked lunch
19/12/2020, 07:32 - Bee: Pretty good for first time dishes
19/12/2020, 07:33 - Bee: I don't have network here
19/12/2020, 07:33 - Bee: I'm using Jason's hotspot. But his internet is patchy too
19/12/2020, 07:54 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 08:01 - Nischal Abraham: 😮. I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult. But my positivity will only consider that as a compliment
19/12/2020, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Thanking God for a safe journey! 😊
19/12/2020, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Woah that's awesome! What did you make?
19/12/2020, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: That's better than what I was expecting so I'm very thankful for that ☺️
19/12/2020, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>

19/12/2020, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: Emma Eliz Abraham
19/12/2020, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
19/12/2020, 08:20 - Nischal Abraham: I know your network isn't great... But I thought I should ask anyway. Would you be free for a call on the 23rd to wish Nidhi? Let me know what time suits you... Or even if it doesn't that's fine
19/12/2020, 08:31 - Bee: It is a compliment nana
19/12/2020, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: I've already forwarded the videos to Reenee as well. Just letting you know so you won't send her the same thing again
19/12/2020, 08:32 - Bee: Andhra style Dal, bangda (it's a fish) fry, and dente (don't know what English for this is. Its a leafy vegetable) bhaji
19/12/2020, 08:32 - Bee: SAME
19/12/2020, 08:32 - Bee: Photos and videos are taking so long to download. I'll make a trip to the terrace after lunch
19/12/2020, 08:32 - Bee: 23rd is the engagement... I should be free in the evening. Before that the house will be busy / I won't be home
19/12/2020, 08:32 - Bee: Is evening okay?
19/12/2020, 08:32 - Bee: Btw, is it a family call?
19/12/2020, 13:09 - Bee: Those cheeks 😍 I want to bite a piece off
19/12/2020, 14:45 - Bee: Accidentally called
19/12/2020, 17:04 - Bee: Has your phone died
19/12/2020, 18:36 - Bee: Hi bb :)
19/12/2020, 18:37 - Bee: Today went much better than expected
19/12/2020, 18:37 - Bee: I'm exhausted. But there's so much to be thankful for
19/12/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Tomorrow will be my first worship in person since lockdown. It will be in Kannada and I won't understand anything but worship is beyond languages. I'm looking forward to it
19/12/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Also, I'll have internet as long is Jason does. I'm thankful to God for that
19/12/2020, 18:38 - Bee: Hope you're alright and that you've had a good day Nischal
19/12/2020, 18:39 - Bee: Making much prayer for you. 😊
19/12/2020, 18:41 - Bee: I've updated Nidhi's birthday note on Evernote. Have a look okay?
19/12/2020, 18:43 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. ☺️
19/12/2020, 18:55 - Bee: Praying that you're alright
19/12/2020, 18:57 - Bee: I miss you bucket loads
19/12/2020, 18:57 - Bee: Bye
19/12/2020, 14:45 - Bee: Missed voice call
19/12/2020, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee. Sorry I've been disconnected all day. Went on a road trip up north with Timon today so no network
19/12/2020, 19:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'll update more later in the night. Sounds like your day's been good
19/12/2020, 19:54 - Nischal Abraham: It is. And evening is perfect cause that's when Becky is free too
19/12/2020, 23:53 - Nischal Abraham: It's been a lovely day for me. We went up north to meet Ithai, Danielle, (and Joy, Eva, Leah) that's Timon's brother's family
19/12/2020, 23:53 - Nischal Abraham: Then met up with his friends in the north (JP, Emma, Andrew McAdam, wife and kid) and had a 24" pizza for lunch
19/12/2020, 23:54 - Nischal Abraham: Well two 24" pizzas
19/12/2020, 23:54 - Nischal Abraham: Then the rest of the evening was spent at JP's house playing Exploding Kittens. James and Ruth came by for tea and we played telestrations with them
19/12/2020, 23:55 - Nischal Abraham: Drove back to reach home by 8 since Reading the Bible group meets then
19/12/2020, 23:55 - Nischal Abraham: Post that we headed over to Phil's place and played a card game called Rook till about 10 min ago
19/12/2020, 23:55 - Nischal Abraham: It's been a fun full day. Didn't have any network up north since I was roaming
19/12/2020, 23:56 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds like a good day spent 🙂
19/12/2020, 23:56 - Nischal Abraham: And I am for you too!
19/12/2020, 23:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'll check it out
19/12/2020, 23:56 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you ocean loads. And more
19/12/2020, 23:58 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you're flooded with these messages. I pray your Sunday is Spirit filled even in a place where the language may not be well understood. Your worship is between you and God then and that's okay. Reading was from 1 and 2 Corinthians which is not so surprisingly exactly about language problems in the church 😁
20/12/2020, 09:47 - Bee: Hi bb 😊
20/12/2020, 09:48 - Bee: Okay. I forwarded them too. But thanks
20/12/2020, 09:49 - Bee: Nooooo don't be sorry. I laughed out loud when I read this message. 
I assumed your phone must have conked off and I was thinking to myself What will he do now?!?!?! His new phone will take at least another 2 weeks to arrive!!!!!!!
20/12/2020, 09:49 - Bee: I also sent you a message on telegram. And sent an email as well. You can ignore those 😂
20/12/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Looking forward to it 😊 it will be the first time I'll be interacting with Becky
20/12/2020, 09:50 - Bee: Ithai and Daniel are the parents? Or is Ithai the brother?
20/12/2020, 09:51 - Bee: Wow man. Much wow
20/12/2020, 09:51 - Bee: So happy for you!!!!
20/12/2020, 09:51 - Bee: Yep sounds like you had an amazingly fun day ☺️
20/12/2020, 09:52 - Bee: It was
20/12/2020, 09:53 - Bee: Worship felt like too long. Maybe because I couldn't understand anything. Also maybe because there were two sermons
20/12/2020, 09:54 - Bee: By worship I mean the whole meeting. Not worship worship
20/12/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yes and yes. And it's Danielle
20/12/2020, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: Aww yea that would've been problematic. Well good thing that's not the case 😂
20/12/2020, 09:59 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wow. Were both the sermons not in English?
20/12/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Went out for lunch after worship. Got to meet Sharon (my youngest cousin on maa's side). Shopped for an engagement outfit for her. Then some stuff for Kevin. Exhausted now. On my way back home
20/12/2020, 10:11 - Bee: Lots of work to do once I'm home. The girl's (Avitha's, Kevin's wife-to-be) family is coming over for lunch tomorrow
20/12/2020, 10:14 - Bee: Yes Danielle
20/12/2020, 10:14 - Bee: What? Ithai is Timon's father or brother? 🤔
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Nope. Both in Kannada. There was one hymn in English
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Bee: When's your worship meeting?
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I thought you meant parents to their kids 😂. Ithai is Timon's brother
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Nischal Abraham: In 15 min
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Bee: No no. Got it now. Thanks 😂
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Leaving when?
20/12/2020, 10:15 - Bee: Praying for you 😊
20/12/2020, 10:16 - Nischal Abraham: Leaving now. Have a wonderful day! I'll talk later 🙂

20/12/2020, 12:50 - Bee: 🥺😂🥺😂🥺😂🥺😂🥺😂🥺😂🥺😂🥺🥺😂
20/12/2020, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Can't access it
20/12/2020, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: We came over to Noel and Liza's for lunch. Heather is out of quarantine!!
20/12/2020, 17:14 - Bee: It'll be there in the final video. You can watch it then. It's a link to the video Nidhi's college friends made
20/12/2020, 17:14 - Bee: Woohoooo! What plans after?
20/12/2020, 17:14 - Bee: Does that mean you're going to move back?
20/12/2020, 17:15 - Bee: Also, will you be free for a call tomorrow night? I don't know if we'll be able to hear each other. But we can try
20/12/2020, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Ah that's alright then
20/12/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Went for a drive-in carol service and just got back to Timon's place
20/12/2020, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Later tonight is the plan
20/12/2020, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: I should be. Nothing else planned so far. I'd love to try for a call 😊
20/12/2020, 19:56 - Bee: So much cooking done for tomorrow. Avitha's family is coming over tomorrow. For lunch. Some 18-20 people

21/12/2020, 18:14 - Bee: Okay

21/12/2020, 18:14 - Bee: 😊
21/12/2020, 18:41 - Nischal Abraham: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/74860403686?pwd=cUliL2J1NGlhZ2RVZVNiZnRtU2JTQT09
21/12/2020, 18:42 - Bee: I can hear you
21/12/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Hi
21/12/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Noooooo
21/12/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Joining
21/12/2020, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: Zoom!
21/12/2020, 19:23 - Bee: ❤️
21/12/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Zoom worked out pretty well
21/12/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: I'm almost inclined to just stick to that for our video calls
21/12/2020, 19:25 - Bee: We can. There's no time limit when it's just two participants
21/12/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Dude
21/12/2020, 19:25 - Bee: Creepy (?) Idea
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Have a video call on zoom. And record it. To look back after X years
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Bee: For memory's sake
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: There isn't any limit for Christmas week on Zoom
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Bee: 😮
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Regardless of participants
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wait. It's only for Christmas day
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Nischal Abraham: Nevermind 😶
21/12/2020, 19:26 - Bee: Or. We can ask each other questions or something and record that call to watch later
21/12/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Oh. There's no zoom meeting I want to be a part of on Christmas day
21/12/2020, 19:27 - Nischal Abraham: We could just record all our video calls on zoom and save it for later
21/12/2020, 19:27 - Bee: Dude I thought if this but then also thought that you may think it's a bit much
21/12/2020, 19:28 - Nischal Abraham: Na I like the idea of saving memories of conversation
21/12/2020, 19:28 - Bee: Cool. Zoom video calls it is, then. 😊
21/12/2020, 19:28 - Bee: We levelled up!
21/12/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy!!
21/12/2020, 19:29 - Nischal Abraham: I was looking for a gif to relate to but it took too long
21/12/2020, 19:29 - Bee: 😂
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: This works 😂
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Bee: Me
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Bee: Us
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Though I'd never physically show that much emotion
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Bee: I might
21/12/2020, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: I'd just implode
21/12/2020, 19:31 - Bee: 😶
21/12/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Don't nana
21/12/2020, 19:31 - Bee: What will I do then
21/12/2020, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: You explode
21/12/2020, 19:31 - Bee: Big mess for you to clean up
21/12/2020, 19:31 - Bee: What are you going to do now?
21/12/2020, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Eat something for dinner. Probably just bread again
21/12/2020, 19:32 - Bee: I'm not sleepy because of the afternoon nap. But no place other than outside our where I can talk without disturbing anyone
21/12/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Bread and?
21/12/2020, 19:32 - Bee: Or*
21/12/2020, 19:33 - Bee: On a call
21/12/2020, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Bread, cheese, ham slices, mayo
21/12/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: I need to get my other luggage bags down from the attic. Or at least take my clothes out of them
21/12/2020, 19:34 - Bee: You've set up your bedroom?
21/12/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: That's okay Bee. I don't mind just chatting
21/12/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Not a whole lot to setup
21/12/2020, 19:34 - Bee: Thank you. :)
21/12/2020, 19:35 - Bee: Ahhh. Groceries to buy?
21/12/2020, 19:35 - Bee: What about Christmas gifts and/or cards? Still on?
21/12/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: Did it this afternoon. Well not proper groceries but like emergency supplies
21/12/2020, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: Probably not 😶. I don't think I have the time to get working on that. Also Rachel McMeekin made a book of drawings and now I don't want to be making cards
21/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: Is it because she's good at drawing or something?
21/12/2020, 19:37 - Bee: I don't know the connection man
21/12/2020, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: Ah it's okay. Tough explaining it. I feel anything I do will be inferior
21/12/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: No. But the efforts of a 6yo is hard to match up to 😂
21/12/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Yep. True true
21/12/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: What's your sleeping situation? You sharing a room?
21/12/2020, 19:40 - Bee: Is that book a Christmas gift?
21/12/2020, 19:41 - Bee: Jason, Kevin, Sharon, I are sleeping in the living room. It's huge and we have a lot of space
21/12/2020, 19:41 - Bee: One room for Priya's family. The other for Jason's parents
21/12/2020, 19:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. A book of hand made drawings
21/12/2020, 19:43 - Bee: For you?
21/12/2020, 19:43 - Nischal Abraham: Are the lights out then? Won't you be disturbing people?
21/12/2020, 19:43 - Bee: Yes. No. Everyone's sleep
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: No no. For many other family friends
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Ahhhhhhhhhh
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: These kids man
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Rachel got a new guitar for herself!
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Setting the bar hi for adults
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: Christmas present. Gareth only hopes she keeps up with it
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Bee: Oh!!!!! It must be a small sized one right?
21/12/2020, 19:44 - Nischal Abraham: But she's got all the energy to want to go for it now
21/12/2020, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
21/12/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Where is she learning from?
21/12/2020, 19:45 - Bee: Rachel is 6 right?
21/12/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: There's a hymn book with chords in it. Although Gareth mentioned they'd get someone to teach her if she's really interested
21/12/2020, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
21/12/2020, 19:46 - Bee: Oh. Does she know you play the guitar?
21/12/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
21/12/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: We had a jam session last Sunday playing hymns
21/12/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: OH!!!
21/12/2020, 19:50 - Bee: You played her guitar?
21/12/2020, 19:50 - Bee: What???!!!!
21/12/2020, 19:50 - Nischal Abraham: I had a whole story of the Sunday last week where I spent all my time with the girls
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Timon and Gareth needed to discuss things about SHED so I took the girls outside
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Write the main bits down!!!!
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Or tell me how
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Now
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Oh I'll remember. Just let me know when we talk next. I'm not typing it all down now
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Bee: In their back/front yard or a day out?
21/12/2020, 19:51 - Bee: Okay cool
21/12/2020, 19:52 - Bee: I will bring it up
21/12/2020, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: Front yard. Not anywhere further out then that
21/12/2020, 19:52 - Nischal Abraham: And their tree house
21/12/2020, 19:53 - Bee: Lying down under the blanket in this cold is making me sleepy
21/12/2020, 19:54 - Bee: Imma go to sleep bb
21/12/2020, 19:54 - Bee: Goodnight, you. 😊
21/12/2020, 19:54 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Enjoy deep sleep 😊
21/12/2020, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: I loved talking to you today. Looking forward to your next selfish reason
21/12/2020, 19:55 - Bee: I have millions
21/12/2020, 19:55 - Bee: See you on Wednesday

22/12/2020, 13:59 - Bee: Brb
22/12/2020, 13:59 - Bee: I'm sorry Nischal
22/12/2020, 14:08 - Nischal Abraham: Don't be sorry. Take your time and reply tomorrow if you have to. I'm not looking for immediate replies. And it's nice to know I'm not the only one busy 😂
22/12/2020, 15:04 - Nischal Abraham: Well we finished up early for today. I'll get to my once a week violin playing
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Hey!
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: There was quite a lot of clothes ironing and hair straightening
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Early day tomorrow
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Engagement day tomor!
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Tomorrow!
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: I had to loosen my kurta because it had gotten tight 😶
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Since I came to Mangalore
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: 😶
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: What will happen until the 30tg?!
22/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Th*
22/12/2020, 19:10 - Bee: How was violin playing?
22/12/2020, 19:11 - Bee: How was your first day at work without Maggie there?
22/12/2020, 19:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/12/2020, 19:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/12/2020, 19:13 - Bee: I rode a bike today!!!!
22/12/2020, 19:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/12/2020, 19:13 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/12/2020, 19:13 - Bee: You can fast forward through the videos
22/12/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Yayy! I'm praying you enjoy your time
22/12/2020, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Congratulations!! You will achieve what I won't be able to 😂. I'm still in the habit of eating a lot since I came back from Timon's
22/12/2020, 19:33 - Bee: I don't want to weigh 60 kgs 🥺
22/12/2020, 19:33 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. 😊
22/12/2020, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'm over at Timon's and Stephens coming over for games!!!
22/12/2020, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll message you updates later in the night. Happy to see your messages 😊
22/12/2020, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: As long as your health is good and you're not just maintaining a large belly I think it shouldn't matter. 60 isn't too bad for you no?
22/12/2020, 19:39 - Nischal Abraham: Twas alright. I need to clip my nails but I seem to have lost my nail cutter 😞. Need to buy a new one tomorrow
22/12/2020, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: It's been alright. The plans for the week were laid out beforehand so it was just a matter of doing the things. But I have no one to ask the small questions anymore so just have to make a decision and go for it 😅
22/12/2020, 19:41 - Nischal Abraham: Like should I reprint labels after the names have been updated, is it alright to use a new lesson with the old one, how do I go about missing labels for the new SS group
22/12/2020, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: Why would I fast forward through the videos!? That is awesome!!!!
22/12/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: Was Sharon holding the camera while you were riding?
22/12/2020, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: Those are cute pics nana ☺️
23/12/2020, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee!! Engagement day!!!
23/12/2020, 09:05 - Nischal Abraham: And the birthday call is at 9:30pm not 9pm. Just to inform
23/12/2020, 10:26 - Bee: Woohooo! Did he stay over? Did you stay over?!
23/12/2020, 10:27 - Bee: 60 is too bad. 55 is not too bad
23/12/2020, 10:27 - Bee: Did you buy one?
23/12/2020, 10:27 - Bee: They sounds like decisions I would spend an hour making
23/12/2020, 10:28 - Bee: I know right?!???!?????!!!!
23/12/2020, 10:28 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
23/12/2020, 10:28 - Bee: Yep. She took the videos. I didn't know at first that she was taking a video. But il glad I have it. Jason wasn't home when I rode and he wasn't believing that I did
23/12/2020, 10:28 - Bee: Thank you, nana :)
23/12/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: No one stayed over anywhere. We ate pizza, played and went home
23/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: Yes!!!!! We're on our way back home
23/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: I'm tired and nauseous. Eating a heavy meal and then driving on zigzag roads isn't my thing
23/12/2020, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Not yet. I have a feeling I still have an unopened box with it in my luggage. Cause my scissors are missing too
23/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: How did you get home?
23/12/2020, 10:29 - Bee: That's it?
23/12/2020, 10:30 - Bee: This is my usual length if I'm at home. But if college or hospital, they're clipped short
23/12/2020, 10:30 - Bee: Cool. I'll keep myself free
23/12/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Well I can't be playing violin and guitar with this length. Also I keep scratching myself doing things 😶
23/12/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Stephen dropped me on his way back
23/12/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Ah. It isn't my thing either. Unless I'm sitting in the front or driving
23/12/2020, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! How'd it go?
23/12/2020, 10:34 - Nischal Abraham: I wish that was my weight bracket to fit into 😞
23/12/2020, 12:18 - Bee: Went well
23/12/2020, 12:18 - Bee: There was a lot of running around for me. Tired now
23/12/2020, 12:18 - Bee: If you were my height, sure
23/12/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Mischa
23/12/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Nischal*
23/12/2020, 12:19 - Bee: Has Reenee messaged you?
23/12/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: She messaged me yesterday for photos
23/12/2020, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: Why what up?
23/12/2020, 12:23 - Bee: Ahh
23/12/2020, 12:23 - Bee: She was going to share the link with you to share with Nidhi because I wasn't sure about my internet
23/12/2020, 12:23 - Bee: But I'm home now and I have Jason's hotspot
23/12/2020, 12:23 - Bee: She hasn't replied

23/12/2020, 18:32 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee!
24/12/2020, 09:00 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning Bee! Or afternoon. How's your day going?
24/12/2020, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the rest of the day? It's Christmas Eve! I'll be heading to Timon's later in the day. Still not sure what time but sometime after lunch
24/12/2020, 09:01 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to get on a call with you before but I don't know when or if you're free. Either way let me know 😊
24/12/2020, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: Today's agenda is to compress the video so I can share it with all the people who were involved. The original is 1.2GB and that doesn't seem very shareable 😅
24/12/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Hi!!!!!
24/12/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Replying only for this message rn
24/12/2020, 12:39 - Bee: What time will you be free for a call?
24/12/2020, 12:39 - Bee: What time will you be heading over to Timon's?
24/12/2020, 12:40 - Bee: <Media omitted>

24/12/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not too sure now... I'll let you know if I am but it'll probably be day after that we get to to talk
24/12/2020, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: That looks beautiful!!
24/12/2020, 14:15 - Bee: Okay
24/12/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: I tried sending the video but it won't send the whole thing 🙁
24/12/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: I wonder if I need to compress it even more
24/12/2020, 14:16 - Nischal Abraham: I brought it down to 150MB
24/12/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Saturday then
24/12/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Evening now 😂
24/12/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Kevin climbed up coconut trees so we drank coconut water. Slept in today. For the first time since we came. Woke up at 10
24/12/2020, 14:17 - Bee: Send it on telegram
24/12/2020, 14:18 - Bee: After lunch went for a hike. Where there are Cheetahs. So we took sickles and sticks
24/12/2020, 14:18 - Bee: It was a beautiful place
24/12/2020, 14:18 - Bee: Coming back down was difficult because it was getting dark. Everyone but me could see, as expected. I was the only one with a flashlight
24/12/2020, 14:19 - Bee: Why don't you upload it to your drive and then share the link
24/12/2020, 14:19 - Bee: That way the quality won't be compromised
24/12/2020, 14:19 - Bee: Change privacy settings so that everyone can see
24/12/2020, 14:20 - Bee: Enjoy 😊
24/12/2020, 14:20 - Bee: I've been cooking a lot more here. I'm enjoying it. Frying fish for dinner
24/12/2020, 14:21 - Bee: Avitha (Kevin's girl) is here as well. She'll be staying over tonight. We'll probably play Uno and Jenga after dinner
24/12/2020, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: Nice!
24/12/2020, 14:25 - Bee: You must be busy
24/12/2020, 14:25 - Bee: Reply later it's okay
24/12/2020, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! Did you see any cheetahs?
24/12/2020, 14:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing this now. Was trying to get it in a format that could be shared easily through WhatsApp
24/12/2020, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Did you catch the fish?
24/12/2020, 14:26 - Nischal Abraham: Game night!!! Oh those are lovely! 😊
24/12/2020, 14:27 - Nischal Abraham: Sort of. Just packing and sorting out this drive thing
24/12/2020, 14:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'll only be replying when I can. So if I don't reply when you're expecting it I'm sorry :(
24/12/2020, 14:29 - Nischal Abraham: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1TMsHvqwT4-j7Yz-6ii6XJp4oaVhz9Q9l
24/12/2020, 14:30 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know if you can view the videos in it
24/12/2020, 14:33 - Bee: When I'm clicking on Zoom call - Reaction only
It says the video cannot be played
24/12/2020, 14:33 - Bee: No problem with the other two
24/12/2020, 14:34 - Bee: Nope. We did see dried cheetah poop. Which had bits of bones inside
24/12/2020, 14:34 - Bee: Nahhhh
24/12/2020, 14:34 - Bee: It's okay nana
24/12/2020, 14:35 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's good. The one that could be afforded to be not working 😁
24/12/2020, 14:35 - Bee: Also, I rode another bike!!!!!
24/12/2020, 14:36 - Bee: And I didn't have as much difficulty like last time
24/12/2020, 14:38 - Nischal Abraham: You didn't look like you had too much difficulty last time either 😁
24/12/2020, 14:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and could you share that link with Nidhi's friends/ people you contacted for the video? I sent it to everyone I'd asked + parents + Nidhi + Reenee
24/12/2020, 14:50 - Bee: I'll do that
24/12/2020, 14:50 - Bee: Oh I had
24/12/2020, 14:50 - Bee: I don't think that part was recorded. I tried to Kickstart at least 15 times
24/12/2020, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Had a drive to Cavan and back. Timon is Christmas shopping. Hope you have a lovely day tomorrow!
24/12/2020, 18:01 - Bee: You're sleeping already?!
24/12/2020, 18:02 - Bee: We're playing Uno. It is fun
24/12/2020, 18:02 - Bee: I forgot how fun it was to play in a big group
24/12/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: I said that since I don't know when I'll get to say it later in the night
24/12/2020, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: No I'm not sleeping already... Made some Oreo icecream
24/12/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: My phone screen is dead so I can only do stuff from my laptop
24/12/2020, 18:52 - Nischal Abraham: If I suddenly switch to Telegram its cause my phone has fully conked off 😂
24/12/2020, 19:14 - Bee: Wow. With Timon?
24/12/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Oh nooooooo
24/12/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Anu update about the arrival of your new phone?
24/12/2020, 19:15 - Bee: Any*
24/12/2020, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: With his instruction and ingredients. He was busy wrapping presents
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Wow
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Bee: You made Oreo ice cream
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Bee: How does it taste? Must be good
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yes! It's dispatched. So it says 17-25 days from today
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Bee: 😮
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Its in the freezer now. It actually doesn't take a whole lot to make icecream. Just a lot of whisking
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Bee: Didn't they say 7-25 days two weeks ago
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Nischal Abraham: Or this recipe doesn't take a whole lot anyway
24/12/2020, 19:16 - Bee: No corn starch?
24/12/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: I guess that was the time for it to be dispatched
24/12/2020, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. Fresh cream and double cream
24/12/2020, 19:17 - Bee: I remember making vanilla ice cream using corn starch
24/12/2020, 19:17 - Bee: Ahhhh
24/12/2020, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure there's different ways to make different types of ice cream. Well this one is for later I'm guessing. My leftover tub of Ben & Jerry's is still lying around
24/12/2020, 19:19 - Nischal Abraham: Still playing?
24/12/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Nope. Getting ready for bed
24/12/2020, 19:23 - Bee: Goodnight, bb 😊
24/12/2020, 19:24 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Hope your sleep is restful ☺️
25/12/2020, 07:00 - Bee: It was restful sleep
25/12/2020, 07:00 - Bee: Made vadas for breakfast
25/12/2020, 07:02 - Bee: Taught Jason how to ride the bike. Then met three cutest little neighbors Joylin, Daniel, and Aiden ( Ages 8, 7, 4) who took Sharon and I around and showed us many places. I was so tired by the end. How do kids have so much of energy?!
25/12/2020, 07:02 - Bee: Now we're prepping special lunch and dinner
25/12/2020, 07:17 - Bee: Good morning, bb 😊
25/12/2020, 07:18 - Bee: I hope you have a great day of fellowship, fun, and food 😊
25/12/2020, 07:18 - Bee: Also, look at me using words that begin with the same letter
25/12/2020, 10:00 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like your day is a blast! I look forward to mine too. Won't be able to reply once I leave the house so going to be living fully in the moment
25/12/2020, 14:12 - Bee: Cool. Enjoy 😊
25/12/2020, 19:06 - Bee: Today involved a lot of playing and dancing
25/12/2020, 19:07 - Bee: Everyone's sleepy but nobody wants to stop playing
25/12/2020, 19:07 - Bee: I won the current game of Uno. It's going to take a while to get over. Imma take a nap until then
25/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: I know your day's going well. And that it involves good food 😋
25/12/2020, 19:08 - Bee: Goodnight for when you go to sleep, Nischal. 😊
25/12/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad to hear your day was fun! Mine was incredibly lovely too. I feel blessed beyond measure Bee. Ate so much at lunch that I couldn't eat anymore all day 😶
25/12/2020, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. Need Sammy to bring you down from your championship pedestal 😂
25/12/2020, 22:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry but we may not get to talk tomorrow either 😞. I'll let you know how things go in the day but there are plans for the morning to go on a walk
25/12/2020, 22:23 - Nischal Abraham: And those walk plans may not be nearby
25/12/2020, 22:27 - Nischal Abraham: I got a bunch of Christmas presents! 😭. And the house was full. There was Noel, Liza, Gareth's family, Heather, Timon, me + Mark and Hazel(Gareth's youngest sis) Rogers + their 3 kids (4,2,1ish months). Played the piano. Had good craic. Played some more games later in the night. Reached back at 10pm. I thank God for the place and people He's kept me with. Remind me to keep this attitude up especially in the worst of times. I hope your tomorrow is lovely too Bee! Praying for you always
26/12/2020, 06:48 - Bee: Helloooo Nischal 😊
26/12/2020, 06:48 - Bee: So you didn't have dinner?! Why?!?! It must have been some more good food
26/12/2020, 06:49 - Bee: 😂 nah. My pedestal will go higher
26/12/2020, 06:50 - Bee: That's okay. We'll talk whenever both of us are available 😊 is this one of those walks where you cross borders into another country?
26/12/2020, 06:50 - Bee: That's exciting! Tell me what you got. When we talk
26/12/2020, 06:51 - Bee: Who is Mark? I don't remember even if you've mentioned it before
26/12/2020, 06:51 - Bee: That's a lot of kids 😍
26/12/2020, 06:51 - Bee: I had to look up what craic meant. At first I thought it might be a native delicacy
26/12/2020, 06:52 - Bee: I thank God for that too. Will make a note of it
26/12/2020, 06:55 - Bee: Priya and fam leave today
26/12/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: It was but I wasnt hungry for anything.... There were 4 options for desert! You'd have loved it 😂
26/12/2020, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe... Maybe not... Depends on Timon's friend JP
26/12/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yep! Remember to ask me ☺️
26/12/2020, 09:54 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think I've mentioned him before. He's Hazel's husband and I first met him at STEP last Nov. So this is our second meeting
26/12/2020, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: It was! And they have unlimited energy to keep running around. I'm surprised aunty Heather could keep up as much as she did
26/12/2020, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: Haha I realised after I sent the message that I should perhaps not have used it. Its a very Irish word that has very vague meaning.... But it gets explained to you 20 times in all the orientation ceremonies in college 😂
26/12/2020, 09:58 - Nischal Abraham: Although I only understood its usage in sentences after hearing people speak... Its hard to place grammar without hearing it in normal conversation. That and the use of "grand" to describe things. And "well" to say hello. And greeting/nodding to every car  that passes you by on the road(country only)
26/12/2020, 09:59 - Nischal Abraham: It sounds like you had a lovely time with them all these days! I'll be praying for them. Since our calls are a maybe... Is there anything you'd like me to pray for?

26/12/2020, 17:57 - Bee: 4 options 🤤 I haven't had desserts here. Except for chocolates. We should switch places
26/12/2020, 17:57 - Bee: Where was the walk? How was/is it?
26/12/2020, 17:57 - Bee: I made a note nana
26/12/2020, 17:58 - Bee: .is it pronounced as creek?
26/12/2020, 17:58 - Bee: You might have to explain this to me
26/12/2020, 17:58 - Bee: Brb
26/12/2020, 17:58 - Bee: On my way back from the station
26/12/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: You'd love the cold too!
26/12/2020, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: It was in the same place as the SHED walk. It was lovely... Only strong winds and rain to accompany the 3 of us on it. So it was just Timon, Heather and me for the walk
26/12/2020, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Its pronounced crack
26/12/2020, 19:12 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing! Next time we talk hopefully
27/12/2020, 08:54 - Bee: At the moment, journey mercies for Priya and fam bit you're already praying for that
27/12/2020, 08:55 - Bee: I want me some vegetarian food Nischal. I ate a looooootttt of meat. I'm tired now. We must switch places!!!!!!
27/12/2020, 08:55 - Bee: Awwwwwee cousin time 😍
27/12/2020, 08:55 - Bee: And that baby!!!!!! 🥺
27/12/2020, 08:55 - Bee: Noel and Liza are so cute
27/12/2020, 08:56 - Bee: Why are you the only one with head gear 😂
27/12/2020, 08:56 - Bee: I love how shoes holding the little baby. ☺️
27/12/2020, 08:56 - Bee: She's******!!!!!!!!

27/12/2020, 08:58 - Bee: Worship went well. There was Christmas lunch so more non vegetarian food
27/12/2020, 08:59 - Bee: Said goodbye to Sharon as well
27/12/2020, 08:59 - Bee: The house is so empty now
27/12/2020, 09:03 - Bee: I'm soooooo tired. Been getting only 6ish hours of sleep everyday
27/12/2020, 09:03 - Bee: I'm going to take a long nap once I'm back home
27/12/2020, 09:03 - Bee: We're on our way back now
27/12/2020, 09:04 - Bee: Praying for you nana.
27/12/2020, 09:04 - Bee: Prayer matters?

27/12/2020, 15:15 - Bee: Soooo much
27/12/2020, 17:09 - Bee: Missing you bb. Just letting you know. No need to reply
27/12/2020, 17:29 - Bee: I'm off to bed
27/12/2020, 17:29 - Bee: So tired
27/12/2020, 17:29 - Bee: Going to my uncle's place tomorrow. Papa's brother's place. Where Mai is. Will be staying over for a night
27/12/2020, 17:33 - Bee: I miss you so much. Eagerly waiting for the day when I'll get to see and hug you.
27/12/2020, 17:33 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal.

27/12/2020, 22:35 - Nischal Abraham: Snowy day tonight
28/12/2020, 05:41 - Bee: So pretty
28/12/2020, 05:41 - Bee: Good morning!
28/12/2020, 05:41 - Bee: It must be freezing cold
28/12/2020, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: It was cold enough in the afternoon to freeze my nose 😂. But didn't step out long enough at night to feel very cold. And Phil and Carly's house was nice and warm for the most part
28/12/2020, 09:14 - Bee: 😂
28/12/2020, 10:34 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too Bee... I'm sorry I haven't been sending too many messages. Moved back into the office last night and between having WhatsApp only on my laptop and settling things back in the house I only got around to sharing the pics
28/12/2020, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for sharing your pictures! It looks like a wonderful, fun time!! I hope your days to come are just as fun too
28/12/2020, 10:36 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your sleepover 😊. You get to meet Mai again! I'm sure that's exciting
28/12/2020, 12:38 - Bee: It's okay nana. How's your day going?
28/12/2020, 12:38 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/12/2020, 12:38 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/12/2020, 12:38 - Bee: Dinah and Joshua
28/12/2020, 12:38 - Bee: And Mai
28/12/2020, 12:39 - Bee: I am having a wonderful time
28/12/2020, 12:39 - Bee: It's good to see and hug her
28/12/2020, 12:39 - Bee: Any update about your new phone?
28/12/2020, 13:04 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/12/2020, 13:22 - Nischal Abraham: Wow 😮
28/12/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: It should arrive sometime next month. In the meanwhile I've borrowed Gareth's old phone (that's still better than my phone 😂) to be able to call people
28/12/2020, 13:23 - Nischal Abraham: But I'm not transferring WhatsApp onto in... Just to save me the hassle of backups... Going to try transferring the backup directly from my old to new phone
28/12/2020, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: You look very comfortable here 😂
28/12/2020, 13:25 - Nischal Abraham: Been trying to get back into work today. I'm alone in the office. Annie joins tomorrow and it's going to be very busy tomorrow. If you weren't at your uncles I would've been free for a call today but I'm sure we'll have other days to talk too
28/12/2020, 14:14 - Bee: Uhhhhhhhhhhh
28/12/2020, 14:15 - Bee: When papa came here, the hen was on his shoulder for quite some time so Joshua thought that I would enjoy it too
28/12/2020, 14:15 - Bee: I thought you might be free. Because I'm not 😂
28/12/2020, 14:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/12/2020, 14:15 - Bee: <Media omitted>
28/12/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Yes, can't talk while I'm here. I've got much freedom at Jason's place
28/12/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Will you be free tomorrow night?
28/12/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Look at the joy on his face 😂
28/12/2020, 14:16 - Bee: Because holidays again?
28/12/2020, 14:41 - Nischal Abraham: Could be... Ask me again tomorrow 😊
28/12/2020, 14:42 - Nischal Abraham: Getting back to work from holidays always feels like a struggle. And it doesn't help that the office is empty 😂
28/12/2020, 16:10 - Bee: I will
28/12/2020, 16:17 - Bee: Ahh. Gareth won't be coming in either?
28/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: What was for lunch?
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: I'm off to bed
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: The little cousins have tired me out
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Let know know how your day went if you've got the time
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal 😊
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: My internet will be on because none of these messages have been sent yet. Phone will be on mute so don't worry about your messages waking anyone up
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: I'm missing you so much. Been feeling this way throughout the trip but now I finally have the time to tell you
28/12/2020, 17:17 - Bee: Bye
28/12/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: No one came in. I finished what I could do early and then went for a walk with Timon to the forest trail with his work friend
28/12/2020, 18:55 - Nischal Abraham: Rolls with cheese, ham slices, and other filling stuff I'd bought and kept
28/12/2020, 18:56 - Nischal Abraham: Kids have unlimited energy 😂
28/12/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been alright so far. I'm at Timon's place now and he's made some Asian soup for dinner so excited to try that. There's a SHED leaders meeting at 8pm so I
28/12/2020, 18:57 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just staying on here till after the meeting
28/12/2020, 18:58 - Nischal Abraham: I wish we had more opportunities to connect. But in a sense I'm glad we're busy in the places we are in... And once you're back from vacation we can sort out fixed times in the week to connect again 😊. In the meantime we'll just have to make do with whenever both of us are free
29/12/2020, 03:27 - Bee: Yep we can work out timings when things settle down 😊
29/12/2020, 03:27 - Bee: Good morning for when you see this 😊
29/12/2020, 03:28 - Bee: I hope you have a goooood day
29/12/2020, 16:28 - Bee: Hi Nischal... A call won't be possible on my end tonight :( there's packing to be done before we go to sleep. Rockey bappu and Kevin ar coming too. They have a wedding to attend
29/12/2020, 16:31 - Bee: Trying to go to bed as early as we can
29/12/2020, 16:31 - Bee: Train is at 2:30pm. I'll reach at 6am on the 31st. I have my farewell thing at college but I won't be going
29/12/2020, 16:32 - Bee: I got to meet Sharon today. Said our final goodbyes. I learnt a lot this trip. I'm glad I came. Looking forward to going back and seeing the parents. And the brother
29/12/2020, 16:39 - Bee: My time with Mai and the kids went well. I felt like I was seeing Mai for the last time. Don't know
29/12/2020, 16:40 - Bee: Praying for you and for your day to go well. And that you're able to do everything without having to call Maggie
29/12/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Is your name Grace? Because you're amazing.
29/12/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Okay done
29/12/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Tell me how your day went okay... If you've got the time. Otherwise it's okay. Maybe whenever we talk next
29/12/2020, 16:49 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal :)
29/12/2020, 23:44 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for your travels. I'm sorry its taken so long to reply to all your messages 🙁
29/12/2020, 23:45 - Nischal Abraham: I keep thinking I'll send more in the morning but by the time I start up my laptop I'm eating breakfast and then its time to get to work
29/12/2020, 23:46 - Nischal Abraham: Thanking God for the experience you got to have 😊. I'm glad you're glad!! It really is an answer to prayer to hear that
29/12/2020, 23:47 - Nischal Abraham: It's good you got to see and be with her
29/12/2020, 23:48 - Nischal Abraham: Today just ends up being one of those days I really don't feel that way. But I am eternally thankful for you Bee. Was on a call with Daniel, Paddy and Stephen tonight and God is just opening my eyes to things I've been short-sighted to
29/12/2020, 23:50 - Nischal Abraham: It was and absolutely wonderful time! We prayed for many things... and you are an important part of those many things
29/12/2020, 23:51 - Nischal Abraham: I should make more time to keep telling you how my days go. If I keep waiting for a call I'll just end up not telling you so many things that I really want you to know just cause I'll forget them. I'm confident there'll be plenty and more to fill up a conversation even after I tell you everything that's happening in my days 😂
29/12/2020, 23:52 - Nischal Abraham: And if there isn't anything else to say then we'll stay silent... I wouldn't want to do that with anyone else
29/12/2020, 23:53 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning for when you read these! I hope I haven't disturbed you with all these messages. Really hoping your phone is on silent 😶
30/12/2020, 00:25 - Bee: Yes you should make more time. Give me at least 10 minutes of your day Nischal
30/12/2020, 00:25 - Bee: We're staying silent on text. Might as well stay silent on calls
30/12/2020, 00:27 - Bee: If not 10 then at least 5. Or 2? That isn't much right?
30/12/2020, 00:32 - Bee: Even little Eliana would sense the passive aggressiveness in these messages. And she would tell me to be nice. But I don't want to be nice right now
30/12/2020, 00:35 - Bee: My phone was on silent. But I was up anyway. Woke up around 4:50 my time and couldn't fall asleep. Read your messages while you were sending them. Didn't have it in me to reply immediately. But now I feel I should have. It might have led to a short conversation
30/12/2020, 03:38 - Bee: 🏳️
30/12/2020, 03:55 - Bee: Arpitha's birthday today
30/12/2020, 09:07 - Nischal Abraham: I'll give you at least 30. Final offer
30/12/2020, 09:08 - Nischal Abraham: You're upset. Is it my replies?
30/12/2020, 09:12 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry Bee! I never want to be the reason for a bad day. I'm praying for your journey. You probably just left from there... I hope your travel will be as fun as the rest of your trip was. And there's a hug from your parents to look forward to!
30/12/2020, 09:26 - Bee: More than enough
30/12/2020, 09:26 - Bee: The lack of replies. I'm feeling neglected. I'll get over it
30/12/2020, 09:28 - Bee: It was this message which have you an idea that I might be upset?!?!
30/12/2020, 09:28 - Bee: Thank you for praying. Yes, we just left. I loaded up on movies to watch so it will be a fun travel
30/12/2020, 09:32 - Bee: Gave*
30/12/2020, 09:53 - Bee: Passive aggressiveness in my replies
30/12/2020, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: Don't get over it. If its something that I need to change then I should be the one to do something about it no?
30/12/2020, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: Messages are terribly deceiving when it comes to conveying emotion
30/12/2020, 15:18 - Nischal Abraham: Which ones?
30/12/2020, 15:19 - Nischal Abraham: I know
30/12/2020, 15:20 - Nischal Abraham: Where have you reached? How's the train journey been so far? What's the food been like?
30/12/2020, 15:46 - Bee: Okay. We can talk about it when we talk then
30/12/2020, 15:47 - Bee: Live action remake of Mulan,  The Addams family, and Wonder Woman 1984
30/12/2020, 15:47 - Bee: We crossed Madgaon. Train journey's been alright. I think each one of us has had enough socializing so we're keeping to ourselves. I get to watch my movies so I'm fine
30/12/2020, 15:48 - Bee: We had biryani from Madgaon. I had egg biryani. It was alright. Good enough for train food
30/12/2020, 15:48 - Bee: How's your day going?
30/12/2020, 15:48 - Bee: There's prayer meeting today right?
30/12/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: I haven't attended the regular meetings at Fairview since this month started. There's a 31st prayer meeting I think at 8pm which I hope to attend
30/12/2020, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be going over to Timon's place with Paddy today and order Chinese for dinner
30/12/2020, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: I've heard the live action isn't too good 😶. Haven't watched any of the others
30/12/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Though recent recommendation for a good movie was Ford vs. Ferrari that I thought I should get around to watching... Whenever I get the time to. I don't remember the last time I watched a movie
30/12/2020, 16:00 - Nischal Abraham: Egg biryani sounds nice! Though I tend to be skeptical of train food most of the time
30/12/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Busy work in the morning. But I was done by lunch. The downstairs is full as the assembly video making people are all there. Paddy is included in that group so he's over as well
30/12/2020, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Got my residence permit! He picked it up from my place in Kilcock
30/12/2020, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: We went for a walk in the forest post lunch. The sun was beautiful today! Every corner just looked like it'd fit splendidly on a postcard. And the ground was frozen over so puddles were just ice!!!
30/12/2020, 16:03 - Nischal Abraham: And some of that ice had been stepped on so the broken shards just looked like shattered glass pieces. The leaves had white linings on them. It was all just really pretty
30/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: That'll be on zoom right? Are there prayer meetings in Drum as well?
30/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: Sounds like fun! No gaming?
30/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: It was alright. If you've seen the original then this one doesn't compare
30/12/2020, 16:22 - Bee: Ahh. I haven't seen that one yet
30/12/2020, 16:23 - Bee: Cool. Will Paddy be staying over?
30/12/2020, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yep it'll be zoom. There were prayer meetings in Drum till Level 5 was announced again for the 26th
30/12/2020, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Don't know... Maybe board games... Maybe some Age of Empires(AoE). We'll see
30/12/2020, 16:24 - Bee: Is that the one that was kinda hard to apply for? Too many errors or something. Or was that for your driver's license?
30/12/2020, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: I have seen the original. Have you watched Mulan 2?
30/12/2020, 16:24 - Bee: I'm imagining a scene out of Frozen + Brave
30/12/2020, 16:24 - Bee: There's a Mulan 2?!?!?!?!?!?!
30/12/2020, 16:24 - Bee: I haven't watched that one
30/12/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: Me neither! Though Daniel's going around in his Bible college getting everyone to watch 3 idiots 😂😂. Its his all time favourite movie now
30/12/2020, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: Probably not. I'd say he's got plans for tomorrow. He's staying at home now
30/12/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: The residence permit is my 1G visa that allows me to work in Ireland for another 2 years post studies
30/12/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh Frozen is a good imagery to go by... But a very tiny scale compared to ice castle 😅
30/12/2020, 16:27 - Nischal Abraham: There is.... Don't watch it. It's not very good
30/12/2020, 16:31 - Bee: Hahahahahaha
30/12/2020, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Did you get the top bunk?
30/12/2020, 16:39 - Bee: Because Christmas break?
30/12/2020, 16:43 - Bee: Okay. Is it an animated movie?
30/12/2020, 16:43 - Bee: I did. Not the too bunk but the side upper bunk. Been up here for quite a while now
30/12/2020, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And he's on placements so the school he's teaching in is closer to home than the college
30/12/2020, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: It is. Well actually you can come to your own conclusions about it. I think for me it just didn't match up to the first one
30/12/2020, 16:48 - Bee: Oh. It must be nice to be back home 😊
30/12/2020, 16:49 - Bee: How are you?
30/12/2020, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... He's hoping to find work far from home 😂
30/12/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Worried I'm too easily losing sight of decisions I'd made
30/12/2020, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: Not the worst I've felt... And for the most part every day has many highlights in them that are an incredible blessing!
30/12/2020, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: God's being faithful as always... Me not so much
30/12/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Oh 😂 another Berachah and Daniel story
30/12/2020, 17:03 - Bee: Could you explain? If it's too much on text then you can tell me when we talk. I'll make a note of it
30/12/2020, 17:05 - Bee: As always, yes. 😊
30/12/2020, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Yea ask me on call.. It'll probably be just as confusing but at least you can stop me and tell me I'm rambling 😂
30/12/2020, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Oh that's a nice one too... Its like second best to top bunk. But its usually too small for me and I have to curl up if I want to fit there 😕
30/12/2020, 17:07 - Bee: As always, yes 😛
30/12/2020, 17:08 - Bee: I'll be turning my internet off to save battery. I've got an hour of wonder woman left and then I'll go to sleep
30/12/2020, 17:08 - Bee: Yeah that's why I'm here. Because it's smaller than the other top bunk
30/12/2020, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Can you stretch out and still fit in?
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Thank you so much for the messages, Nischal. It means  a lot to me that you did
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: I don't know if you could make out from my messages (because like you said, they don't convey the right emotions), I'm feeling a little off. I'll try explaining it when we talk. It'll be a poor attempt but I'll try to put it into words
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: I'm praying for you. And I miss you.
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: I hope you have a good time with Timon and Paddy 😊
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Goodnight, for whenever you go to sleep, Nischal.
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: You are loved and special and important.
30/12/2020, 17:18 - Bee: Bye
31/12/2020, 00:14 - Bee: I can
31/12/2020, 01:58 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for reading my messages while you're travelling 😊
31/12/2020, 01:59 - Bee: Why aren't you asleep yet?!
31/12/2020, 02:00 - Bee: We're about to reach Thane
31/12/2020, 02:00 - Bee: And something has happened to my right eye
31/12/2020, 02:00 - Bee: It might be worrying ifi send a photo so I won't until I know what it is
31/12/2020, 02:00 - Bee: Goodnight!
31/12/2020, 02:03 - Nischal Abraham: What!? I didn't notice anything at all
31/12/2020, 02:04 - Nischal Abraham: This is why I'm still up. I'll just be going back home tomorrow
31/12/2020, 02:06 - Nischal Abraham: Well we're off computers now. Goodnight! I'm praying for your eye
31/12/2020, 08:21 - Bee: Hi ☺️
31/12/2020, 08:22 - Bee: Reached home, showered, ate, talked went to the doc, now I'll use the eye drops prescribed and go to sleep
31/12/2020, 08:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/12/2020, 08:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
31/12/2020, 08:24 - Bee: God's grace that it isn't dangerous. I should be fine in a couple days. Thank you for praying nana. I was panicking in the morning because I couldn't close my eye shut
31/12/2020, 08:52 - Nischal Abraham: That looks really bad 😶. Do you know how it happened or what it is?
31/12/2020, 08:53 - Nischal Abraham: Praise God! Glad you're all safe home. Enjoy your sleep and I hope you have a lovely New Years Eve day
31/12/2020, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you nana... You rest my heart and make it race and I love that you do ☺️. Enjoy your sleep! I got 4 hours of it but a lovely fun night with Paddy and Timon!
31/12/2020, 13:11 - Bee: It's a bacterial infection. It's called Chemosis
31/12/2020, 13:19 - Bee: I hope you have a lovely New Years Eve too 😊 ours involves a zoom watchnight service which I'm looking forward to
31/12/2020, 14:30 - Bee: Highly unlikely but I want to ask anyway. Will you be free for a short call? Not more than 5 minutes... You probably won't be and that's okay too. Just thought that I should ask at least
31/12/2020, 15:30 - Bee: Hi Nischal
31/12/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Watchnight service in a minute
31/12/2020, 15:31 - Bee: Bye!
31/12/2020, 16:26 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your watchnight service! I'm over at Timons again. Paddy is still here and we're playing Settler's of Catan
31/12/2020, 17:44 - Nischal Abraham: So just medication and it'll settle down?
31/12/2020, 17:46 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I wasn't available for the call :(. I guess the watchnight service is gonna go on till midnight right?
31/12/2020, 18:42 - Bee: Yeah. It's a lot better now
31/12/2020, 18:43 - Bee: The swelling has gone down and I can close my eye shut
31/12/2020, 18:44 - Bee: There's some throbbing pain which I hope and pray will go by tomorrow
31/12/2020, 18:44 - Bee: Yep. Just got over. Don't be sorry Nischal. I knew it was unlikely for it to happen
31/12/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Happy new year, precious Nischal. 😊
31/12/2020, 18:45 - Bee: Goodnight!
01/01/2021, 02:09 - Nischal Abraham: I pray your year ahead is blessed with everything God has planned for you. And in moments where our human nature falls short, that God's grace would manifest and be abundant to fulfil His plans for you that are never determined by our ability
01/01/2021, 02:11 - Nischal Abraham: You have been a most blessed part of my life Bee... Every passing day just leaves me desiring more time with you. I wish and long for the day we finally meet and get to be awkward about it 😂. Good morning for when you read this
01/01/2021, 02:12 - Nischal Abraham: There's a possibility we'll be travelling to Stephen's farm tomorrow morning. Will have to wait and see how our sleep leaves us in the day
01/01/2021, 02:12 - Nischal Abraham: And now I'm off! Forever online in WhatsApp but not really
01/01/2021, 07:00 - Bee: *YOU* have been the most blessed part of my life, Nischal! The past year has been wonderful. It was a year of more (but not enough) talking and getting to know you, being comfortable enough to eat out loud and burp (farts coming soon) on call, a year of more (again, not enough) time spent praying together, living our lives far away but being able to share it with each other, and the best part - we got 'engaged' at heart. 
Looking forward to all that God has in store for you, me, and us (including plans for us to awkwardly meet, I'm praying). I thank God for you each day bb. 
There's much I'm yet to learn especially when it comes to being in a relationship and I'm humbly grateful to God that it's you by my side through all of it. 
Nischal, thank you for your presence, encouragement, prayer, love, patience, and silly jokes (which I secretly love) in the past year. 
I've fallen short in many aspects. Please continue to be patient and longsuffering with me as I'm chastened and moulded to be more like our Master.
Praying for you always nana.
01/01/2021, 07:00 - Bee: You'll get to meet his cows!!!
01/01/2021, 07:01 - Bee: I hope you get enough rest. But also not. Because these days won't come again
01/01/2021, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: ❤️
01/01/2021, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: I got to meet cows!!! So many cows and heifers and calves
01/01/2021, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: And sheep and lambs!
01/01/2021, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: and a dog named Suzanna and cats
01/01/2021, 14:11 - Nischal Abraham: And Witch King (Its Stephen's favourite cow. The others aren't supposed to know he has a favourite though 😂)
01/01/2021, 14:23 - Bee: 😂😂 isn't Witch King the one who featured in his video for STEP
01/01/2021, 14:24 - Bee: Yay!!!!!!!!!
01/01/2021, 14:25 - Bee: Suzanna is a fancy name for a dog
01/01/2021, 14:27 - Bee: Come to Mangalore and I'll show you more
01/01/2021, 14:33 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes it is 😂
01/01/2021, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Many of the names are used on the cows... So I guess the dog needs a fancy name
01/01/2021, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: Free for a call today?
01/01/2021, 14:34 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
01/01/2021, 15:01 - Bee: I'm at Jessy moushi's for dinner... I don't know when I'll be back
01/01/2021, 15:02 - Bee: Until what time will you be free?
01/01/2021, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free for most of the day today. Back in the office now and I don't think I'm heading anywhere tonight
01/01/2021, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be home all day. Let me know what time you are free... It's alright if you aren't I thought I should ask either way
01/01/2021, 17:34 - Bee: Oh you're working today. Have you slept enough?
01/01/2021, 17:34 - Bee: I should be back home in 30 minutes... Latest an hour
01/01/2021, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: No no not working. I meant I'm back in No 5
01/01/2021, 17:34 - Bee: Ahhhhhh
01/01/2021, 17:35 - Bee: I thought you joined work
01/01/2021, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: That's quite late for you... You sure you're up for a call?
01/01/2021, 17:42 - Bee: Yes it will be late... Tomorrow night then?
01/01/2021, 17:42 - Bee: I'm sorry :(
01/01/2021, 17:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright Bee 😊. It was a last minute ask. Hopefully tomorrow!
01/01/2021, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you had a lovely day! How's your eye now?
01/01/2021, 18:20 - Bee: Just got home
01/01/2021, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: You don't have to reply immediately
01/01/2021, 18:20 - Bee: Much much better. No longer swollen and it isn't paining anymore
01/01/2021, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh cool! I was just gonna type my string of messages for you to read later
01/01/2021, 18:21 - Bee: Looks almost normal
01/01/2021, 18:21 - Bee: Type!!!
01/01/2021, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Thanking God for that 😊
01/01/2021, 18:21 - Bee: I am too
01/01/2021, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Well I didn't know you were gonna be online. Now I have to wait till you're offline
01/01/2021, 18:23 - Bee: I asked Ashley if he would donate one of his eyeballs and he said that that I'll have to put my name on some list to get a dead body's eyeball. And that there's no need for me to take his
01/01/2021, 18:23 - Bee: Okay I'll go offline and be back in 2
01/01/2021, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: No 🙁
01/01/2021, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Don't go offline
01/01/2021, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Debbbyyyyyyyyyyy
01/01/2021, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
01/01/2021, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: !
01/01/2021, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: !
01/01/2021, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: !
01/01/2021, 18:24 - Nischal Abraham: !
01/01/2021, 18:25 - Nischal Abraham: Are you going to sleep... You must've stayed up late last night as well so it's probably for the best. I miss you so so much Bee... It's been ages since we last spoke and I want to hear all about your days in Mangalore and back
01/01/2021, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: I never really understood how you'd go about attaching another eyeball onto a person... I guess if heart's can be transplanted then why not eyeballs
01/01/2021, 18:26 - Nischal Abraham: But you said you're getting better. There should be no need for any donations 😊
01/01/2021, 18:27 - Nischal Abraham: Last night we played a bunch of board games, relaxed in front of the fireplace, watched "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel", had a zoom call Timon arranged for the evening till midnight
01/01/2021, 18:28 - Nischal Abraham: And then played another board game after that call to end the night 😂
01/01/2021, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Woke up at 9/10 in the morning today. Timon made pancakes for breakfast. Then went to Stephen's farm and sat around for tea and chats till lunch and drove back. Paddy dropped me off at the office around 2pm
01/01/2021, 18:29 - Nischal Abraham: Been here since. I felt extremely tired and sleepy around 4 but resisted going to bed since I wouldn't sleep at night then. I'll just go to bed early tonight and enjoy a nice, long alarmless sleep
01/01/2021, 18:31 - Nischal Abraham: That has been my New Years Eve. Missed talking to you though... And every event I enjoy I can't help but think I want to recreate those moments with you. Playing board games together, staying up together, making pancakes for you in the morning. I don't know if its wrong to pray for those days to come sooner but I do
01/01/2021, 18:36 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!
01/01/2021, 18:36 - Bee: I went to brush my teeth, change into sleep clothes, make my bed for the night, and apply my eye medicine
01/01/2021, 18:38 - Nischal Abraham: Alright... I'll accept that as a reason to go offline 😂
01/01/2021, 18:39 - Bee: I am going to sleep. I've got an eye ointment to apply but I just applied drops so I'm waiting for a couple minutes
01/01/2021, 18:41 - Bee: I miss you so so so much Nischal. This missingness just keeps multiplying. Each time I miss you bucket loads I think to myself-Wow, this must be the most I've missed Nischal and more than this isn't possible. But then Booom! Some more missingness the very next day
01/01/2021, 18:41 - Bee: I've never witnessed a transplant surgery. I want to. One day
01/01/2021, 18:42 - Bee: Yep I'm getting better. I wanted to know of Ashley would give me his eyeball. I got my answer 😂
01/01/2021, 18:42 - Nischal Abraham: You got the answer you expected anyway 😂
01/01/2021, 18:42 - Bee: All of this was at Timon's? How many board games does he have?! 😂
01/01/2021, 18:43 - Bee: Was it a call with STEP peeps? Or Bible reading group? Or some other people that I haven't heard of before?
01/01/2021, 18:43 - Bee: You ended the morning man
01/01/2021, 18:43 - Bee: Stephen's farm isn't too far away?
01/01/2021, 18:44 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I hope you have a lovely day tomorrow. Let me know if you want to get on a call anytime in the day post your 2pm cause I won't be up before that. Praying for you always! Especially your eye that it heals without a hitch 😊
01/01/2021, 18:44 - Bee: Wise. It was the same with me today. I was fighting my afternoon nap because I want to sleep well now
01/01/2021, 18:44 - Bee: Where are you going
01/01/2021, 18:44 - Bee: Don't go
01/01/2021, 18:45 - Bee: 😟
01/01/2021, 18:45 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not going... I thought you will be going to bed
01/01/2021, 18:46 - Nischal Abraham: I don't want you to be staying up late if you plan on sleeping
01/01/2021, 18:46 - Bee: Starred, dude. I had a similar experience in Mangalore. I wanted to share every experience with you. I missed you so much. It hurt
01/01/2021, 18:48 - Bee: Thank you for praying. We'll talk tomorrow then. I'll let you know the time tomorrow is that's okay?
01/01/2021, 18:49 - Bee: Btw I prefer banana pancakes over plain ones
01/01/2021, 18:50 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal. 😊
01/01/2021, 18:50 - Bee: ♥️
01/01/2021, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Of course! I look forward to it!! 😁
01/01/2021, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Noted
01/01/2021, 18:51 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight again!
02/01/2021, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! What's plans for the day?
02/01/2021, 11:53 - Bee: Hi bb 😊 no plans as such. I'll go for a walk now. Then there's the call with you at night. Nothing else planned
02/01/2021, 11:53 - Bee: What's your day like.
02/01/2021, 11:53 - Bee: ?
02/01/2021, 11:53 - Bee: Have you gotten enough rest?
02/01/2021, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Rested well... Haven't done a whole lot this morning
02/01/2021, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: What time do you want to get on a call?
02/01/2021, 12:22 - Bee: Is 10:30 okay?
02/01/2021, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good to me. I'll keep myself free 😊
02/01/2021, 13:27 - Bee: Looking forward to it 😊
02/01/2021, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free whenever you are
02/01/2021, 17:01 - Bee: Hi
02/01/2021, 17:01 - Bee: Give me 5 minutes
02/01/2021, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Sure thing. Take your time
02/01/2021, 17:05 - Bee: Zoom?
02/01/2021, 17:06 - Bee: Or WhatsApp call?
02/01/2021, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: Zoom
02/01/2021, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/76839423012?pwd=ZnFhSnQ3VnFxQ294ZExieFpqcUN6UT09
09/01/2021, 10:35 - Nischal Abraham: Shifted WhatsApp to the replacement phone... My old phone screen just keeps getting worse so before the touch on it goes bad and its impossible to shift files around I decided to move it
09/01/2021, 10:36 - Nischal Abraham: Only problem is my backup was till the start of this year. So missing messages for the last 9 days. Hopefully nothing I'll be too frazzled about
09/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: Oh. How long until your new one arrives?
09/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: All of your chats from years ago until new years have been backed up? Wow man
09/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: I heard from Jupiter. I have an in-person interview on Monday at 10:30am
09/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: I'm nervoy
09/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: Nervous
09/01/2021, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: The site still says 10th but I'm not too sure
09/01/2021, 10:48 - Nischal Abraham: Yep looks like it
09/01/2021, 10:49 - Nischal Abraham: Praising God!! 😱
09/01/2021, 10:50 - Nischal Abraham: Perfectly natural reaction I'd say. Is there anything you need to prepare for beforehand?
09/01/2021, 12:45 - Bee: Yes 😊
09/01/2021, 12:45 - Bee: There is. I know some. I'll ask my friends who have given interviews too
09/01/2021, 13:09 - Bee: Done with work?
09/01/2021, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't get around to PBS work... But I did get a lot of my list of things to do today done
09/01/2021, 13:10 - Nischal Abraham: And went shopping. Thought I'd walk as well since its sunny but changed my mind as soon as I stepped out the door
09/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: Got a lot done cool 😊
09/01/2021, 13:32 - Bee: I'm going out for my walk
09/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: Parents are tagging along. Bribing me with Pani puri
09/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: Yay me
09/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: Bye!
09/01/2021, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your walk 😊. So much pani puri Bee 😯
09/01/2021, 15:12 - Bee: Yeah so much Pani Puri. 😕
09/01/2021, 16:46 - Bee: Hey, can we talk tomorrow night, if you're still quarantining, and not today?
09/01/2021, 16:46 - Bee: I've had a massive headache the whole day and will try to go to bed early
09/01/2021, 16:47 - Bee: Have you watched The Promised Neverland? It's an anime TV series
09/01/2021, 16:47 - Bee: Afroz has been trying to get me to watch it for almost a year now
09/01/2021, 17:07 - Bee: I know we didn't schedule a call for today...just letting you know
09/01/2021, 17:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>
09/01/2021, 17:08 - Bee: I'll tell you the story behind these t-shirts
09/01/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: I was going to ask the same. Got Reading the Bible happening tonight and I'll probably be sorting out dinner before then
09/01/2021, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for you. Get plenty of rest and drink lots of water
09/01/2021, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't watched it but it was recommended recently to me as well. Probably the next anime I get around to watching but haven't found a lot of time to just be watching anything these days
09/01/2021, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Regardless of the story that's a lovely pic 😊
09/01/2021, 17:52 - Bee: Thank you nana. I had a cold water head bath and I'm feeling better
09/01/2021, 17:52 - Bee: Off to bed now.
09/01/2021, 17:53 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal! ☺️
09/01/2021, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Hope you have a wonderful time of worship tomorrow
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: Mumma not well please pray
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: I don't know anything
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: Papa called
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: Sammy rushed
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: Pray for the Lord's mercy please
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: By God's mercy and grace alone, mumma just had passed out in the bathroom but okay now. Sammy said he checked her bp and pulse, she seems okay.
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: Hi nana
10/01/2021, 02:48 - Bee: Ruth sent
10/01/2021, 08:08 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for them
10/01/2021, 10:46 - Bee: Leaving for Sunday school at Dharamveer Nagar. Yes, there's Sunday school!!
10/01/2021, 11:02 - Nischal Abraham: That's wonderful! Praying for you and the Sunday school. Let me know how it is
10/01/2021, 12:59 - Bee: It went well! There was a short gospel meeting for a couple parents after
10/01/2021, 12:59 - Bee: What's up?
10/01/2021, 12:59 - Bee: Quarantining? Or at Gareth's?
10/01/2021, 13:01 - Nischal Abraham: Quarantining still. Finished with the last of the lessons just now. Gonna have some lunch now
10/01/2021, 13:02 - Bee: What's for lunch?
10/01/2021, 13:09 - Nischal Abraham: Wraps with stuff in it. I was gonna make some more beef mince stuff but just realised I don't have onions so I'll have to buy those sometime later
10/01/2021, 15:15 - Bee: Cool. I'm revising stuff for tomorrow. I'm scared man
10/01/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes! That's tomorrow. I'm praying for that too!
10/01/2021, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: So many things added to prayer list and I'm glad for it 😊. How was worship today?
10/01/2021, 16:24 - Bee: Lovely. Benu uncle invited us over for worship and lunch. Little Naomi and Noah were there too so I got my sweet time with kids
10/01/2021, 16:24 - Bee: There were around 15 of us. Mini gathering. Singing and praying with so many voices around was lovely
10/01/2021, 16:24 - Bee: This might be the norm for a while. Tiny house churches
10/01/2021, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: You call it tiny but I'm telling you that's a full church size. Glad you had a lovely time 😊
10/01/2021, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Is it okay if we get on a call tomorrow? Planned a call with family today and I'm not sure if I'll be done anytime early.
10/01/2021, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: What time is your interview going to be?
10/01/2021, 16:48 - Bee: Yes. Tomorrow is fine 😊 enjoy your call with fam!
10/01/2021, 16:49 - Bee: It is at 10:30am
10/01/2021, 17:03 - Bee: How was your day? How are you? Let me know when you've got time. No hurry
10/01/2021, 17:03 - Bee: Goodnight, Nischal ☺️
10/01/2021, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: I woke up this morning to a very cold building. The boiler had some issue but it just needed a restart so the house was warm enough after that. Had a lovely time in the morning with singing praises and listening to the message by Sean from Drum
10/01/2021, 18:06 - Nischal Abraham: Did some packaging of lessons since Heather was coming around the office in the evening to pick them up to go North
10/01/2021, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Had lunch... Then it was such a nice relaxing day I decided I could watch a movie. So I started Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara but its a longer movie than I anticipated and it was 5 before I was halfway through
10/01/2021, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: Now just finished a call with fam! Nidhi is sharing the gospel with a friend of hers and she was worried before getting on a call with said friend. Nikhil and I were just chatting with her about that
10/01/2021, 18:09 - Nischal Abraham: It was quite nice to have the whole family on call today 😊. Nikhil won't be travelling to India but to Bahrain... I'll explain the details when we talk tomorrow. Much news to be prayed for within the family
11/01/2021, 07:20 - Bee: Oh wow. Will be keeping her in prayer
11/01/2021, 07:20 - Bee: Looking forward to it 😊
11/01/2021, 07:24 - Bee: I got selected at Jupiter. But I can't start until I've applied for registration
11/01/2021, 07:24 - Bee: And I'll get a certificate of experience only after two years
11/01/2021, 07:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's wonderful news you got selected!! 😱
11/01/2021, 07:52 - Nischal Abraham: Is that in line with your plan? Will you be going ahead with it?
11/01/2021, 07:55 - Bee: It is not. I don't know yet
11/01/2021, 07:55 - Bee: Please pray for clarity Nischal
11/01/2021, 07:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying. It's nice that you have some time till your registration to pray about it
11/01/2021, 08:05 - Bee: Yes I'm relieved I have until then to decide
11/01/2021, 08:05 - Bee: 😫
11/01/2021, 08:14 - Nischal Abraham: Trust in the Lord , and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness. 
Delight yourself also in the Lord , And He shall give you the desires of your heart. 
Commit your way to the Lord , Trust also in Him, And He shall bring it to pass.
Psalms 37:3‭-‬5 NKJV

I had this for my reading this morning. The focus was more on v3 and v5 than the commonly known v4. TRUST, COMMIT, TRUST. It was called a trust sandwich so enjoy it as you would a meal 😁
11/01/2021, 08:54 - Bee: Trust sandwiches are hard to swallow man
11/01/2021, 08:54 - Bee: Thank you for the verse. I need to spend much time praying
11/01/2021, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: You up for a call today?
11/01/2021, 16:40 - Bee: Mind if I take a rain check? Massive headache today too. I took a paracetamol
11/01/2021, 16:40 - Bee: I don't know if it's because of my food or insufficient water intake or something else
11/01/2021, 16:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yea sure. We can talk later. Is it really bad? Is it cold related?
11/01/2021, 16:42 - Bee: I don't have a cold. I don't feel like I'm going to have one either
11/01/2021, 16:42 - Bee: I don't know if it's my sleep. Too much or too little? Too much for sure
11/01/2021, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe too little? Might be the stress
11/01/2021, 16:43 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying you get better Bee 🙁. Sleep early tonight
11/01/2021, 16:43 - Bee: Maybe
11/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: Yes I'll sleep early tonight. I'm done with dinner
11/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: Went for a walk because I thought it might be because of the lack of fresh air. But it hasn't made a difference
11/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: How are you nana?
11/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: Hows your day been?
11/01/2021, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Don't spend all your time on the phone. I'll message you later tonight with details of the day
11/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: Okay 😊
11/01/2021, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Take care Bee! I'm worried for you but I hope it's nothing big.
11/01/2021, 16:45 - Bee: Goodnight then :))))
11/01/2021, 16:45 - Bee: I sleep early and wake up early. Hopefully it'll gone in the morning
11/01/2021, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight and hope you get a full night of sleep and rest 😊
11/01/2021, 16:46 - Bee: Be*
11/01/2021, 16:46 - Bee: I shall
11/01/2021, 16:46 - Bee: You too nana
11/01/2021, 16:46 - Bee: 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
11/01/2021, 16:46 - Nischal Abraham: Byeee
12/01/2021, 08:12 - Nischal Abraham: Hii! Hope you're feeling better today
12/01/2021, 08:14 - Nischal Abraham: My day yesterday was just making decisions at work since I was back in the office. Practiced some violin after and didn't really do much else till the end of the day
12/01/2021, 08:15 - Nischal Abraham: Not so great this morning. Didn't sleep well even though I slept at 11
12/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: Hi Nischal
12/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: I was feeling alright in the morning but my head feels heave now
12/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: Heavy*
12/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: Is it covid again?! 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
12/01/2021, 10:47 - Bee: My temperature is alright though
12/01/2021, 10:48 - Bee: How come? You kept waking up? Or had a bad dream?
12/01/2021, 10:48 - Bee: Papa is on his way to the airport. Going to Mangalore. Mai isn't feeling too well and asked all her kids to visit her
12/01/2021, 11:40 - Nischal Abraham: I hope not. Is your taste or smell affected? Is anyone else in the house feeling down as well?
12/01/2021, 11:41 - Nischal Abraham: Kept waking up yea... Don't remember my dreams
12/01/2021, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! Will be adding this to prayer as well
12/01/2021, 13:35 - Bee: Nope senses of taste and smell are still there. Nobody else in the house is down
12/01/2021, 13:36 - Bee: Must be a cold then
12/01/2021, 13:36 - Bee: What's up?
12/01/2021, 13:36 - Bee: Call tonight?
12/01/2021, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: I'd like that. Not too busy a day today so I hope I'll be done by 5
12/01/2021, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: Is that alright with you?
12/01/2021, 13:40 - Bee: Yep. I should be free by then
12/01/2021, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! We can make it a short call if you want to head to bed early
12/01/2021, 15:22 - Bee: Yeah... I took a paracetamol. I should feel better in a few
12/01/2021, 15:25 - Nischal Abraham: We could be on an audio call if you don't want to be looking at a screen. Well let me know if at any point you're not feeling up to it. I'll be free at your 10:30pm
12/01/2021, 15:33 - Bee: Oh yes please. Audio call sounds good. On zoom or WhatsApp? I'll be free at my 10:30 as well
12/01/2021, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know. If it's zoom then we can record, but WhatsApp will be easier for an audio call. I don't mind either way now that I have WhatsApp on the phone
12/01/2021, 16:34 - Bee: WhatsApp then?
12/01/2021, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: 👍. Give me 10 min
12/01/2021, 16:56 - Bee: Okay
12/01/2021, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
12/01/2021, 17:12 - Bee: Hi
12/01/2021, 17:12 - Bee: I'll call?
12/01/2021, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
12/01/2021, 19:21 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
13/01/2021, 08:43 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee :). How was your morning drive?
13/01/2021, 09:00 - Bee: Good morning nana! ☺️
13/01/2021, 09:00 - Bee: There was no morning drive. Rolf had to go to work and he took the car
13/01/2021, 09:01 - Bee: I got the bank work done. Need to look into classes for IELTS
13/01/2021, 09:01 - Bee: Mai is doing much better. She was given CPR yesterday
13/01/2021, 09:01 - Bee: She's alright now. Papa will leave tomorrow. Returning by train
13/01/2021, 09:02 - Bee: What are you going to do today?
13/01/2021, 09:02 - Bee: My head feels heavy. It's definitely a cold. Took steam once in the morning. Will take again. Been drinking warm water since morning
13/01/2021, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't CPR for emergencies? Is there an application I'm unaware of?
13/01/2021, 09:38 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Praying for a safe journey
13/01/2021, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no... Did you go for a walk then? Or just didn't meet at all
13/01/2021, 09:40 - Nischal Abraham: Okay... If the timings don't work out for classes and work then don't worry. I think you can get by with studying yourself.... Unless you are also one of those people who can't get themselves to spend time studying without external forces 😂
13/01/2021, 09:41 - Nischal Abraham: Calling the bank, Calling Ruth, Updating my CV and job applying, planning the SHED activity for next week
13/01/2021, 09:42 - Nischal Abraham: Good on you for taking steam. Praying you get better Bee! If we do get on a call tonight I'm setting a hard limit of 12am for you. That's only if you're free and feeling alright...
13/01/2021, 10:13 - Bee: Yes it's for emergencies
13/01/2021, 10:13 - Bee: She had a heart attack and was revived after CPR
13/01/2021, 10:13 - Bee: Didn't meet at all. Will go tomorrow if my cold settles a bit
13/01/2021, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Oh! That sounds bad. I mean its good that she's better now
13/01/2021, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool cool. Rest well. Its been raining all morning here
13/01/2021, 10:18 - Bee: I can do without classes too. Everyone who I know and have gone as nurses have told me that classes aren't required. The Council gives some material once I register for the test right? Do you think that's sufficient?
13/01/2021, 10:19 - Bee: Yeah. We can start early. I would've asked for a call now but I've taken a medicine which makes me feel drowsy
13/01/2021, 10:19 - Bee: 12am pakka.
13/01/2021, 10:19 - Nischal Abraham: I found it to be more than enough. They give you the official book which if you manage to go through all of it before the test I think you'll be more than prepared. And there's a ton of resources online. I believe the only advantage to coaching classes is the regularity of studying that they'll enforce
13/01/2021, 10:19 - Bee: Yes she's better. Video called her in the morning and she laughed at my terrible jokes
13/01/2021, 10:21 - Nischal Abraham: What're you up to now? Gonna take a nap?
13/01/2021, 10:21 - Bee: Ruth said the same thing. Spoke to her in the morning after a long long time. She said the material that comes with registration is enough
13/01/2021, 10:22 - Bee: Yes I'll take a nap. I don't want to but I've taken a pill. And I know I'll fell better once I'm up
13/01/2021, 10:22 - Bee: Feel*
13/01/2021, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool... Enjoy your nap! 😊. Hope you feel better when you're up
13/01/2021, 10:23 - Bee: I hope so too
13/01/2021, 10:24 - Bee: What are you doing?
13/01/2021, 10:24 - Bee: How are you?
13/01/2021, 10:24 - Bee: You must have had breakfast
13/01/2021, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Done with breakfast... I'll call Ruth in half an hour
13/01/2021, 10:24 - Bee: Cool
13/01/2021, 10:25 - Bee: If Norah is around all e her to show you her Panda car. That's her favourite plaything atm
13/01/2021, 10:25 - Bee: Ask her*the
13/01/2021, 10:25 - Bee: Ask her*
13/01/2021, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: Doing well today 😊. Hope to spend some time studying as well
13/01/2021, 10:25 - Bee: Zechariah?
13/01/2021, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: Will do. I'm curious about the Panda car myself now
13/01/2021, 10:26 - Nischal Abraham: Isaiah
13/01/2021, 10:26 - Bee: Oh. Isaiah. Got it
13/01/2021, 10:26 - Bee: I'm gonna 😴
13/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: Ttyl nana
13/01/2021, 10:27 - Nischal Abraham: Goodbye!
13/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: My nap and pill leave me feeling much better
13/01/2021, 14:05 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear it 😊
13/01/2021, 15:30 - Bee: And the stuffed sinuses are back 😂 spoke too soon
13/01/2021, 15:30 - Bee: Called Ruth?
13/01/2021, 15:30 - Bee: What's up!
13/01/2021, 15:30 - Bee: ?*
13/01/2021, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't called Ruth. Norah was napping and Ruth said she'll call me for sure 😂
13/01/2021, 15:31 - Nischal Abraham: Finished with lunch. Its another rainy day so another lazy afternoon
13/01/2021, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: What are you upto?
13/01/2021, 15:38 - Bee: My call with Ruth ended because she was getting another call. She promised she'd call me back. Haven't received any call yet 😂
13/01/2021, 15:39 - Bee: I'm having dinner. Maa made pasta
13/01/2021, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: White sauce? Red sauce?
13/01/2021, 15:39 - Bee: Can we get on a call at my 11? Ruth and Reenee asked for a call. There are a few matters to be prayed for
13/01/2021, 15:40 - Bee: White
13/01/2021, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: That's fine by me
13/01/2021, 16:27 - Bee: Nana
13/01/2021, 16:28 - Bee: RR call rescheduled for tomorrow morning
13/01/2021, 16:28 - Bee: I'll be free in 10
13/01/2021, 16:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free in 10
13/01/2021, 16:29 - Bee: Okay
13/01/2021, 16:55 - Bee: Hi
13/01/2021, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
13/01/2021, 16:57 - Bee: I'll call?
13/01/2021, 16:57 - Bee: Zoom or WhatsApp?
13/01/2021, 16:58 - Bee: Video call is fine by me
13/01/2021, 16:58 - Bee: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/74702600747?pwd=WTdtSnhLZjhCR1pIcEpDYThtT0RyZz09
13/01/2021, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/60n7ZP3Cj-4
13/01/2021, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: If you're interested
13/01/2021, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
14/01/2021, 08:00 - Bee: Yes definitely not a teenager
14/01/2021, 08:00 - Bee: More like a 30 year old man
14/01/2021, 08:00 - Bee: Noted
14/01/2021, 08:00 - Bee: Nana
14/01/2021, 08:00 - Bee: Please pray for Rolf. For much wisdom
14/01/2021, 08:00 - Bee: There's a lot going on in his life. I'll give you details later
14/01/2021, 08:01 - Bee: Please pray that he stands firm and makes the right decision
14/01/2021, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: Prayed and continue to do so
14/01/2021, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: How are you today?
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: Almost completely fine 😊
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: I can breathe through my nostrils!!!
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: Nostril* because one is always shit
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: What
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: No
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: Shut****!!!!!!!
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: What's up?
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: How are you?
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: At work?
14/01/2021, 10:27 - Bee: Obviously at work
14/01/2021, 12:45 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I'm at work. Busy day today
14/01/2021, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm doing well! Somehow no matter how much I sleep I still feel tired in the morning
14/01/2021, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: It must be all the eating and lack of exercise. Did you go for a drive today?
14/01/2021, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free for a call at our usual time. I'll finish up by 5
14/01/2021, 13:54 - Bee: That's why is rather sleep 5 hours and wake up tired
14/01/2021, 13:55 - Bee: Didn't. Woke up and called Reenee but her phone was switched off. By the time she woke up, I was asleep 😛
14/01/2021, 13:55 - Bee: Were going after dinner tonight
14/01/2021, 13:55 - Bee: If the drive happens, it might be a while for me
14/01/2021, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Haha. It works if you're doing something for the rest of the hours that isn't just YouTube
14/01/2021, 13:56 - Bee: Latest my 11
14/01/2021, 13:56 - Bee: Yeah. I took an afternoon nap
14/01/2021, 13:59 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. Let me know whenever you're free. Not like I'll fall asleep if you're late
14/01/2021, 14:00 - Bee: 😂
14/01/2021, 14:00 - Bee: Yes. I'll let you know
14/01/2021, 14:00 - Bee: There's Bible study now
14/01/2021, 14:00 - Bee: Ttyl bb 😊
14/01/2021, 14:01 - Nischal Abraham: Bye! Have fun
14/01/2021, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hello... I'm done for the day... Free whenever you are
14/01/2021, 17:35 - Bee: Hi nana
14/01/2021, 17:35 - Bee: Brb
14/01/2021, 17:35 - Nischal Abraham: Okay

14/01/2021, 17:38 - Bee: ?*
14/01/2021, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Yep

14/01/2021, 20:14 - Bee: Please pray Sammy is able to finish his work.. it's important project and not be an all nighter
14/01/2021, 20:14 - Bee: Last week was very hectic
14/01/2021, 20:14 - Bee: He hardly slept
14/01/2021, 20:15 - Nischal Abraham: Will be praying
15/01/2021, 09:33 - Bee: Hi nana
15/01/2021, 09:33 - Bee: The interview went well. I got selected
15/01/2021, 09:33 - Bee: There was an HR meeting going on so I'll have to go in on Monday and meet then and fill in paperwork
15/01/2021, 09:33 - Bee: Goood morning!
15/01/2021, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Congratulations!! Praise God 🎊🥳🥳
15/01/2021, 13:06 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the day?
15/01/2021, 13:29 - Bee: Sisters' meeting just got over. No extended family meeting today because many are busy
15/01/2021, 13:29 - Bee: No other plans
15/01/2021, 13:29 - Bee: What's up!
15/01/2021, 13:29 - Bee: ?*
15/01/2021, 13:29 - Bee: I'll crochet a bit. Because I'd I'm not doing anything I'll end up binge watching YouTube videos
15/01/2021, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool! Was working in the morning. Spoke to Jacques for a while
15/01/2021, 13:30 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished with lunch and since you're done with sisters meeting I'll try and call Ruth
15/01/2021, 13:30 - Bee: Wait
15/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: Request you all to please pray for Norah as she just swallowed a coin.we are heading to the emergency
15/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: 4:41pm
15/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: Ruth sent
15/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: Thanks for prayers.
The x-ray shows that the coin is in the esophagus (food pipe), it can be taken out by endoscopy. Only the sedation requires 5-6 hours fasting so it can't be removed now.
The plan is that we do an x-ray again at 9pm; if the coin is still in the esophagus, it will be removed tonight, if it has passed into the stomach, it will be removed tomorrow morning.

Norah is doing fine, she is just scared.
Please continue to pray🙏
15/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: 6:12pm
15/01/2021, 13:31 - Bee: They must be back but still worried. Don't know if she'll be up for a call
15/01/2021, 13:32 - Bee: Message and ask no
15/01/2021, 13:32 - Bee: She wasn't there for sisters meeting
15/01/2021, 13:32 - Bee: She might be busy with Norah
15/01/2021, 13:32 - Bee: Sent on Bethesda sisters' group
15/01/2021, 13:33 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wow. She'd called in the morning but I guess that was before this happened
15/01/2021, 13:33 - Bee: Yes
15/01/2021, 13:33 - Nischal Abraham: Hope Norah is okay :(
15/01/2021, 13:33 - Bee: Happened around 4:30
15/01/2021, 13:34 - Bee: She'll be fine nana. These things keep happening with toddlers
15/01/2021, 13:35 - Nischal Abraham: Do you see a lot of these cases when you were working?
15/01/2021, 13:35 - Bee: Yes yes
15/01/2021, 13:36 - Bee: Foreign objects in the ears, up the nose, and down the throat is common
15/01/2021, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: Fun times for the parents I'd say. Did I tell you of the time Nidhi put stuff in her ear?
15/01/2021, 13:38 - Bee: No?
15/01/2021, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: Really!? I was almost sure I had. Well I'll tell you on a call sometime then
15/01/2021, 13:38 - Bee: Tell me when we talk next. I'll tell you about the time Reenee put stuff up her nose
15/01/2021, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
15/01/2021, 13:38 - Bee: I wasn't there when it happened. Wasn't even born. But she told me much later
15/01/2021, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: What have you done?
15/01/2021, 13:39 - Bee: Whaaaa?
15/01/2021, 13:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just asking if you've put stuff where they shouldn't be
15/01/2021, 13:41 - Bee: Ahhhhhhh
15/01/2021, 13:41 - Nischal Abraham: Though is a coin harmful if it passes into the stomach?
15/01/2021, 13:42 - Bee: Just asked my parents. They said I didn't!!!!!!
15/01/2021, 13:42 - Bee: And Ashley didn't either
15/01/2021, 13:42 - Bee: No it isn't. If it's a small coin, it will leave her body via poop. If it's a larger one then it has to be removed through the scope
15/01/2021, 13:43 - Bee: Nothing to worry about
15/01/2021, 13:43 - Bee: But a parent's job is to worry. And Norah must be scared too. Looking at everyone's reaction
15/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: Ruth replied saying Norah wants to talk to Joanne. Which means she must be fine no?
15/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: On the Sisterhood group
15/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: Reenee Ruth I
15/01/2021, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: Norah must just be scared. Though scared is good. It means she wouldn't want to do it again I hope
15/01/2021, 13:44 - Bee: Maybe call with Ruth might happen?
15/01/2021, 13:45 - Bee: 😂. One can never tell with kids
15/01/2021, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Ah it's cool. I sent her a message. If she's up for it she'll call back
15/01/2021, 14:11 - Bee: Cool cool
15/01/2021, 14:11 - Bee: I'm eating banana chips that papa brought from Mangalore. They're fried in coconut oil. My favourite kinda banana chips
15/01/2021, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good! Are we getting on a call tonight?
15/01/2021, 14:13 - Bee: Are you free for a call?
15/01/2021, 14:13 - Bee: You've got so many people to talk to
15/01/2021, 14:13 - Bee: Scheduled ones, I mean
15/01/2021, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: I will be. So many people to talk to should finish up before I think
15/01/2021, 14:14 - Bee: Alright. 10:30ish then? I'll let you know if I'm free before that!
15/01/2021, 14:14 - Bee: ?*

15/01/2021, 19:08 - Bee: Look at her little potato face 🥺
15/01/2021, 19:08 - Bee: That's alright. Wondering if it's Love or Faith or Joy or something like that. That's all
15/01/2021, 19:08 - Bee: Because this one is Hope
15/01/2021, 19:08 - Nischal Abraham: I think its Rachel Elizabeth and Eva ....

15/01/2021, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I don't know if its the same Elizabeth being referred to
15/01/2021, 19:09 - Bee: Timon is an uncle to another little girl!!!!!!!!
15/01/2021, 19:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'll decline holding a newborn 😂
15/01/2021, 19:09 - Bee: Noel and Liza have 6 grandkids now!!!!!!!!!!
15/01/2021, 19:10 - Bee: Hannah's Elizabeth is from Elizabeth Elliot. You told me I remember
15/01/2021, 19:10 - Nischal Abraham: Yes!!
15/01/2021, 19:10 - Bee: They're the easiest to hold. They don't move at all
15/01/2021, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think their movement is the reason I can't hold a baby Bee
15/01/2021, 19:11 - Nischal Abraham: Well anyway that just came in and I was excited.. Sorry for keeping you up
15/01/2021, 19:12 - Bee: You can't hold a baby bee? 🐝?
15/01/2021, 19:12 - Bee: Why would you want to hold a baby bee?
15/01/2021, 19:13 - Bee: I'm excited too. You didn't keep me up. I'm getting comfortable in the bed
15/01/2021, 19:13 - Bee: Goodnight! 😊
15/01/2021, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Getting you excited sounds like me keeping you up 😂
15/01/2021, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: I can't. That's what I'm telling you nana
15/01/2021, 19:13 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight!!
16/01/2021, 06:47 - Bee: Dear ones 
Thank you all for prayers.
Update: In morning's x-ray (fluoroscopy), it wasn't clear if the coin is in the stomach or in the intestine (as they are overlapping); so they administered sedation and put the scope; they found that the coin has just moved into the intestine; now we wait for it to come out in the stools.

We are waiting for Norah to come out of sedation and then we go home.(approx an hour)

Thanks for praying, Praise be to God for safety 🙏🏼
16/01/2021, 06:48 - Bee: - Ruth
16/01/2021, 06:48 - Bee: Goood morning bb 😊

16/01/2021, 09:16 - Bee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wSCs6wtI78
16/01/2021, 09:17 - Bee: I love this song and video
16/01/2021, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: ♥️
16/01/2021, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: That put a smile on my face in the morning 😊
16/01/2021, 10:29 - Bee: It out a smile on my face in the afternoon
16/01/2021, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: So what've you been upto?
16/01/2021, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: How's your day going?
16/01/2021, 10:32 - Nischal Abraham: How are you?
16/01/2021, 10:32 - Bee: More questions?
16/01/2021, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: No?
16/01/2021, 10:37 - Bee: Woke up at 6:30. Dropped Ashley off at the turf in Dhokali. New place for me so I got lost for a bit on my way back. Found my way out into the highway eventually. Came home and slept for two hours. Woke up at 9. Inhaled some steam because my heads been feeling heavy. Ate breakfast and crocheted for a bit. I was able to crochet a bit of the granny square! Will try to finish one by tonight. After that I watched a movie (Alita : Battle angel). Then had lunch and cleaned the kitchen. Binge watched all of Us The Duo's videos while having lunch
16/01/2021, 10:37 - Bee: And now I'm going to the MTNL office to pay a bill
16/01/2021, 10:37 - Bee: Going alright. Quite relaxed
16/01/2021, 10:37 - Bee: I'm alright nana. I have to wash my hair tonight so looking forward to the long shower after I'm back
16/01/2021, 10:37 - Bee: ?
16/01/2021, 10:37 - Bee: ?
16/01/2021, 10:38 - Bee: ?
16/01/2021, 10:39 - Nischal Abraham: Just done with breakfast... I ended up reading some of my old entries in my journal in the morning which reminded me of things I'd been thinking about. Feeling inspired to play some guitar today. But first violin practice that has been dearly neglected this week
16/01/2021, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: Its only just begun. So far its been good... Sleep was heavy on me and I'm glad I only set my alarm for 8:30 today. I'll be correcting L3's as well later
16/01/2021, 10:41 - Nischal Abraham: Excellent. Its a rainy day outside which makes for lazy days but I don't feel lazy yet so that's a good sign
16/01/2021, 10:42 - Nischal Abraham: Did he wake you up or did you wake up on your own? Granny square coming through!! 😊. 
How was the movie?
16/01/2021, 10:43 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. More driving opportunities 😂
16/01/2021, 10:51 - Bee: Papa came home from work two minutes ago and said that the office closes at 2 😂. But in my defense, Google said it's open until 5:30
16/01/2021, 10:52 - Bee: So no driving opportunity
16/01/2021, 10:52 - Bee: Ashley woke me up. And everyone was surprised how quick I was to wake and get up. Only because driving was involved
16/01/2021, 10:52 - Nischal Abraham: So next time you go walking you have to wake Ashley up
16/01/2021, 10:53 - Bee: The movie was good for the most part. I'm not very happy with the ending. Have you seen it? Apparently there's going to be a sequel
16/01/2021, 10:54 - Bee: Entries from your initial months in Ireland? It's nice to look back no. Almost makes me want to journal
16/01/2021, 10:55 - Bee: If there is a next time
16/01/2021, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: Haven't seen it. The cgi didn't look appealing to me
16/01/2021, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: Yep... It was nice looking back
16/01/2021, 10:56 - Nischal Abraham: There will obviously be a next time... Maybe not anytime soon
16/01/2021, 11:14 - Bee: Yeah. They could've done that better. Took me some time to get used to looking at Alita
16/01/2021, 11:17 - Nischal Abraham: It looked like she has a permanent camera filter on
16/01/2021, 13:13 - Bee: 😂
16/01/2021, 13:13 - Bee: Now that I think about it, that's exactly what she looked like
16/01/2021, 13:57 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/01/2021, 13:57 - Bee: In front of Lok Hospital
16/01/2021, 13:58 - Nischal Abraham: Woah! When did this plan come in place?
16/01/2021, 13:58 - Bee: Almost a year ago
16/01/2021, 13:59 - Bee: I remember it was mentioned as a prayer matter before covid. The official paperwork was delayed because of covid and that's why it took so long to start
16/01/2021, 13:59 - Bee: It's a two storey building. Ground floor will be Neev, upstairs our assembly hall
16/01/2021, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: That's awesome!
16/01/2021, 14:42 - Bee: It is
16/01/2021, 14:42 - Bee: https://youtu.be/vs7XB5X1U48 ♥️
16/01/2021, 14:46 - Nischal Abraham: You binging on Us the Duo?
16/01/2021, 15:08 - Bee: I am
16/01/2021, 15:08 - Bee: I want a photo of yours to keep in my wallet okay
16/01/2021, 15:08 - Bee: Passport sized one will do
16/01/2021, 15:09 - Bee: I'll give you mine. Even though you haven't asked
16/01/2021, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: You could print out a phone of mine you already have
16/01/2021, 15:10 - Bee: I could do that
16/01/2021, 15:14 - Bee: Do you have a photo preference
16/01/2021, 15:14 - Bee: Will you send a photo please
16/01/2021, 15:14 - Bee: Pleeeeeeease
16/01/2021, 15:14 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/01/2021, 15:22 - Nischal Abraham: Will do
16/01/2021, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hello! Sorry I was on a call with parents so my replies were minimal
16/01/2021, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: You sure you want just a passport photo of me?
16/01/2021, 15:57 - Bee: Don't be sorry. No replies would've been fine too
16/01/2021, 15:58 - Bee: Yep
16/01/2021, 15:59 - Bee: Isn't that an OG romantic thing. Passport size photos in wallets
16/01/2021, 15:59 - Nischal Abraham: Do you just wanna do what everyone else does or have something entirely unique to you?
16/01/2021, 16:00 - Bee: Both
16/01/2021, 16:00 - Bee: I'll use the photo that I added in the PPT for Sammy and Ruth
16/01/2021, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Alright... As good a photo of mine as any I say
16/01/2021, 16:01 - Bee: Unless
16/01/2021, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'll see what I have

21/01/2021, 12:19 - Nischal Abraham: BEE! WHAT IS YOUR MOVIE DOING TO ME!?
21/01/2021, 12:41 - Bee: 😂

21/01/2021, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know how cute you'd consider a mouse when you have to pick it up after
21/01/2021, 12:58 - Nischal Abraham: Your movie is sad!
21/01/2021, 13:18 - Bee: Tell me it wasn't cute and that you didn't feel like petting it
21/01/2021, 13:19 - Bee: Yeah. I was feeling low after I'd watched it. But the songs were nice no. They're available on Spotify
21/01/2021, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: I didn't feel like petting it
21/01/2021, 13:20 - Bee: And it's a true story. The crutches in the movie are real Zach's real crutches
21/01/2021, 13:21 - Bee: And his bedspread, the red plaid shirt he wore while recording, etc. are all actuals ones that belonged to Zach
21/01/2021, 13:21 - Nischal Abraham: I know it's a true story. Went on YouTube to find the original videos

22/01/2021, 17:06 - Bee: I woke up at 7 and didn't sleep during the day
22/01/2021, 17:06 - Bee: Even if we do get on a call, I'll most likely be zoning out :(
22/01/2021, 17:06 - Bee: Tomorrow night please?
22/01/2021, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Sure sure. No problem Bee

22/01/2021, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Yay! 😂
22/01/2021, 17:12 - Bee: Full day of work?
22/01/2021, 17:12 - Bee: It means my tretinoin ointment is working right? 🤔 I hope so. I don't want all these pimples for nothing
22/01/2021, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: No no. Just worked a bit in the morning, then went to the shops to get some stuff. Wasted a lot of the afternoon playing Chess 😶
22/01/2021, 17:13 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yes. Stage 1. That's actually good news then
22/01/2021, 17:14 - Bee: Ahhh. None of the 3 are available to play?
22/01/2021, 17:14 - Bee: What was for lunch?

22/01/2021, 17:15 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
22/01/2021, 17:15 - Bee: Packet soup or soup from scratch?
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: I never feel like initiating
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Okay
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Banana was dessert 🤣
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Cool
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Ahhh. That's Norah's kinda dessert
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Well you get tubs of soup in the store
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Norah had a lot of questions about papa feeding ravens
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: It's a good dessert
22/01/2021, 17:16 - Bee: <Media omitted>
22/01/2021, 17:17 - Bee: So I sent her this
22/01/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Spoke to her today?
22/01/2021, 17:17 - Bee: Oh wow. Just have to reheat?
22/01/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
22/01/2021, 17:17 - Bee: I did. Drove around some for Jason's medical insurance work. Spoke to her while I was waiting in the car
22/01/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: What is he feeding the raven?
22/01/2021, 17:19 - Bee: Beef fat. He gets royal treatment
22/01/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Even I'm not fed beef fat
22/01/2021, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: You want beef fat?
22/01/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Nope. But nobody bothered to ask me
22/01/2021, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: I asked you
22/01/2021, 17:21 - Bee: Awwwwwwwww
22/01/2021, 17:21 - Bee: Bas Tu hi ek hai
22/01/2021, 17:21 - Bee: Watch Croods!!!!!!
22/01/2021, 17:21 - Bee: The second one. There's a first one also which I haven't watched so I don't know how it is
22/01/2021, 17:21 - Bee: But the second one is hilarious
22/01/2021, 17:22 - Bee: I laughed out loud so many times. Literally. It was the most I've laughed watching a movie. Maybe it's just my kinda humor
22/01/2021, 17:22 - Bee: Can I call to say goodnight?
22/01/2021, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Oh interesting. I'll watch it soon
22/01/2021, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Yes

23/01/2021, 09:16 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh I saw this video the other day! It's so cool 😁
23/01/2021, 09:19 - Nischal Abraham: Unless you shared it to show off the brides wedding dress 🧐
23/01/2021, 09:36 - Bee: DUUUUUDDDEEEEEEEEE
23/01/2021, 09:36 - Bee: It's looks bomb
23/01/2021, 09:36 - Bee: How did it taste?
23/01/2021, 09:36 - Bee: Did you enjoy cooking it? Eating it?
23/01/2021, 09:36 - Bee: Off day today?
23/01/2021, 09:36 - Bee: Nope. It was for the song
23/01/2021, 09:37 - Bee: The potatoes look delish as well
23/01/2021, 09:37 - Bee: Good job, Nischal! 😊
23/01/2021, 10:22 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. Once the steak went cold it was terrible eating. I need to find another video to prepare it
23/01/2021, 10:23 - Nischal Abraham: It wasn't as hard to make as I thought it would be! Although cleanup took a while then
23/01/2021, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I'm hoping to do some reading
23/01/2021, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool
23/01/2021, 10:24 - Nischal Abraham: It was!! Really happy with how it turned out
23/01/2021, 11:40 - Bee: Oooh. Does it get rubbery if you reheat it?
23/01/2021, 11:41 - Bee: What are you reading?
23/01/2021, 11:42 - Bee: Better than steak?
23/01/2021, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: It gets rubbery as soon as it's cold. Reheating didn't do much so I had to throw away some of it :(
23/01/2021, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Shadow of the Almighty. I'm yet to finish it
23/01/2021, 12:23 - Nischal Abraham: Better than the steak I made 🤣
23/01/2021, 13:08 - Bee: Oh noooo. There must be some hacks no
23/01/2021, 13:08 - Bee: To use leftover steak
23/01/2021, 13:08 - Bee: Hahahah😂 it does look really good
23/01/2021, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: Probably is a way to salvage it. But I got through most of it so it's alright
23/01/2021, 14:02 - Bee: Ahhhh
23/01/2021, 14:02 - Bee: House cleaning is going on here
23/01/2021, 14:48 - Nischal Abraham: How's the cleaning going?
23/01/2021, 16:21 - Bee: I hope it's done by now. Maa and I went to the stores to buy a few things
23/01/2021, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Ah cool cool. Will you be free for a call today?
23/01/2021, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: And can it be after an hour?
23/01/2021, 16:41 - Bee: I'll be free nana
23/01/2021, 16:41 - Bee: Might need more than an hour
23/01/2021, 16:41 - Bee: Let's say 11? And if I'm late I'll let you know? Most likely I will be late
23/01/2021, 16:50 - Nischal Abraham: Alright. I should be free anytime after 11
23/01/2021, 17:32 - Bee: Running late, Nischal
23/01/2021, 17:32 - Bee: In 30?
23/01/2021, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: 👍
23/01/2021, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: If you're okay with it. Hope it's not too late for you
23/01/2021, 17:42 - Bee: No I'll be fine. I napped in the afternoon
23/01/2021, 18:33 - Bee: Hi
23/01/2021, 18:34 - Bee: I'll be free in 5

24/01/2021, 09:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'll do that. But knowing me I'll forget about it so remind me when it's shared please?
24/01/2021, 09:57 - Nischal Abraham: You make it sound so dramatic nana. Enjoy your nap either way. I'm excited for your new chapter

24/01/2021, 12:45 - Bee: Looks pretty. Not enough to build a snowman?
24/01/2021, 12:45 - Bee: Just came back from Sunday school and gospel meeting. I may go out to buy stuff for tomorrow
24/01/2021, 12:45 - Bee: I need hair pins
24/01/2021, 12:45 - Bee: At Noel's?
24/01/2021, 12:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yep I am. I'll let you know if I'm free for the evening
24/01/2021, 12:46 - Bee: Alright
24/01/2021, 12:46 - Bee: Enjoy lunch! Eat extra. Loooottsss of extra
24/01/2021, 16:19 - Bee: Hey! Will a call be possible?
24/01/2021, 17:08 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry Bee! Call won't be possible
24/01/2021, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you weren't up too long. There's a family service meeting at 6pm and I need to lend my laptop for a week to Alex. I'll explain later tonight
24/01/2021, 17:29 - Bee: Alright :). I was up prepping for tomorrow. Will go to bed now
24/01/2021, 17:29 - Bee: Goodnight, for when you go to sleep :))
24/01/2021, 17:29 - Bee: Hope you're day is going splendidly
24/01/2021, 17:34 - Nischal Abraham: Day's not too bad. It was a nice morning with Noel and Liza
24/01/2021, 20:46 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee! Hadn't found the opportunity to message you all day. It's been a while since I've had a full day of activity
24/01/2021, 20:47 - Nischal Abraham: Last night ended up being late. We had the Bible reading and were playing codenames online after till 12am
24/01/2021, 20:48 - Nischal Abraham: This morning I had to force myself awake at 8:20 after snoozing since 7. Took a shower, had a quiet morning with a Psalm. Didn't have a lot of time though since Noel was gonna pick me up at 10:20
24/01/2021, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: I took my guitar along! Played along for songs. Stephen's message was lovely this morning. The David and Bathsheba story but focusing on Psalm 51
24/01/2021, 20:50 - Nischal Abraham: Timon joined for lunch. We had lasagna and sweet potato fries and a lovely salad.
24/01/2021, 20:54 - Nischal Abraham: Went for a nice long walk with Heather and Timon after that. While returning we sprinted up a hill... I don't think I've run in a good while 😂. The cycling was the last intense activity I've done
24/01/2021, 21:01 - Nischal Abraham: Well Alex needed to send his laptop for repairs and his college starts this week, so Timon asked if I could lend him mine for this CAD software he needs
24/01/2021, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: So we were there for a while. Then I came back to No 5 since the family service was happening at 6:30pm. Gareth came in as well
24/01/2021, 21:02 - Nischal Abraham: And then I had dinner, changed my sheets and am now writing all this to you
24/01/2021, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: It's gonna be a big change not to have my laptop with me for a week... But I can't waste time on the laptop if I don't have it. Hoping to spend all this time reading and build new habits
24/01/2021, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: The biggest negative I thought of is not being able to record our calls. But I think we'll survive 😊
24/01/2021, 21:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry for the excessive number of messages. Let me know if you want to me reduce the amount for next time
24/01/2021, 21:06 - Nischal Abraham: More importantly though, I'm praying for you as you start working/training tomorrow. Trust that God will use your worries to show you it's not in your strength but His that you'll excel
24/01/2021, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: You are loved more than I thought was possible, and I can't even imagine how much more by our Lord. Praying for you always. Rest well Bee :)
25/01/2021, 06:05 - Bee: Hey. :)
25/01/2021, 06:06 - Bee: Will reply properly once I'm back home
25/01/2021, 06:06 - Bee: Thank you for praying nana. ♥️
25/01/2021, 06:06 - Bee: I'm praying for you and your day too
25/01/2021, 09:15 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you 😊. Hope your day's been amazing so far
25/01/2021, 17:45 - Bee: Hi nana
25/01/2021, 17:46 - Bee: It was a busy today today. Got home by 5:30. Samuel (Abraham uncle's son. Dolkambh Abraham uncle) and his wife Roshni came over for dinner
25/01/2021, 17:47 - Bee: I made beef curry once I got home. Ashley helped me quite a bit. And then they were here and we had lovely fellowship with them. Then dropped them off home and getting ready for bed now
25/01/2021, 17:49 - Bee: I had an easy day at work. I wasn't assigned any patients. It was just orientation and some more paperwork
25/01/2021, 17:50 - Bee: I'm so exhausted man. Sleep is going to be so sweet
25/01/2021, 17:51 - Bee: I have a morning shift tomorrow. Which is from 7am to 3:30pm
25/01/2021, 17:51 - Bee: How are you? How's your day going?
25/01/2021, 17:51 - Bee: Is codenames a game?
25/01/2021, 17:52 - Bee: That's my second favourite Psalm!
25/01/2021, 17:52 - Bee: Dude wow. Was there dessert?
25/01/2021, 17:52 - Bee: It's Noel's house uphill?
25/01/2021, 17:53 - Bee: I can use zoom in my laptop and record 😊
25/01/2021, 17:54 - Bee: Never!!! ☺️
I won't either. Unless I should? Well let me know
25/01/2021, 17:56 - Nischal Abraham: Your day was eventful!
25/01/2021, 17:57 - Bee: I was unbelievably calm last night and today morning you know. God's peace that passes all understanding
25/01/2021, 17:57 - Bee: Or maybe it's the honeymoon phase and real days are yet to come 😂
25/01/2021, 17:58 - Bee: Oh it was
25/01/2021, 17:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure there'll be something to find joy in even in the busyness
25/01/2021, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'm well. Day's been the usual today. Got off work a few minutes ago and figuring out what I should do and when I should start doing something for dinner
25/01/2021, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
25/01/2021, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Always 😁. Apple berry crumble and ice-cream/custard
25/01/2021, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Not really, but the whole area is hilly around
25/01/2021, 18:00 - Bee: You're living the life I want 😂
25/01/2021, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: That works
25/01/2021, 18:01 - Bee: What's your day like tomorrow?
25/01/2021, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: I like your messages. The more you send the more to like 😊
25/01/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Will you be available for a call? May have to be a short one though
25/01/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Noted
25/01/2021, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Same as today I suppose. There's the pilgrims progress study meeting later tonight
25/01/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Tomorrow
25/01/2021, 18:02 - Bee: Has your hardcopy arrived yet?
25/01/2021, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: I should be. Don't have anything planned so far
25/01/2021, 18:02 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
25/01/2021, 18:02 - Bee: Okay
25/01/2021, 18:02 - Bee: I'll gonna sleep now
25/01/2021, 18:02 - Bee: I'm
25/01/2021, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I'm glad to hear your day was good 😊
25/01/2021, 18:03 - Bee: 😊
25/01/2021, 18:03 - Nischal Abraham: Praying for your tomorrow. Miss you loads. Goodnight!
25/01/2021, 18:04 - Bee: I miss you too nana. More than you think or know

26/01/2021, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! Hope you're day is going splendidly
26/01/2021, 09:39 - Nischal Abraham: Still no plans for my evening so I'll be available for a call. If anything comes up I'll let you know
26/01/2021, 13:47 - Bee: Hi nana
26/01/2021, 13:48 - Bee: Today was my first full day of work
26/01/2021, 13:48 - Bee: Alright. I'll be free too
26/01/2021, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Debby!!! You're a working professional now!! 😁. How does it feel!?
26/01/2021, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: Can't wait to talk to you in the evening. Are you back home now? Tired? Hungry? Excited? Still scared?
26/01/2021, 15:37 - Bee: Exhausting
26/01/2021, 15:37 - Bee: I am back home and tired and hungry and neither excited nor scared anymore. At least for now
26/01/2021, 15:38 - Bee: Sat down for dinner. There's yesterday's beef and I must say that it's the best I've made so far Nischal. And it's easy!!!! You'll be able to cook this dish easily
26/01/2021, 15:38 - Bee: Looking forward to our call so much. 😊
26/01/2021, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: We'll see how easy it is when I have to make it 😂
26/01/2021, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Is 10:45 alright?
26/01/2021, 16:31 - Bee: Yep 😊
26/01/2021, 16:31 - Bee: You said 'when'. Nice
26/01/2021, 17:10 - Bee: I'm free whenever you are
26/01/2021, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/75298871125?pwd=RjF3NTJIZTNmRUJJTGFJU2Z4aHlCdz09
27/01/2021, 12:15 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! I know you probably left your phone at home when you went for work
27/01/2021, 12:16 - Nischal Abraham: Just checking in. It's another busy day in the office for me. Last week of the month has so much to do
27/01/2021, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: Probably not as busy as you are though. Praying for day 3 😊
27/01/2021, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not expecting a reply to any of these messages till tomorrow. Did you get your college thing sorted?
27/01/2021, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: How was your first evening shift?
27/01/2021, 12:17 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have a morning shift tomorrow?
27/01/2021, 12:18 - Nischal Abraham: Did you crash as soon as you came home?
27/01/2021, 12:20 - Nischal Abraham: I got on a call with Daniel Kell last night out of the blue. Got more matters to pray for
27/01/2021, 12:22 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you loads!! Hope you find things to enjoy at work. Looking forward to whenever we get to talk
27/01/2021, 16:31 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
27/01/2021, 16:32 - Bee: I was on my feet for 7.5 hours!!!!! 😫 But I'm not as tired as I was yesterday. I hope I get used to this quickly
27/01/2021, 16:32 - Bee: Dude why not
27/01/2021, 16:33 - Bee: College thing didn't happen. Last night I had asked any principal if she would be available today because I need her signature on a a few papers. Last night she said she'd be available but today morning she said she won't be. So I got to sleep in
27/01/2021, 16:33 - Bee: Don't know when I'll get to go tomorrow
27/01/2021, 16:33 - Bee: Don't know when I'll get to go next**
27/01/2021, 16:34 - Bee: Uneventful. I was assigned a patient today. Wasn't a hectic day bu to was on my feet too much
27/01/2021, 16:35 - Bee: Yes, morning shift tomorrow. For the next one week I'll be on rotation around a few wards and departments so that I get to learn everything. So tomorrow I'll be in the casualty and dialysis ward
27/01/2021, 16:37 - Bee: Not yet. I'm yet to take a shower and eat dinner. I had a snack at the hospital. Misal pav. Not as spicy and delicious as roadside ones but anything is tasty when you're hungry
27/01/2021, 16:37 - Bee: Oh! I hope everything is alright with Diane
27/01/2021, 16:38 - Bee: I miss you too man. I'm sorry I haven't been able to message much. I'm still learning how to spend my time with 10ish hours being spent at work and all
27/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: How's your day going? What's something that stood out/you're thankful for? (From today obv)
27/01/2021, 16:44 - Bee: How are you? Eating well?
27/01/2021, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been busy. A lot of schools can't open next month so getting things sorted for that
27/01/2021, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Annie bought me a cupcake for tea. Very thankful for a lovely treat 😁
27/01/2021, 16:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm good... Trying to figure out where my day ends up disappearing. I waste so much time that I know I shouldn't
27/01/2021, 16:53 - Nischal Abraham: And yep eating very well. Maybe too well... I have a hunch I'm overeating and that's where all my lethargy is coming from. I'm not eating proportionate to the amount of work I'm doing in a day
27/01/2021, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: So the solution would be to exercise
27/01/2021, 16:54 - Nischal Abraham: But then this happens
27/01/2021, 16:55 - Nischal Abraham: 10ish hours of work might just be a blessing. Though I can't imagine standing for 7.5 hours 😶
27/01/2021, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Yep Diane is fine. Just their plans for the future. They're done with their course in June and returning to Ireland. Diane is looking for work but they don't know where they'll be. So no place and no work yet with a baby on the way in June
27/01/2021, 17:56 - Bee: 🤤
27/01/2021, 17:58 - Bee: Oh. Won't she have to take time off a little before and a more after birth anyway?
27/01/2021, 17:58 - Bee: A lot after*
27/01/2021, 17:59 - Bee: Maybe exercise can be in the morning then?
27/01/2021, 17:59 - Bee: I'm off to bed
27/01/2021, 17:59 - Bee: Goodnight for when you go to sleep nana
27/01/2021, 17:59 - Bee: Will you be free for a short call tomorrow night?
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Bee: My night. Your evening
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: I should most probably be
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Bee: Alright then
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep she will. If she gets the job she can take maternity leave
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Bee: Baby's due in July no?
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep yep
27/01/2021, 18:00 - Bee: Cool cool
27/01/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Shall be praying
27/01/2021, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Okay :). Goodnight Bee!

28/01/2021, 08:44 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee. Pray your day's going well too 😊. Day 4!!!!
28/01/2021, 11:15 - Bee: Day 4 was alright :)
28/01/2021, 11:15 - Bee: I'm going to take a nap now
28/01/2021, 11:29 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your nap. Another busy day in the office for me but it's just me
28/01/2021, 15:49 - Bee: Woke up, sat for the Bible study, and then was on a long call with Abisha
28/01/2021, 15:49 - Bee: I have an evening shift tomorrow. Will be going to college in the morning

28/01/2021, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: Yea sure no problem
28/01/2021, 17:43 - Bee: Hi

29/01/2021, 16:01 - Bee: HIIII!!!!! Just got back home
29/01/2021, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Heyy!
29/01/2021, 16:01 - Bee: I shall
29/01/2021, 16:01 - Bee: Tomorrow evening
29/01/2021, 16:01 - Bee: How are you doing nana?
29/01/2021, 16:01 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't expect to see you online so early 😮
29/01/2021, 16:01 - Bee: I know!!! Papa came to pick me up
29/01/2021, 16:02 - Bee: But I dropped both of us back home. On the bike 🤩
29/01/2021, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: I'm well. Finished with home student sendouts in the morning so I decided to take the evening off from PBS work
29/01/2021, 16:02 - Bee: Ahh. What are your plans?
29/01/2021, 16:02 - Bee: Tired?
29/01/2021, 16:02 - Bee: How's the new phone?
29/01/2021, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Got my laptop back from Phil. Was doing some job hunting related stuff till now
29/01/2021, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: In a sense. I didn't do much today but didn't sleep on time last night but I should be fine if I sleep tonight
29/01/2021, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Its lovely!! Feels so delicate... I really should get a cover for it soon... Even if its just so that the back camera isn't touching the desk every time I set it down
29/01/2021, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Are you tired? I'm sure you'll be crashing soon after dinner and a shower
29/01/2021, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: And since its a morning shift tomorrow... Praying you have a lovely time 😊. How was your day today?
29/01/2021, 16:07 - Nischal Abraham: Nice Bee! You're the designated driver and rider now 😂
29/01/2021, 17:31 - Bee: Excitement of having a new phone? YouTube? More work?
29/01/2021, 17:31 - Bee: You can use the ring that you received 😂
29/01/2021, 17:32 - Bee: I'm exhausted. That's exactly what I did. Complained about inadequate staffing, ate dinner, took a shower, and I'm all comfy in bed now
29/01/2021, 17:33 - Bee: It was busy to say the least. I was on the 4th floor today. Had much to do. Will complain when we talk next
29/01/2021, 17:33 - Bee: That reminds me... Will you be free for a call tomorrow night? I have a morning shift and a day off on Sunday
29/01/2021, 17:34 - Bee: Yes 😂 eyeing Papa's cycle now 😂
29/01/2021, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free tomorrow for a call. I'll let you know if anything comes up to the contrary
29/01/2021, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: That'll be worse than having the camera touch the table. I don't like the ring on the phone
29/01/2021, 17:38 - Bee: Alright
29/01/2021, 17:38 - Bee: Thought as much
29/01/2021, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: What was for dinner?
29/01/2021, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Though if you're going to sleep let's skip the talk for tomorrow. Hope you have a lovely day tomorrow Bee 😊
29/01/2021, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: I got to talk to parents for an hour just now
29/01/2021, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Will be playing with the lads later tonight so looking forward to that!
29/01/2021, 17:40 - Bee: I had Chhole and rice
29/01/2021, 17:40 - Bee: You too, Nischal 😊
29/01/2021, 17:40 - Bee: Yay!
29/01/2021, 17:40 - Bee: Goodnight 😊
29/01/2021, 17:40 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh! Weird that I wanted to make something with my chole that'll go with rice 😂
29/01/2021, 17:40 - Bee: I miss you.
29/01/2021, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you too
29/01/2021, 17:41 - Bee: Chole is easy!! Look up a recipe and I'm sure you'll cook it well
29/01/2021, 17:41 - Bee: But you need Chhole masala
29/01/2021, 17:41 - Bee: It's okay you add what you've got
29/01/2021, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: Will do for tomorrow. Tonight is chilli con cairne which I skipped yesterday because I was busy noodling with my phone
29/01/2021, 17:41 - Bee: Ahhhhhhh
29/01/2021, 17:42 - Bee: Cool cool
29/01/2021, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: I'll use garam masala instead 😂
29/01/2021, 17:42 - Bee: Yep! Works with anything
29/01/2021, 17:42 - Nischal Abraham: Okay now sleep! You have an early morning

01/02/2021, 09:09 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free for a call if nothing comes up. Let me know if you're up for it. It's fine if you just want to head to bed 😊
01/02/2021, 11:08 - Bee: Hi bb
01/02/2021, 11:08 - Bee: <Media omitted>

01/02/2021, 13:11 - Nischal Abraham: Look at my bae all cute in white ☺️
01/02/2021, 13:12 - Nischal Abraham: And that's a cool mask! I wonder why all masks aren't just made that way
01/02/2021, 13:13 - Nischal Abraham: Sure! I should be done by 5 as usual
01/02/2021, 14:08 - Bee: Nope doesn't hurt at all. I hope I don't get fever tomorrow that's all
01/02/2021, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you don't. Are you done with work for the day?
01/02/2021, 14:26 - Bee: I am. I had a morning shift. Came back and thought I'll sleep for a bit but couldn't fall asleep. I think I'm not as tired as I was last week. Which is goooood. Because the day was just as busy
01/02/2021, 14:26 - Bee: What man you're making me blush
01/02/2021, 14:27 - Bee: That's an N95 mask... I think you'll find it in any pharmacy. But you can use one mask only for 5-6 days
01/02/2021, 15:15 - Bee: ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
01/02/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good 😊

01/02/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: What's this for?
01/02/2021, 16:06 - Bee: Yep. We get 5 for a month
01/02/2021, 16:06 - Bee: No reason
01/02/2021, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: What man you're making me blush
01/02/2021, 16:58 - Bee: ☺️
01/02/2021, 16:59 - Nischal Abraham: Do you think you'll be free for a call then?
01/02/2021, 16:59 - Bee: Are you done with work?
01/02/2021, 17:00 - Bee: I want to go to sleep in 15. So a short voice call if you're free?
01/02/2021, 17:00 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
01/02/2021, 17:01 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. We can skip if you're tired but I'm free
01/02/2021, 17:02 - Bee: I'll call?

02/02/2021, 16:11 - Nischal Abraham: It has been productive and busy. How was your day? Feel like taking a nap today?
02/02/2021, 16:53 - Bee: It was my busiest day ever. Came home and hour late. And I've got bodyache. Don't know if it's from the busyness or the vaccine. Please pray for me nana
02/02/2021, 16:54 - Bee: Napped for two hours. Still so tired. Going to sleep now
02/02/2021, 16:56 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying. Hope it is just the busyness and you feel better tomorrow
02/02/2021, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Rest well Bee! ICU sounds intense
02/02/2021, 17:00 - Bee: It is 🥲
02/02/2021, 17:00 - Bee: Goodnight Nischal ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
02/02/2021, 17:01 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/02/2021, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: I love your cheese
02/02/2021, 17:05 - Bee: 😊
02/02/2021, 17:06 - Nischal Abraham: And I love you. But mostly your cheese 😂
02/02/2021, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Anyway hope you're day is less tiring tomorrow! Praying you find something you'll enjoy
02/02/2021, 17:08 - Bee: Dude.
02/02/2021, 17:08 - Bee: Read the last one again
02/02/2021, 17:09 - Bee: Also, my cheese is extraordinary. And limited edition. That's why
02/02/2021, 17:09 - Nischal Abraham: Of course. Amul can't even compete
02/02/2021, 17:09 - Bee: Same. I enjoyed my day. But it was busy that's all. I want to be stronger and build endurance
02/02/2021, 17:10 - Bee: Forget Amul. None of the fancy ones that you get in Ireland hold a candle
02/02/2021, 17:19 - Bee: Just found out that I have an evening shift tomorrow. I can sleep in!!
02/02/2021, 17:19 - Bee: Byyyeee
02/02/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Cool!!! Enjoy your sleep in!
02/02/2021, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: Definitely. My Bee makes cheese instead of honey
02/02/2021, 17:42 - Bee: 😂.
Only because I've already got my honey.
03/02/2021, 07:06 - Bee: Good morning, bb!
03/02/2021, 07:07 - Bee: Off to work. Have a great day, you ☺️
03/02/2021, 08:57 - Nischal Abraham: Hope your day goes well. Praying for you!
03/02/2021, 16:31 - Bee: Hey :)
03/02/2021, 16:31 - Bee: Today wasn't as busy as yesterday
03/02/2021, 16:31 - Bee: I know it's last minute. But will you be free for a call?
03/02/2021, 16:31 - Bee: In an hourish?
03/02/2021, 16:32 - Bee: I have an evening shift tomorrow as well

03/02/2021, 17:02 - Bee: Okay. Still eating dinner
03/02/2021, 17:02 - Bee: I need to shower as well
03/02/2021, 17:02 - Bee: I am not nana
03/02/2021, 17:05 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. I'll be here 😊

04/02/2021, 16:24 - Bee: Because I couldn't remember and had to click on forget password
04/02/2021, 16:25 - Bee: It was a light day. I'm not very tired. Which is good because I've got a morning shift tomorrow

04/02/2021, 18:02 - Bee: Yes yes

05/02/2021, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: I had dreams that included you in it and I don't remember a whole lot about them now :(
05/02/2021, 10:38 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope you have a lovely day! Today just feels like one of those days where I'm missing you a whole lot more than usual

05/02/2021, 11:52 - Bee: I'm done for today and have my day off tomorrow. Will you be free for a call tonight? Today is Friday and probably have game night planned. But if you don't and you're free, let me know
05/02/2021, 11:53 - Bee: Philomena aunty wants to taste the beef I make. So I'll get to that in a bit. Nothing else planned
05/02/2021, 11:53 - Bee: It is Anjali's birthday on the 10th and I really want to get her something. I don't have any ideas tho
05/02/2021, 11:54 - Bee: Aww :(
05/02/2021, 11:54 - Bee: Full work day today?
05/02/2021, 11:55 - Bee: Maybe it was a nightmare and it's good that you don't remember?
05/02/2021, 12:00 - Nischal Abraham: I would love to be on a call today. It may be game night but that's only after your bedtime so it doesn't really matter

05/02/2021, 12:01 - Bee: And high-five, of course.
05/02/2021, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hmm... Now I'm the worst at coming up with gift ideas but if you want a wall to bounce ideas off then lets talk about it during our call 😂
05/02/2021, 12:01 - Bee: Cool cool
05/02/2021, 12:01 - Bee: I'll remember to bring it up
05/02/2021, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be taking a nap now? Are you tired?

06/02/2021, 09:41 - Bee: A little too spicy. But it's yum
06/02/2021, 09:41 - Bee: ☺️
06/02/2021, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice! Makes me hungry just thinking about it
06/02/2021, 10:17 - Nischal Abraham: Might also be because I haven't had breakfast yet 😂
06/02/2021, 11:48 - Bee: So late!

06/02/2021, 15:29 - Nischal Abraham: Would it be possible to talk for a bit today? It can be a short call whenever you're up for it
06/02/2021, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: Doesn't have to be at night
06/02/2021, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: But I guess it's already night 😶
06/02/2021, 15:30 - Nischal Abraham: I mean like later at night. Well that's only if you're free. It's fine if you cant
06/02/2021, 15:41 - Bee: No Sunday school tomorrow. There's going to be a wedding in the hall where we gather
06/02/2021, 15:41 - Bee: Yeah... B.Ed right

07/02/2021, 07:42 - Nischal Abraham: I pray you do too! I'll be heading to Gareth and Maggie's for worship and lunch at 11:30. Looking forward to it ☺️
07/02/2021, 11:52 - Bee: Don't feel like taking a nap. Today was a busy but good day!
07/02/2021, 11:52 - Bee: Woohooooo. You get to see the girls!!!!
07/02/2021, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: I do! Back to awkward phases maybe
07/02/2021, 16:04 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I'm back in the office. How's your day going?
07/02/2021, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Morning shift tomorrow,m
07/02/2021, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: ?*
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: Busy. Priya, her father, and her sister came over  to discuss wedding details. October 23rd is the day
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: They left 15 minutes ago. Yet to have dinner
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: I'm so sleepy. Didn't sleep once I got back because they were going to come over
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Oh wow. That does sound busy. Is that why no afternoon nap?
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: Yep. For the next 3 days
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: Yep
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: How's your day going?
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool
07/02/2021, 16:19 - Bee: How was your family call?
07/02/2021, 16:20 - Bee: Ammachi must've been happy
07/02/2021, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: Day's been well so far. I feel sleepy too and it's too late in the day for an afternoon nap
07/02/2021, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: It was good!
07/02/2021, 16:20 - Nischal Abraham: She was 😊. Nidhi didn't speak a word the whole call 😂
07/02/2021, 16:20 - Bee: Why?!?! Because Malayalam? Was it extended family?
07/02/2021, 16:21 - Bee: Early night then?
07/02/2021, 16:24 - Nischal Abraham: Malayalam. Just the family and ammachi
07/02/2021, 16:25 - Nischal Abraham: Hopefully. We'll see how it goes. I came back to the office for the call with family but lunch was so nice I think that's why I'm sleepy
07/02/2021, 16:38 - Bee: What was for lunch? And dessert?
07/02/2021, 16:38 - Bee: I'm skipping dinner tonight. I'm too full. There were some snacks during the discussion time
07/02/2021, 16:38 - Bee: I just want to go to sleep. But I know it won't be possible unless most people at home go to sleep
07/02/2021, 16:40 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe you're tired enough to fall asleep with people awake?
07/02/2021, 16:41 - Nischal Abraham: Lasagna, potato wedges, onion rings and chips.
Homemade Swiss roll, chocolate and peanut butter muffin cake thingies
07/02/2021, 16:42 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a productive discussion 😋
07/02/2021, 16:48 - Bee: What a feast man 🤤
07/02/2021, 16:48 - Bee: I kept hogging

13/02/2021, 03:42 - Bee: Your internet is on!!!! Don't want to wake you up. Last message. 
Will you be free for a call around your lunch time? You have STEP and might be busy. Or maybe you're attending with one of the guys.
Let me know if you are. 
Because I think I might sleep through my lunch alarm today as well.
Nischal, I'm blessed to know and have you. I don't tell you that enough. 
I'm gonna eat and sleep now. 
I finally pooped upto my heart's content today. Night shift timings threw my poop schedule out the window. Today feels good tho.
Okay no more poop talk.
Good morning, bb!

13/02/2021, 08:33 - Nischal Abraham: Up*
13/02/2021, 12:26 - Bee: Hi!!!!
13/02/2021, 12:26 - Bee: I slept for 8 hours straight
13/02/2021, 12:26 - Bee: What a long break
13/02/2021, 12:36 - Nischal Abraham: So linner time now?
13/02/2021, 12:40 - Bee: Yes
13/02/2021, 12:41 - Bee: But I must eat some more before I leave otherwise I'll be starving
13/02/2021, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: Yep makes sense. I should be free for a call in half an hour. No plans to go anywhere
13/02/2021, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know what works for you
13/02/2021, 12:44 - Bee: 7:15? In an hour
13/02/2021, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Sure! Sounds good 😊

13/02/2021, 15:09 - Bee: Instagram!!!!
13/02/2021, 15:09 - Nischal Abraham: I sent that before I called you 😅
13/02/2021, 15:10 - Bee: 😂😂😂😂😂he added music!!! And took the time to set up his camera!!! Fun video
13/02/2021, 15:10 - Bee: Yep
13/02/2021, 15:10 - Bee: Looks so pretty and so freezing
13/02/2021, 15:10 - Bee: I shall leave now
13/02/2021, 15:10 - Nischal Abraham: He did! I think you can do it too. It's a Samsung feature
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Bee: Ahhhh. But there's no snow here
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Bee: Or a kayak
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. Have a fun night!!
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Nischal Abraham: Such a shame. Looks like you'll have to move
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Bee: If fun refers to quiet and easy then yes I hope I have one of those
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Bee: 😂
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Bee: If the Lord wills then there's no fighting it
13/02/2021, 15:11 - Bee: Bye!
13/02/2021, 15:12 - Bee: ♥️
13/02/2021, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: Bye! ❤️
13/02/2021, 21:58 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee. We may not be able to talk tomorrow after all. I'll be heading over to Gareth's in the morning and will probably only be back later in the night for STEP
13/02/2021, 21:58 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you enjoy your day! Say hi to my family for me 😊
13/02/2021, 22:17 - Nischal Abraham: That's well said Bee. Also the sessions on Romans has been immense! So much more to these verses than the last time I did the full read through of it!!
13/02/2021, 22:19 - Nischal Abraham: One of these days our conversation needs to be on sermons that really impacted us well. On that note I'm guilty of not having heard the 2 messages you've suggested from Bethesda but I hope to correct this error soon 😅
14/02/2021, 09:06 - Bee: Hi!!!!!!!!!!
14/02/2021, 09:08 - Bee: If a stranger looks at me they'll think I'm pregnant. I ate so much. The food was so good!!!! Thought of you every moment
14/02/2021, 09:09 - Bee: Eventful day. Enjoy! There's always tomorrow for a call
14/02/2021, 09:11 - Bee: Oh yeah. Those two were really good. I'm sure I've got much more to glean if I listen to them again
14/02/2021, 09:12 - Bee: There's no Sunday school today. I'll be asleep until it's time to go to Sangeeta didi's
14/02/2021, 09:24 - Bee: Happy valentine's Day, my forever valentine. You might probably roll your eyes reading this message but it's alright. I want to celebrate everything and every day with you.
 I'm very grapeful for you 🍇 
Goodnight!
14/02/2021, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
14/02/2021, 10:30 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Sounds like you had a wonderful lunch 😁
14/02/2021, 10:31 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. I was free for half an hour now but I wasn't sure if I would be... There's always tomorrow for a call
14/02/2021, 10:31 - Nischal Abraham: Loads of sleep to enjoy! 😊. Did you sleep in the morning before worship?
14/02/2021, 10:31 - Nischal Abraham: /during worship
14/02/2021, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: I won't roll my eyes. I will cherish every action of love you share with me. Even on fabricated marketing days that try to up prices for chocolates and flowers and cards 😂
14/02/2021, 10:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'm thankful for everything we do get to share 😊. For some reason your grapeful pun reminded me of memes made from songs of Solomon
14/02/2021, 16:56 - Bee: That's alright. I was fast asleep anyway
14/02/2021, 16:57 - Bee: Nope. Slept after lunch. Woke up at 8 and was late for Pani Puri :(
14/02/2021, 16:57 - Bee: 😂 when you put it like that...
At least I didn't get you chocolates or flowers or cards
14/02/2021, 16:58 - Bee: What memes? You're holding back Songs of Solomon memes?! What men
14/02/2021, 17:29 - Nischal Abraham: You sleeping?
14/02/2021, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no!
14/02/2021, 17:37 - Nischal Abraham: I will still cherish every action of love you share with me
14/02/2021, 18:07 - Bee: Nope. Will be up for a bit. Are you back home?
14/02/2021, 18:07 - Nischal Abraham: Yep! Quick call?
14/02/2021, 18:08 - Bee: I did go. But I should've gone on time. I didn't even inform that I'd be late. Because I didn't expect myself to sleep through two alarms
14/02/2021, 18:08 - Bee: Yes!!!!! Give me one min
14/02/2021, 18:08 - Nischal Abraham: 👍
14/02/2021, 18:13 - Bee: Hi

15/02/2021, 08:06 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee. What's up? Did you sleep well?
15/02/2021, 09:40 - Bee: Slept really well :)
15/02/2021, 09:40 - Bee: Woke up at 10:30 only
15/02/2021, 09:41 - Bee: Philomena aunty wanted to buy some stuff so we were out for a while
15/02/2021, 09:41 - Bee: Going to have more (the curry) for lunch. Leftover parcel from yesterday. IMS o excited!!!!
15/02/2021, 09:41 - Bee: I'm so*
15/02/2021, 10:25 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely! Hope you have a wonderful day Bee ☺️. Will you be speaking to Norah?
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Bee: I hope so. After my nap now
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Bee: There might be Pani Puri for dinner!!
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Bee: Bye
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Bee: How's your day going? Slept okay?
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Bee: Bye
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Bee: Hi!!!!
15/02/2021, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/02/2021, 11:32 - Bee: I'm going to take a nap
15/02/2021, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: Day's not too bad. Just the regular work in the office
15/02/2021, 11:32 - Bee: Happy post-valentine's day Day!
15/02/2021, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: Slept from 11:30 to 7 but I still feel tired 😅
15/02/2021, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: I'll tell you at the end of the day if it was happy or not
15/02/2021, 11:33 - Bee: That's only 7.5 hours of sleep. Don't you usually get more?
15/02/2021, 11:33 - Bee: Okay. I look forward to hearing about it
15/02/2021, 11:33 - Nischal Abraham: 2 days in a row!? 😱
15/02/2021, 11:34 - Nischal Abraham: Sometimes. And other times I get less... Well this time it wasn't my fault so I don't feel bad I got less sleep
15/02/2021, 11:35 - Bee: Yes!!!! Wish you were here man. One day
15/02/2021, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: One day soon
15/02/2021, 16:43 - Bee: Hey! I'll be free by 10:35. Let me know if you'll be free for a call then
15/02/2021, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free around then. More closer to 10:45, though I'll let you know if I'm free earlier
15/02/2021, 16:45 - Bee: Okay
15/02/2021, 16:52 - Bee: It will be 10:45 for me as well.
15/02/2021, 16:57 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
15/02/2021, 17:16 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
15/02/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Ready when you are
15/02/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Hi
15/02/2021, 17:20 - Bee: I'll call?
15/02/2021, 17:37 - Bee: Hi Nischal
15/02/2021, 17:37 - Bee: I'm not moving the phone as much as you
16/02/2021, 01:13 - Bee: Goood morning, Nischal!
16/02/2021, 07:49 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! Hopefully you're finishing up your shift
16/02/2021, 07:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have a beautiful day! Do you have a morning shift tomorrow as well?
16/02/2021, 07:50 - Nischal Abraham: It's been raining all morning here... You'd like it
16/02/2021, 11:12 - Bee: Hey! :)
16/02/2021, 11:12 - Bee: Yes, morning shift tomorrow
16/02/2021, 11:12 - Bee: It wasn't a good day. I had 3 patients and lots to do and I was lagging behind so much. 3 weeks in and I'm still so slow :(
16/02/2021, 11:13 - Bee: I'm sure I would. More so because you'd be there
16/02/2021, 11:13 - Bee: I hope your day is going much better than mine. Not too difficult for that though because mine was baaadd
16/02/2021, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Aww Debby 🙁. You're done for the day now. Rest up and don't worry about what's past
16/02/2021, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: My day is going well. Did you know today is pancake Day? Not that I'm having any pancakes but just thought it was interesting
16/02/2021, 11:32 - Nischal Abraham: I'm celebrating Panini Tuesday instead 😁. Heather's treat since she couldn't join us last week
16/02/2021, 15:34 - Bee: I think Pancake day has something to do with Lent
16/02/2021, 15:35 - Bee: Wow! Good food for you 😊
16/02/2021, 15:35 - Bee: I had a long nap
16/02/2021, 16:13 - Nischal Abraham: How do you feel now?
16/02/2021, 16:33 - Bee: Bleh...
16/02/2021, 16:33 - Bee: I oversleep when I'm stressed. I want to go to sleep
16/02/2021, 16:34 - Nischal Abraham: Early bedtime tonight then?
16/02/2021, 16:34 - Bee: Yep. In half an hour I hope
16/02/2021, 16:34 - Bee: How's your day going?
16/02/2021, 16:35 - Nischal Abraham: It was a normal day today. Warmer and sunnier than previous days
16/02/2021, 16:36 - Bee: No more rain?!
16/02/2021, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: No rain since I sent you that message 😂
16/02/2021, 16:36 - Nischal Abraham: Very bright and sunny
16/02/2021, 16:37 - Bee: Done with work?
16/02/2021, 16:37 - Bee: 😂
16/02/2021, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Sort of yea. Being lazy and slow with what I'm doing
16/02/2021, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Post lunch I've just been feeling lethargic
16/02/2021, 16:38 - Bee: Give me your job
16/02/2021, 16:38 - Bee: Lunch was that good
16/02/2021, 16:39 - Nischal Abraham: It's yours for the taking. I can give you a recommendation. Although the visa will have to be handled by you
16/02/2021, 16:40 - Bee: I'll get married to you and come. Will my visa be sorted then? Wait. You're not on work visa no?
16/02/2021, 16:44 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not 😅. I don't think us being married would make any difference to your visa status in Ireland
16/02/2021, 16:45 - Nischal Abraham: Had any moody incidents today?
16/02/2021, 16:45 - Bee: Aww man. UK nurses get visas for their spouse and kids. I don't know about Ireland
16/02/2021, 16:47 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe Ireland does too. Cause my previous roommates family came because she was working as a nurse
16/02/2021, 16:47 - Bee: Nope. Just a lot of resting/sleeping
16/02/2021, 16:48 - Bee: Oh. Isn't he working as a nurse too?
16/02/2021, 16:48 - Nischal Abraham: He only started looking for work after he came here
16/02/2021, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Glad to hear you're getting time to sleep 😌
16/02/2021, 16:51 - Nischal Abraham: Finally finished the last of my pile
16/02/2021, 16:59 - Bee: Back upstairs?
16/02/2021, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
16/02/2021, 17:02 - Nischal Abraham: Traveled back from work 😂
16/02/2021, 17:03 - Bee: 😂
16/02/2021, 17:03 - Bee: What a time consuming, tiring travel
16/02/2021, 17:04 - Nischal Abraham: Ikr. You and me both
16/02/2021, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I hope you have a lovely day tomorrow
16/02/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: And that your sleep is restful. And that the rest of your day is beautiful as well
16/02/2021, 17:19 - Bee: I hope so too :( I'll be happy if it's an okay day. Lovely bhi Nahi rehga toh chalega
16/02/2021, 17:19 - Bee: Thank you nana
16/02/2021, 17:19 - Bee: What are you doing?
16/02/2021, 17:19 - Bee: What's for dinner?
16/02/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be praying it's an okay day then 😂
16/02/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Yesssss
16/02/2021, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: I have options. Bread, or leftover pasta
16/02/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Pasta with spinach? How did that turn out!
16/02/2021, 17:20 - Bee: ?*
16/02/2021, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: It was alright. I didn't measure any of the things I was putting in. But I did find chicken nuggets
16/02/2021, 17:21 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/02/2021, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: It was sort of dry so I clearly need more sauce
16/02/2021, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe in a year right?
16/02/2021, 17:21 - Bee: Yep. The day before I lose it
16/02/2021, 17:21 - Bee: Goodnight nana ♥️♥️♥️
16/02/2021, 17:22 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! You are cherished and loved for every moment of every day
16/02/2021, 17:22 - Bee: ?!
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: And someday I can do that with you in person
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Bee: Do what?!
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Ashley obviously
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Bee: Cherish and love?
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Bee: Duh. Why didn't I think of that
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Yea nana. Who else?
16/02/2021, 17:23 - Bee: My bb
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: What?
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Bee: Or Bebe, the way you pronounce it 😂
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Bee: What?
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: That's the only thing I hear in my head when I read it
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Bee: 😂
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: How do you pronounce it?
16/02/2021, 17:24 - Bee: Baby no
16/02/2021, 17:25 - Bee: Or just bee-bee
16/02/2021, 17:25 - Bee: In my head
16/02/2021, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: 😂. I was just gonna say that
16/02/2021, 17:25 - Bee: Reminds me of the joke Biju uncle sent
16/02/2021, 17:25 - Nischal Abraham: Am I keeping you up beyond your bedtime?
16/02/2021, 17:26 - Bee: Nope
16/02/2021, 17:26 - Bee: Evening nap isn't letting me fall asleep now
16/02/2021, 17:26 - Bee: Plus everyone's awake and lights are on so
16/02/2021, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: I don't think staring at your phone is helping either way
16/02/2021, 17:26 - Bee: Why so wise
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Bee: I shall keep it aside
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Bee: My phone
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: I despise my wisdom too often
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Okay
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Byee!
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Bee: Talk to you tomorrow?
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Bee: Bye :)
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to 😊. Let me know when
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Bee: Okay. I will
16/02/2021, 17:27 - Bee: 🤗
16/02/2021, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: ❤️
17/02/2021, 08:40 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! How was your shift today?
17/02/2021, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: Praying you have a lovely rest of the day
17/02/2021, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably only be working till lunch so let me know what time works for you to talk
17/02/2021, 12:27 - Bee: Brb
17/02/2021, 12:57 - Bee: Hey :))
17/02/2021, 12:57 - Bee: My day was alright. Better than yesterday
17/02/2021, 12:57 - Bee: There's Pani Puri plans for tonight

21/02/2021, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice. I'm still at Noel's place. Playing a bit of piano... Terribly
21/02/2021, 18:32 - Bee: How are you typing and playing the piano at the same time? Is that why you're playing terribly?
21/02/2021, 19:20 - Nischal Abraham: Haha I wish that were the reason. I'm back in the office now.
22/02/2021, 03:57 - Bee: Helllooo....
I know just like me you too treasure Reenee in your life and would absolutely love it if you could write a short message and send a picture along with it(if you have one)to madabejo@gmail.com by Tuesday....
The plan is to make a tiny magazine (mostly a soft copy) with messages from people who think she's A1 since day one....

It would mean the world to her...I'm sure...

Also do NOT TELL HER OR ANYONE ELSE... ITS A SURPRISE AND WE DO NOT WANT HER TO GET EVEN THE SLIGHTEST HINT...

Thanks a ton,
Berachah (REENEE'S FRIEND)
22/02/2021, 08:01 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! I'll try and write a message in today. What does A1 mean?
22/02/2021, 09:04 - Nischal Abraham: What's your plans for the day?

26/02/2021, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: If you need an emergency call to get out of things I'm here 😁
26/02/2021, 20:04 - Bee: 😂
26/02/2021, 20:04 - Bee: Thanks man
27/02/2021, 14:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! Not expecting a reply. Hope you're having an amazing time!!
27/02/2021, 14:10 - Nischal Abraham: Since I haven't received a call yet I'm taking that as a good sign that you haven't needed an SOS 😂
27/02/2021, 14:51 - Bee: Hey!!! I'm back home
27/02/2021, 14:52 - Bee: If I'd called you as an SOS contact, how would you have helped me?!
27/02/2021, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'd think of a way. Maybe not very effective but I'd still try
27/02/2021, 15:09 - Bee: I'm sure you would 😊
27/02/2021, 15:09 - Bee: There was no need for an SOS call so that's good right?
27/02/2021, 15:12 - Nischal Abraham: You tell me. How was it?
27/02/2021, 15:13 - Bee: Overall it was a good day. There were times that wished I was back home but there were times when I was enjoying as well
27/02/2021, 15:13 - Bee: How's your day going?
27/02/2021, 15:13 - Bee: What are you do?
27/02/2021, 15:13 - Bee: Doin*
27/02/2021, 15:13 - Bee: Doing*
27/02/2021, 15:13 - Nischal Abraham: Making some lyric videos. Day's been an ordinary Saturday so far. Quiet and indoors
27/02/2021, 15:14 - Bee: Oh! What application are you using?
27/02/2021, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Shotcut
27/02/2021, 15:14 - Bee: Oh. Easy to use?
27/02/2021, 15:14 - Nischal Abraham: Easy enough for a lyric video. I'm just adding text over a background video on loop
27/02/2021, 15:15 - Nischal Abraham: Looping the video seems to be the worst part so far. It's hard finding a smooth transition
27/02/2021, 15:15 - Bee: There are no transition options?
27/02/2021, 15:17 - Nischal Abraham: There are. But if the original video doesn't loop very well it's an effort to find something that looks good
27/02/2021, 15:34 - Bee: Oh. How many are you trying to get done?
27/02/2021, 15:34 - Bee: I really want to finish Reenee's video today. I didn't gift her anything for her birthday :(
27/02/2021, 15:42 - Nischal Abraham: What about the frame?
27/02/2021, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: 5 that Gareth said the kids already know well
27/02/2021, 15:44 - Bee: That's going to take another week
27/02/2021, 15:45 - Nischal Abraham: Did Berachah like hers? Or did you wrap it before giving it?
27/02/2021, 16:27 - Bee: I wrapped it. She liked it!
27/02/2021, 16:27 - Bee: I finished the video!!! Uploading it bow
27/02/2021, 16:28 - Bee: Now
27/02/2021, 16:28 - Nischal Abraham: Video for Reenee?
27/02/2021, 16:28 - Bee: Yes!!!!!
27/02/2021, 16:30 - Nischal Abraham: Awesome!
27/02/2021, 16:31 - Nischal Abraham: Did you remember your ideas you had finally?
27/02/2021, 16:31 - Bee: Nope

27/02/2021, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure she'll love it
27/02/2021, 16:37 - Nischal Abraham: Made me lol
27/02/2021, 16:38 - Nischal Abraham: Even though I've already seen the clips of  you and Ashley and you and your dad
27/02/2021, 16:39 - Bee: I hope so!!!
27/02/2021, 16:39 - Bee: What men
27/02/2021, 16:39 - Bee: With music?
27/02/2021, 16:39 - Bee: 😂
27/02/2021, 19:03 - Bee: Had to get off the call. I'm getting to attend worship after a loong time and I want to be wide awake. Also because I can't sleep in or have an afternoon nap

28/02/2021, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: Is it cause I was around you didn't talk much?
28/02/2021, 19:55 - Bee: Nope. Because it was waayyy past her bedtime
28/02/2021, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea that happened. Well you can get 2 things done by calling Ruth then 😁
28/02/2021, 19:56 - Bee: Yep. That's what I'll do tomorrow
28/02/2021, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: You could exercise. Or play the ukulele

28/02/2021, 19:56 - Bee: I don't want to exercise :(

28/02/2021, 19:58 - Bee: 😂

28/02/2021, 19:58 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just suggesting. You can pick and choose whatever you want or don't want to do 😂
28/02/2021, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: You could just sleep all day and laze around, play a game and relax the whole day
28/02/2021, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: Decompress
28/02/2021, 20:00 - Bee: This sounds like the most probable option
28/02/2021, 20:00 - Nischal Abraham: The movie watching could be tomorrow
28/02/2021, 20:01 - Nischal Abraham: What time do you plan on sleeping tonight?

28/02/2021, 20:07 - Bee: What colour sweatshirt would you like
28/02/2021, 20:07 - Bee: Darker shades or lighter?

28/02/2021, 20:07 - Bee: And you're not disturbing
28/02/2021, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Lighter. I tend to have too many dark shade things

28/02/2021, 20:08 - Bee: Okay. Do you have a colour in mind
28/02/2021, 20:08 - Nischal Abraham: Nope
28/02/2021, 20:08 - Bee: Or. I'll send you pics when I find them
28/02/2021, 20:08 - Bee: Whenever I go to a place that sells sweatshirts
28/02/2021, 20:09 - Bee: Asking only because the color of the prints will have to match no.
28/02/2021, 20:09 - Nischal Abraham: Don't give me choices 🙁. Just select something that appeals to yoi

01/03/2021, 11:15 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh Chinese! 😋. Indian Chinese is way better than Irish chinese
01/03/2021, 11:17 - Bee: I don't doubt it. Especially since you said Irish Chinese is sweet 😂
01/03/2021, 11:43 - Nischal Abraham: But you like sweet!
01/03/2021, 11:43 - Bee: For dessert definitely. But for a whole meal?!

01/03/2021, 11:50 - Bee: Chinese dessert for dessert?

01/03/2021, 12:22 - Bee: Wondering if I should take a nap
01/03/2021, 12:28 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your nap!
01/03/2021, 13:06 - Bee: Couldn't sleep. Too late to sleep
01/03/2021, 13:07 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/03/2021, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: Well maybe that's why you couldn't sleep 😂
01/03/2021, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: But what is it?
01/03/2021, 13:07 - Bee: I did this after!!
01/03/2021, 13:07 - Bee: That clay mask I've had for a while
01/03/2021, 13:08 - Bee: I'm going to practice using eyeliner Nischal
01/03/2021, 13:08 - Bee: I'll buy a cheap one first. Then once I'm a pro I'll buy good ones
01/03/2021, 13:08 - Bee: Don't want to use good ones if it's crooked and I'm going to wipe it off anyway
01/03/2021, 13:14 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Unlocking a new skill
01/03/2021, 13:19 - Bee: Yep. Saving you from the trouble
01/03/2021, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Of applying eyeliner for you?
01/03/2021, 13:20 - Bee: Yep
01/03/2021, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: Does that mean I don't have to?
01/03/2021, 13:20 - Bee: Yep
01/03/2021, 13:21 - Bee: Unless I'm still drawing crooked lines in a year
01/03/2021, 13:24 - Nischal Abraham: It'll be less crooked than mine 😂
01/03/2021, 14:12 - Bee: Don't underestimate me man
01/03/2021, 14:12 - Bee: <Media omitted>
01/03/2021, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: I think you're overestimating me
01/03/2021, 14:21 - Nischal Abraham: Is that Norah? It's so blurred I can't even make out
01/03/2021, 14:29 - Bee: No that's me. Norah is the one in the larger screen
01/03/2021, 14:47 - Nischal Abraham: How did your conversation go? Did you get to talk to your heart's content?
01/03/2021, 15:35 - Bee: No :( because she was having dinner and then they had to record the hymn
01/03/2021, 15:35 - Bee: Also she was concerned about the clay that was drying up like rocks on my face
01/03/2021, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: That does sound concerning
01/03/2021, 15:40 - Bee: I did tell her that she can't do it with the clay she's got
01/03/2021, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
01/03/2021, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
01/03/2021, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Hahaha she's so definitely going to do it with her clay 😂
01/03/2021, 15:41 - Bee: Thank you!!!!!
01/03/2021, 15:41 - Bee: Looking so good here
01/03/2021, 15:41 - Bee: And here!
01/03/2021, 15:41 - Bee: Noooooo. At least it won't go into her stomach
01/03/2021, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yea that's true. Better on the face than in her mouth
01/03/2021, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: Unless it's some really toxic clay that'll ruin her skin forever and she'll blame you for the rest of her life
01/03/2021, 15:56 - Bee: She can't blame me. I've already told her to not put it on her face
01/03/2021, 15:56 - Bee: What men
01/03/2021, 15:56 - Bee: Also, I have a lawyer friend

01/03/2021, 16:10 - Nischal Abraham: You may win in court but you won't win her heart

01/03/2021, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh I've used a couple that were quite easy to use. The free versions are usually limited in the number of categories you can make but they were more than enough for my needs
01/03/2021, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: I'll look through my app history and let you know
01/03/2021, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: The problem was with me though... I wasn't regular with updating my expenses so couldn't make full use of it
01/03/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Also I'm free now

02/03/2021, 17:32 - Nischal Abraham: For your sake nana. Don't want to make you feel like you need to be on call when you don't want to
02/03/2021, 17:33 - Nischal Abraham: And this doesn't have to be just because your shifts are hectic
02/03/2021, 17:33 - Bee: I don't not want to

07/03/2021, 04:01 - Bee: Hey! Just finished breakfast and ready to go to sleep now. Won't be attending worship or SS :( . I was feverish last night. Must be from the vaccine. And the low ICU temperature made it worse 😔

07/03/2021, 04:01 - Bee: There's not enough staff
07/03/2021, 04:02 - Bee: But it's not Tuesday?

07/03/2021, 04:04 - Bee: You might be attending worship at Noel's/Gareth's. What time will you be leaving from home? If I don't wake up in time then there's no point in me asking you this
07/03/2021, 04:05 - Bee: If I'm up, I'll let you know? For a call. I really want to talk to you nana
07/03/2021, 04:05 - Bee: Nothing specific. Just hearing your voice means a lot

14/03/2021, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be honest I don't remember who else was with me 😶. I could look through my photos and try to figure it out

14/03/2021, 18:53 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to bed now then?

01/04/2021, 13:17 - Bee: I am but knowing that I've got my day off tomorrow is giving me peace
01/04/2021, 13:17 - Bee: It is but I can't wear it to Jason's engagement na
01/04/2021, 13:17 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be taking a nap before Bible study then?
01/04/2021, 13:18 - Nischal Abraham: I guess not. Unless wedding nurse is a new profession you want to start
01/04/2021, 13:20 - Nischal Abraham: That's nice of them. So much for you trying to avoid going
01/04/2021, 13:38 - Bee: Nope. Gonna eat Pani puri
01/04/2021, 13:38 - Bee: What will a wedding nurse do 🤔
01/04/2021, 13:38 - Bee: Dude, food.
01/04/2021, 13:44 - Nischal Abraham: Pani Puri at home?
01/04/2021, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: What does an airport or a school nurse do?
01/04/2021, 13:45 - Nischal Abraham: Food sounds like a good reason to go 😂
01/04/2021, 13:45 - Bee: No... meadows. I hope they're open
01/04/2021, 13:46 - Bee: What does any nurse do?
01/04/2021, 13:47 - Bee: According to Jason, they  give some 4-5 injections and then their back home
01/04/2021, 13:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you'd like that no? Hardly any overtime there
01/04/2021, 13:55 - Bee: If I can give them while I'm seated then sure
01/04/2021, 14:04 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy Bee! Call tonight?

02/04/2021, 08:18 - Bee: What're your plans?
02/04/2021, 09:43 - Nischal Abraham: Finish a cover letter I've put off for a while
02/04/2021, 09:44 - Nischal Abraham: Memorize today's portion and revise the other 2

02/04/2021, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. It was alright. Could've done with some coconut milk
02/04/2021, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Not really. Just listed the things I have coming up
02/04/2021, 09:46 - Bee: Oooh. Ate it with rice?
02/04/2021, 09:46 - Nischal Abraham: Isaiah 52:13-53:3
02/04/2021, 09:46 - Bee: Okay
02/04/2021, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Today I'll eat it with porotta
02/04/2021, 09:47 - Bee: Will it go with porotta?
02/04/2021, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: It's got nothing on it still 😂. But you can see it. It's hosted on unknwnlistener.github.io
02/04/2021, 09:47 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know after lunch today
02/04/2021, 09:48 - Nischal Abraham: Done cleaning the house?

02/04/2021, 09:48 - Bee: Yesssss
02/04/2021, 09:48 - Bee: One bathroom remaining. Ashley's duty.
02/04/2021, 09:49 - Bee: I like a clean house
02/04/2021, 09:49 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you don't trust him with bathroom cleaning
02/04/2021, 09:49 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 09:49 - Bee: I don't buy I don't want to be the one doing it. I always do it
02/04/2021, 09:50 - Bee: But*
02/04/2021, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: Fair enough
02/04/2021, 09:50 - Nischal Abraham: What. I said it has nothing on it
02/04/2021, 09:51 - Nischal Abraham: That's for you to track progress. Over time it'll change. Hopefully for the better
02/04/2021, 10:05 - Bee: I will keep opening it man
02/04/2021, 10:05 - Bee: I'm yet to have lunch
02/04/2021, 10:10 - Nischal Abraham: Busy cleaning?
02/04/2021, 10:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 10:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 10:30 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 10:33 - Nischal Abraham: Aww. It looks like Norah's being scolded
02/04/2021, 11:08 - Bee: No no
02/04/2021, 11:08 - Bee: This is to show how big Sammy's stomach has gotten
02/04/2021, 11:09 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. It isn't too bad if you ask me. Sitting at home isn't helping his case I'm guessing
02/04/2021, 11:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 11:20 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 11:20 - Bee: 😂
02/04/2021, 11:20 - Bee: Noooo it's all of the staycations
02/04/2021, 11:49 - Bee: Gonna keep
02/04/2021, 11:49 - Bee: Nap
02/04/2021, 11:49 - Bee: Byyee
02/04/2021, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your nap!
02/04/2021, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
02/04/2021, 13:33 - Bee: Leaving for Thane station
02/04/2021, 13:33 - Bee: Enjoyed my nap
02/04/2021, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Buying new jeans?
02/04/2021, 13:34 - Nischal Abraham: Porotta tastes good with anything it seems 😋
02/04/2021, 14:54 - Bee: And to pick up my kurta thing and the watches maa gave for repair
02/04/2021, 14:54 - Bee: Didn't buy jeans. Didn't like any. There's hardly any options without rips
02/04/2021, 14:59 - Nischal Abraham: Are you back home already?
02/04/2021, 15:14 - Bee: I am
02/04/2021, 15:14 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 15:14 - Bee: Ignore the hair
02/04/2021, 15:14 - Bee: It needs to be altered a little more I think
02/04/2021, 15:29 - Bee: The moment I saw it I realized that the Color isn't what I remembered
02/04/2021, 15:35 - Nischal Abraham: Silver blue looks exactly like what you described it
02/04/2021, 15:35 - Bee: Is it nixe?
02/04/2021, 15:35 - Bee: Nice
02/04/2021, 15:36 - Bee: Do you like it?
02/04/2021, 15:36 - Bee: Wait I'll send a photo of the whole thing
02/04/2021, 15:36 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 15:36 - Bee: ..
02/04/2021, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: It looks beautiful. Almost as much as the person wearing it
02/04/2021, 15:37 - Nischal Abraham: The length of it?
02/04/2021, 15:37 - Bee: No. Around my waist. It's a little loose. I'm holding it at the back in the photo
02/04/2021, 15:37 - Bee: Is it too long?
02/04/2021, 15:37 - Bee: I think the length is alright
02/04/2021, 15:38 - Bee: Thank you nana. :)
02/04/2021, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: I see what you mean by transparent dark blue now
02/04/2021, 15:38 - Bee: Yessss
02/04/2021, 15:38 - Bee: The color stands out only when it is bunched up
02/04/2021, 15:38 - Nischal Abraham: I wouldn't know 😂. If I'm getting anything altered it's usually jeans and the only reason is length
02/04/2021, 15:39 - Nischal Abraham: So when you said altered that's all I associated it with
02/04/2021, 15:42 - Bee: Ahhhh
02/04/2021, 15:42 - Bee: <Media omitted>
02/04/2021, 15:43 - Nischal Abraham: Only difference I see is blurred hands. I'm sure you've got a point. Will you be sending it back for altering then? Would it be done in time for the engagement?
02/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: Ill check with a local tailor instead of going all the way there
02/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: It will be done in time
02/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: Going to meet Reenee now
02/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: Jason is joining along
02/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: How's your day going?
02/04/2021, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: Went out for a walk. Super sunny day today
02/04/2021, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: Other than that it's been pretty uneventful. Going to sit down and tick some stuff off my list

03/04/2021, 19:11 - Bee: Definitely isn't

04/04/2021, 22:29 - Nischal Abraham: Do you have much planned for the morning?
04/04/2021, 22:30 - Nischal Abraham: I love you too Bee ♥️
04/04/2021, 22:30 - Nischal Abraham: I was at Timon's after a walk with Heather and Noel. We played some Age of Empires
04/04/2021, 22:30 - Nischal Abraham: Oh and he made lassi which was quite nice 😊
04/04/2021, 22:33 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
05/04/2021, 07:29 - Bee: Good morning!
05/04/2021, 07:29 - Bee: Some gardening with Jason. Which is done
05/04/2021, 07:29 - Bee: Just you two? Also, Noel seems like the youngest of all
05/04/2021, 07:30 - Bee: Ooh wow. Did it put you in a drowsy daze after?
05/04/2021, 08:39 - Nischal Abraham: At Timon's it was just us 2
05/04/2021, 08:39 - Nischal Abraham: What's a drowsy daze?
05/04/2021, 08:40 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. You must be leaving soon for your shift I suppose
05/04/2021, 08:42 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you have an uneventful evening 😊. We may not be able to be on a call tonight either. It's Wesley from Fairview's birthday and Cherian has organized a video call for it at 7pm today
05/04/2021, 08:43 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you are back home and feel up to a call before that I'd love to talk to you. Let me know either way
05/04/2021, 17:59 - Bee: Hey!
05/04/2021, 17:59 - Bee: Got back home a few minutes ago. Gonna have dinner now
05/04/2021, 18:01 - Nischal Abraham: Hii! How was your day?
05/04/2021, 18:12 - Bee: It was alright. Another uneventful day 😊
05/04/2021, 18:12 - Bee: The daze one's in after drinking heavy sweet lassi
05/04/2021, 18:13 - Bee: Oh! How old is he turning?
05/04/2021, 18:13 - Bee: Isn't that in 45 minutes?
05/04/2021, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Never happened to me. Don't know what kinda lassi you've been drinking
05/04/2021, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: 85
05/04/2021, 18:23 - Nischal Abraham: Less now
05/04/2021, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Heading to bed yet?
05/04/2021, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Or headed already I guess. The birthday call is done. It was lovely seeing old faces although it was over a screen
05/04/2021, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: Would've been wonderful to be enjoying that meeting in person
05/04/2021, 19:31 - Nischal Abraham: What's plans for the day in the morning?
05/04/2021, 19:31 - Bee: Hey :)
05/04/2021, 19:31 - Bee: In bed. Will sleep in a bit
05/04/2021, 19:32 - Bee: I'm sure. Are there restrictions for meets outside even now?
05/04/2021, 19:32 - Nischal Abraham: Situation in Ireland hasn't changed since Jan nana
05/04/2021, 19:32 - Bee: Misal pav plans. It's a maybe. Depends on when we three wake up and if the shops are open
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Bee: Oh. Because UK is opening up quite a lot no
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Though there's talks of slightly less restrictions from next week on. That just means travel expands to within the country
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: County*
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Bee: That's why I thought maybe Ireland as well
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yep they are. They seem to be moving forward quite a bit faster than Ireland
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Bee: Ahhh. Almost the same thing now no?
05/04/2021, 19:33 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
05/04/2021, 19:34 - Bee: Also, did you watch The Chosen's latest episode?
05/04/2021, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: So it isn't really much of a difference. Well any change that doesn't open churches will be the same to me
05/04/2021, 19:34 - Nischal Abraham: I did. Before our call and before my shower
05/04/2021, 19:34 - Bee: Ahh. How did you like it?
05/04/2021, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: I was in tears in the first 10 min. There's a lot of reminders to the first season that led me to that I think
05/04/2021, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: What did you think of it?
05/04/2021, 19:36 - Bee: Aww. I look forward to watching it
05/04/2021, 19:36 - Bee: Haven't watched it yet
05/04/2021, 19:36 - Bee: Will watch it on my day off
05/04/2021, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. Or will you be waiting till the whole season is out?
05/04/2021, 19:37 - Bee: I'm thinking I might. I don't want to wait long between two episodes
05/04/2021, 19:38 - Bee: Do you know when the next one's gonna come out?
05/04/2021, 19:38 - Nischal Abraham: So he announced that they'll release each episode as soon as they're ready. The next one's coming out sometime this week
05/04/2021, 19:39 - Bee: Ooh. How many episodes this season?
05/04/2021, 19:40 - Nischal Abraham: No idea
05/04/2021, 19:45 - Bee: Okay
05/04/2021, 19:47 - Nischal Abraham: How are you Bee?
05/04/2021, 19:52 - Bee: I am alright nana. 7/10
05/04/2021, 19:52 - Bee: How are youM
05/04/2021, 19:52 - Bee: ?*
05/04/2021, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: Good today. I'd say 7 tok
05/04/2021, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: Too*
05/04/2021, 19:53 - Bee: Work website?
05/04/2021, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: Just one of those days where I really really miss you
05/04/2021, 19:53 - Nischal Abraham: No progress on website or work
05/04/2021, 19:54 - Bee: Aww nana. What's up? You okay?
05/04/2021, 19:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'm okay. It's just all the talk of engagements and marriage that makes me wish I was already at ours
05/04/2021, 19:55 - Bee: But we can have only 50 people if we have it now
05/04/2021, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: Perfect
05/04/2021, 19:55 - Bee: And it can't be in Ireland no
05/04/2021, 19:55 - Nischal Abraham: Maybe even less than 50 😂
05/04/2021, 19:55 - Bee: And honeymoon would be in Kasara or Titwala because travel restrictions
05/04/2021, 19:55 - Bee: 😂
05/04/2021, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: Ireland would be difficult with the current environment. Travelling in general is difficult and the fewer people that have to do it the better
05/04/2021, 19:56 - Bee: But I know where we'll get our cake from. One thing is sorted
05/04/2021, 19:56 - Nischal Abraham: Where's that?
05/04/2021, 19:56 - Bee: Unless you have suggestions
05/04/2021, 19:57 - Bee: Arundhati can bake it. My friend Arundhati who baked maa's birthday cake
05/04/2021, 19:57 - Bee: Red velvet with cream cheese. You don't have to eat a lot of it since you don't like it
05/04/2021, 19:57 - Nischal Abraham: Oh yea. Definitely. But I thought we weren't having a cake
05/04/2021, 19:58 - Bee: Our guests aren't having cake. Or anything to do with cake. It's for _our_ after party
05/04/2021, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: Ah right right. Of course
05/04/2021, 19:59 - Bee: I miss you too nana. I feel like fast forwarding through these years when we're apart. And it's you who reminds me that each experience is important and we must not hurry through each new phase in life. Which you already lnow
05/04/2021, 19:59 - Bee: Know*
05/04/2021, 19:59 - Nischal Abraham: I know. I know what I know but I feel so differently from it so often
05/04/2021, 20:00 - Bee: Also, it's terribly hot so we can't have an outdoors thing now
05/04/2021, 20:01 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. When I said ours should be sooner I didn't mean the wedding date would move back but that time would move us forward to it
05/04/2021, 20:02 - Nischal Abraham: Just wishful thinking Bee. I love the experiences we are enjoying now too.
05/04/2021, 20:03 - Bee: Yeah. Why aren't you 27 and why am I not 25 years old?!??!?!!!??!!!!
05/04/2021, 20:03 - Nischal Abraham: These are just the days my chest hurts from missing you so. And no, it's not a medical problem
05/04/2021, 20:04 - Bee: Relieved to hear that it's not a medical problem. Your chest hurting thing sounds a lot like how feel often
05/04/2021, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Soon enough
05/04/2021, 20:04 - Bee: I*
05/04/2021, 20:04 - Nischal Abraham: Is that a medical problem?
05/04/2021, 20:05 - Bee: Not as sooner as we want it to be
05/04/2021, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: Should you be sleeping now? What time is the misal pav expedition?
05/04/2021, 20:07 - Bee: It will happen only if we wake up before 8:30
05/04/2021, 20:07 - Nischal Abraham: Will you not?
05/04/2021, 20:09 - Bee: We'll find out tomorrow
05/04/2021, 20:10 - Bee: I cannot predict what time I'm gonna wake up. Even on days when I really want to wake up early, there's no telling where I will. I sleep through alarms and wake up in a panick after
05/04/2021, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like you're sleeping well!
05/04/2021, 20:10 - Bee: Holds true for when I have evening shifts. And days ofd
05/04/2021, 20:10 - Nischal Abraham: I think that's a good sign
05/04/2021, 20:11 - Bee: My mind is going to a rough place. About how I don't deserve you and stuff. And the chest hurting thing is happening
05/04/2021, 20:12 - Bee: I'm not expecting consolation from you. But it happens more often than I'd like and I think one way to hold it at bay is to mention to you each time it happens
05/04/2021, 20:12 - Bee: Not expecting a response. It's okay.
05/04/2021, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: Okay. I'll be hear to hear it every time
05/04/2021, 20:12 - Nischal Abraham: I wish there was more I could do
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Bee: Didn't mean to ruin (did I?) your night. Just want you to know.
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Bee: Thank you nana.
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: Or less I could do? Maybe then you'll think I don't deserve you 😂
05/04/2021, 20:13 - Nischal Abraham: And that could balance things out!
05/04/2021, 20:21 - Bee: 😂
05/04/2021, 20:23 - Nischal Abraham: No I've seen that before. Makes for a toxic relationship
05/04/2021, 20:23 - Nischal Abraham: We'll learn and grow. Praying about it
05/04/2021, 20:27 - Bee: I'm dreading each day that you find out about a shortcoming of mine. There's just so many Nischal. Tiny things and bug things
05/04/2021, 20:27 - Bee: Big*
05/04/2021, 20:28 - Nischal Abraham: What about me finding out affects you most?
05/04/2021, 20:28 - Bee: I just pray that God extends His mercy and love through you to me through all of it
05/04/2021, 20:29 - Bee: I don't want you to feel like you're stuck Nischal
05/04/2021, 20:30 - Nischal Abraham: I've felt stuck and the fault has always been my own. And the ways I make myself do that have been quite terrible so if you manage to top that I'll be surprised to say the least
05/04/2021, 20:30 - Bee: What if one day you feel like you deserved better? What then? Too late to change anything
05/04/2021, 20:31 - Nischal Abraham: But this will be my prayer too. And that He also extends mercy and love through everything else around you cause I don't feel I measure up
05/04/2021, 20:32 - Nischal Abraham: We'll change. Growing is changing. Learning is too. I can't wait for the days when we can do it together with each other
05/04/2021, 20:43 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee. I love you and miss you loads. God's love is ever greater than mine and every passing day just amazes me to think that greater love exists. I learnt that from you :)
05/04/2021, 21:07 - Bee: I don't know what to say Nischal. Except that I'm undeserving of your kindness which you show in word and deed. Thank you.
05/04/2021, 21:07 - Nischal Abraham: What you should be saying is 💤
05/04/2021, 21:07 - Bee: Yeah. Goodnight
05/04/2021, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: ♥️
05/04/2021, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: I still don't believe you're undeserving
05/04/2021, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: But misal pav should conquer all doubts at night
05/04/2021, 21:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'm here for you any time Bee. If you're having trouble falling asleep. I didn't mean to say I don't want to talk
05/04/2021, 21:13 - Bee: I don't think misal pav is happening tomorrow. Messaged my brothers telling them to wake me up whenever they do.
05/04/2021, 21:13 - Bee: Oh. For a moment there it felt like you had enough of my trash talks. I wouldn't blame you
05/04/2021, 21:13 - Bee: But I should go to sleep now. I will try to
05/04/2021, 21:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm a far cry away from having enough of hearing about you
05/04/2021, 21:14 - Bee: Thank you for all your replies Nischal
05/04/2021, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: Okay :). I hope you get a good night's sleep
05/04/2021, 21:14 - Bee: Thank you. Goodnight :)
05/04/2021, 21:14 - Bee: You too.
05/04/2021, 21:14 - Nischal Abraham: And I'll do it again
06/04/2021, 08:08 - Bee: Hey! There's class at 1 today so I'll be leaving early
06/04/2021, 08:08 - Bee: Hope you have a good day 😊
06/04/2021, 08:11 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks Bee 😊. I hope you have a wonderful day too
06/04/2021, 18:20 - Bee: Hey!
06/04/2021, 18:20 - Bee: Late day at work
06/04/2021, 18:20 - Bee: Back home and eating dinner now
06/04/2021, 18:21 - Bee: How's your day going?
06/04/2021, 18:21 - Bee: Finished work no
06/04/2021, 18:35 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! Yea I'm done with work for the day
06/04/2021, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Ate some chocolate cake that Annie made on Sunday
06/04/2021, 18:36 - Nischal Abraham: Normal office work day. We had a full house in the office so everyone was in
06/04/2021, 18:49 - Bee: Ahhh. Panini Tuesday?
06/04/2021, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: No panini today
06/04/2021, 18:49 - Bee: Have the dates for the rest of prize giving been set?
06/04/2021, 18:49 - Bee: Oh why? Folks went home for lunch?
06/04/2021, 18:49 - Nischal Abraham: There's no more zoom calls for prizegiving. Just sending an email to the schools
06/04/2021, 18:50 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. And Gareth only came by after lunch
06/04/2021, 19:01 - Bee: Ahhh
06/04/2021, 19:01 - Bee: I haven't finished dinner yet
06/04/2021, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Tired?
06/04/2021, 19:02 - Bee: A little bit yes
06/04/2021, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: Too tired to eat!
06/04/2021, 19:02 - Nischal Abraham: ?*
06/04/2021, 19:02 - Bee: Yep
06/04/2021, 19:04 - Nischal Abraham: Is messaging slowing you down?
06/04/2021, 19:04 - Bee: Not really. I'm on Instagram anyway
06/04/2021, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: Ah but Instagram is just you watching
06/04/2021, 19:06 - Nischal Abraham: You up for a call tonight?

07/04/2021, 08:39 - Bee: I did have class. Got a message in the morning saying it's cancelled
07/04/2021, 08:39 - Bee: What're your plans?
07/04/2021, 08:39 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay okay
07/04/2021, 08:39 - Nischal Abraham: Job applications, website development, waste time that I will regret later
07/04/2021, 08:40 - Nischal Abraham: The usual 😂
07/04/2021, 08:40 - Nischal Abraham: I'll probably work in the office a bit in the morning. There's the school PG stuff I still need to sort out
07/04/2021, 08:40 - Bee: What men
07/04/2021, 08:40 - Bee: I want to see the website!!

07/04/2021, 08:41 - Bee: Nope. Will have in 20 mins
07/04/2021, 08:41 - Bee: And toast?
07/04/2021, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: Isn't it almost 2 already?
07/04/2021, 08:41 - Bee: It's 1:09
07/04/2021, 08:41 - Nischal Abraham: Ran out of bread. I'll have it with a wrap
07/04/2021, 08:42 - Bee: Okay
07/04/2021, 08:42 - Nischal Abraham: Which reminds me I need to go shopping as well

07/04/2021, 08:42 - Bee: Much to do

07/04/2021, 17:39 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! That's cool. How was your day today?
07/04/2021, 17:43 - Bee: A little busy but not too bad 😊
07/04/2021, 17:43 - Bee: How's your day going?
07/04/2021, 17:44 - Bee: Sitting down for dinner now. There's chicken crispy. Everyone waited for me to come and were eating together ☺️

09/04/2021, 11:26 - Nischal Abraham: Well it's neither of their birthdays today. But Megha and I were planning to get a bunch of school friends on a call tomorrow and I think this just happened spontaneously
09/04/2021, 12:33 - Nischal Abraham: What's plans for the rest of the day?
09/04/2021, 12:40 - Bee: Birthday call is happening tomorrow then?
09/04/2021, 12:41 - Bee: Papa, maa, Cilu mama (he's home with us because he's going to Mangalore too and they're all going together), and I are visiting a nursery in Teen Hast Naka to look at some plants for the old age home project
09/04/2021, 12:41 - Bee: What're you doing? Still working?
09/04/2021, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: That's the plan
09/04/2021, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: Ooh nice

09/04/2021, 13:13 - Bee: What part of the website are you working on?
09/04/2021, 13:14 - Bee: <Media omitted>

09/04/2021, 13:55 - Nischal Abraham: Not chubby but she does have more hair now. Still toothless too, I don't know at what age babies get teeth
09/04/2021, 13:56 - Nischal Abraham: All of it. I've decided on just adding my Resume information in and then designing can come later

11/04/2021, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry I don't have anymore to add to that. Just one of those nights where I'd do well to switch off all my devices and head to bed early.
11/04/2021, 21:48 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know tomorrow how things are around lunch for a call. Goodnight Bee!

16/04/2021, 18:19 - Bee: I'll call?
16/04/2021, 21:42 - Bee: Reading this message I assumed that there is no game night (wrong of me to assume that, I'm sorry) which led me to believe that we can take our time and talk tonight. If I knew game night was on, I would've tried to get on the call earlier (again, my bad). But it was a little hurtful that game night was chosen over the call considering we haven't gotten to talk properly for a while. I know game night is only once a week and I also know I should be more understanding but it does hurt. 
You must be in the middle of a game rn. I had decided to share this with you after you finish playing but holding it in won't do any good. I want to tell you how I feel as I feel it. 
I might be in the wrong here. Please let me know.
16/04/2021, 21:54 - Bee: I'm sorry that I'm putting a damper on your mood.
16/04/2021, 22:09 - Nischal Abraham: Hey
16/04/2021, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: You're not in the wrong Bee. I probably should've stayed on a longer call
16/04/2021, 22:12 - Nischal Abraham: Are you still up?
16/04/2021, 22:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sorry. I didn't know you thought there was no game night. I probably should've phrased it better
16/04/2021, 22:14 - Nischal Abraham: Bee. If you are up could you call me?
16/04/2021, 22:20 - Bee: Hi
16/04/2021, 22:20 - Bee: I'll call?
16/04/2021, 22:21 - Nischal Abraham: Yep!
16/04/2021, 23:11 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/04/2021, 23:12 - Nischal Abraham: <Media omitted>
16/04/2021, 23:21 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/04/2021, 23:21 - Bee: <Media omitted>
16/04/2021, 23:22 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/04/2021, 09:13 - Nischal Abraham: Good morning beautiful! Did you sleep alright?
17/04/2021, 09:55 - Nischal Abraham: https://youtu.be/ybPgmjTRvMo
17/04/2021, 10:21 - Bee: Hey :))))))
17/04/2021, 10:22 - Bee: I slept alright. Woke up at 10:30. Had breakfast and started to clean the house but the electricity went out so no WiFi and I didn't want to clean the house without music so I was lazing around for a bit
17/04/2021, 10:23 - Bee: Electricity came back on around 12. Started cooking. Made rice, Dal, and carrot thoran. All within an hour!!!!! It was really fun. I was sipping on iced tea and the music was on while I was cooking
17/04/2021, 10:23 - Bee: Cleaned the house after. I need to clean the bathrooms and wash my uniform
17/04/2021, 10:23 - Bee: Will have lunch now and then clean some moee
17/04/2021, 10:23 - Bee: More
17/04/2021, 10:24 - Bee: Did you sleep okay? How's your cold? Do you have a headache? :(
17/04/2021, 10:27 - Nischal Abraham: I slept well! No headache, just the runny nose still
17/04/2021, 10:27 - Nischal Abraham: That is very impressive 😮
17/04/2021, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a lot of cleaning. I'm done with breakfast as well and deciding on what to do for the day. It's hard to motivate myself when my head feels heavy
17/04/2021, 10:29 - Nischal Abraham: Well I find it hard to motivate myself regardless but this is just added excuse 😂
17/04/2021, 11:22 - Bee: Helloooooo
17/04/2021, 11:23 - Bee: Steam!!!
17/04/2021, 11:23 - Bee: Ikr?! Thanks nana. I was impressed as well
17/04/2021, 11:23 - Bee: Just sit down and get started nana
17/04/2021, 11:24 - Bee: I spoke to Sahil for a while in the morning. And just got off a call with Ruth
17/04/2021, 11:24 - Bee: Finished lunch. Had leftover Chinese. I ate a lot but I don't feel full
17/04/2021, 11:24 - Bee: Will get to the bathrooms a little later. Don't feel like it rn
17/04/2021, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: Oh nice! How's Sahil doing? It feels like its been forever since I've spoken to him. I'll take steam now
17/04/2021, 11:31 - Nischal Abraham: I'm not sure what to get started on Bee... Finding it hard to focus
17/04/2021, 11:35 - Bee: He said he's alright. He's finished 4 months of work already man
17/04/2021, 11:36 - Bee: Website? Job stuff? Study? I will sit down with you on video call if you want
17/04/2021, 11:39 - Nischal Abraham: Well I'll start with taking some steam. Then I'd love to get on a the call. Though looking at the time I could probably make something for lunch
17/04/2021, 11:42 - Nischal Abraham: And I mean I can be on call with you while prepping lunch. If you're free for it
17/04/2021, 11:42 - Bee: I am free :)
17/04/2021, 11:42 - Bee: Let me know when you start
17/04/2021, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: Hey!
17/04/2021, 11:50 - Nischal Abraham: I'll call?
17/04/2021, 12:00 - Bee: <Media omitted>
17/04/2021, 12:01 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
17/04/2021, 12:10 - Bee: Missed video call
17/04/2021, 13:37 - Bee: Bebe
17/04/2021, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee 😂
17/04/2021, 13:38 - Bee: This is what you think bb is
17/04/2021, 13:38 - Bee: Done cooking?
17/04/2021, 13:38 - Bee: How's the dal?
17/04/2021, 13:38 - Nischal Abraham: Yep. Done with lunch too. Sandeep from college sent a message to catch up so will be getting on a call with him in 5 min
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Bee: Cool cool
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: It's alright. Really missing on curry patta. I can't seem to get it to taste as good as when I made it in Kilcock
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Bee: We didn't find any jalebi
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: Don't even know if there is an alternative to curry patta
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Bee: Dude. Is it possible for you to get a plant? It may survive indoors no?
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Nischal Abraham: Because its Saturday?
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Bee: By the window of course
17/04/2021, 13:39 - Bee: I think so yes
17/04/2021, 13:40 - Bee: I didn't know that was a thing
17/04/2021, 13:40 - Bee: I don't think there is
17/04/2021, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: It is since the new lockdown rules kicked in
17/04/2021, 13:40 - Nischal Abraham: The plant will survive the weather... I doubt it'll survive me
17/04/2021, 13:41 - Bee: Nooo some shops are open until 7
17/04/2021, 13:41 - Bee: But they don't have jalebi
17/04/2021, 13:42 - Bee: It will. They're low maintenance. We have one and we hardly do anything to take care of it
17/04/2021, 13:42 - Nischal Abraham: Oh... So did you get some other sweet then?
17/04/2021, 13:51 - Bee: Nope. Didn't feel like having anything else
17/04/2021, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. Haven't received a reply from Sandeep so if you want to get on a call let me know
17/04/2021, 13:52 - Nischal Abraham: But we may be cut off abruptly whenever I do get a reply from him
17/04/2021, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: I want to call home as well but I don't want to cut that off abruptly so I'll do that after my call with Sandeep
17/04/2021, 16:05 - Nischal Abraham: Hello again, spoke to everyone I wanted to talk to. So there's nothing else to do for the rest of the day
17/04/2021, 16:06 - Nischal Abraham: Hope you're enjoying a call with Anjali!
17/04/2021, 17:15 - Bee: Hey!
17/04/2021, 17:15 - Bee: Spoke to her for a bit
17/04/2021, 17:15 - Bee: She's quite bored there
17/04/2021, 17:15 - Bee: How are the parents doing!
17/04/2021, 17:15 - Bee: ?*
17/04/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Parents are well. Not much news there other than the rising cases of covid in India
17/04/2021, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: No further news on Nikhil's wedding either. Nothings been booked yet. They're waiting a while longer to see how the situation changes
17/04/2021, 17:21 - Bee: That's the wise thing to do. The situation may change anytime
17/04/2021, 17:21 - Bee: What are you doing?
17/04/2021, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: Just finished cleaning the dishes
17/04/2021, 17:24 - Nischal Abraham: What are you doing?
17/04/2021, 17:26 - Bee: I am eating dinner nana
17/04/2021, 17:26 - Nischal Abraham: Cool cool. What's for dinner?
17/04/2021, 17:28 - Bee: Some leftover nasi goreng rice,l
17/04/2021, 17:28 - Bee: And Dal, rice, carrot thoran
17/04/2021, 17:29 - Bee: I don't like eating what I've cooked. Because I've already tasted it so many times while cooking. And I am my own biggest critic when it comes to cooking
17/04/2021, 17:31 - Nischal Abraham: Well if you know what can be improved then it works out well no?
17/04/2021, 17:36 - Nischal Abraham: What shift tomorrow?
17/04/2021, 17:37 - Bee: Somewhat. But I don't always know how to correct it
17/04/2021, 17:37 - Bee: I don't know yet. I've asked for the duty list
17/04/2021, 17:41 - Bee: Morning duty tomorrow. 😭
17/04/2021, 17:48 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. You'll have the whole rest of the day to yourself!
17/04/2021, 17:48 - Bee: Yeah that's true. But I'll have to wake up early
17/04/2021, 17:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yea... Early bedtime tonight then?
17/04/2021, 17:51 - Bee: No not tonight. I've rested enough today. Early bedtime from tomorrow
17/04/2021, 17:51 - Bee: I'm still eating dinner
17/04/2021, 17:53 - Nischal Abraham: Did you take a nap today?
17/04/2021, 17:53 - Bee: I did. Accidentally.
17/04/2021, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂. Got too comfy in your freshly laid out sheets
17/04/2021, 18:19 - Bee: Yes 😂
17/04/2021, 18:19 - Bee: What is up?
17/04/2021, 18:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'm just waiting till the time we can be on call
17/04/2021, 20:03 - Bee: Im so proud of you
17/04/2021, 20:03 - Bee: Im really happy for you
17/04/2021, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
17/04/2021, 20:05 - Nischal Abraham: Tell him to keep it on the down low
17/04/2021, 20:05 - Bee: Oh yes
17/04/2021, 20:05 - Bee: I forgot
17/04/2021, 22:28 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! Praying you have a wonderful day tomorrow. Hope you get the rest you need tonight. Thank you so much for all the calls we could share today
18/04/2021, 01:45 - Bee: Thank you for being available bb.
18/04/2021, 01:46 - Bee: I didn't sleep well because it was so hot. :( Kept waking up. Definitely sleeping with the AC on tonight onwards. Wondering what it feels like to love in a country where it's always cold.
18/04/2021, 01:46 - Bee: Live*
18/04/2021, 01:46 - Bee: Praying for you and for your cold to go away.
18/04/2021, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for prayers nana. Feeling much better this morning. I've decided to go to Gareth's for worship and hopefully will still be well enough for lunch at Noel's
18/04/2021, 08:54 - Nischal Abraham: How was your shift?
18/04/2021, 08:55 - Nischal Abraham: Love fills me with warmth in a cold country. But mostly the duvet does 😂. Well I don't worry about sweating at all so that's nice for me
18/04/2021, 12:08 - Bee: Be careful okay.
18/04/2021, 12:08 - Bee: Uneventful! 😊
18/04/2021, 12:09 - Bee: Had a full lunch. Feels like I'm sedated. Will take a nap now
18/04/2021, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: I was. And it was a lovely time! Just came back to No 5 now. Didn't think I should stay on any longer than I had
18/04/2021, 14:51 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds lovely. Do you know what shift you have tomorrow?
18/04/2021, 14:52 - Nischal Abraham: I feel the same too. But afternoon naps just ruin my night sleep so I'd rather just stay up now
18/04/2021, 15:04 - Bee: I've got morning shifts for the week
18/04/2021, 15:05 - Bee: How's your cold?
18/04/2021, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Much better today than it was yesterday
18/04/2021, 15:05 - Nischal Abraham: Are you done with your nap?
18/04/2021, 15:33 - Bee: Yep 😊
18/04/2021, 15:33 - Bee: No headache?
18/04/2021, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: Nope. The head's clear. Just the stuffy nose left to clear up
18/04/2021, 15:34 - Nischal Abraham: I bought a paracetamol yesterday just in case but haven't needed it
18/04/2021, 15:37 - Bee: That's a relief to hear 😊 no throat issues either?
18/04/2021, 15:37 - Bee: Ben asked me why I felt like I couldn't tell him sooner
18/04/2021, 15:37 - Bee: I don't know what to say
18/04/2021, 15:40 - Nischal Abraham: Throat's fine too
18/04/2021, 15:41 - Nischal Abraham: What do you feel is the reason you didn't tell him sooner?
18/04/2021, 15:42 - Bee: I thought he might tell other people
18/04/2021, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Well that might sound rude saying it like that 😅. We were keeping it on the down low from everybody
18/04/2021, 15:47 - Nischal Abraham: The only people who knew were people around us at the time
18/04/2021, 15:47 - Bee: But we told Sahil 8ish months ago
18/04/2021, 15:48 - Nischal Abraham: True, but that was more because I told Juliet aunty cause she's close to family
18/04/2021, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: I think it's more along the lines of there were no plans made for our future and we were just praying about it for a long while
18/04/2021, 15:49 - Nischal Abraham: And it was a secret from as many people as could be
18/04/2021, 15:49 - Bee: I will tell him that
18/04/2021, 15:52 - Nischal Abraham: I'm sure he'll understand. I thought he's happy for us
18/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: That he is
18/04/2021, 15:52 - Bee: I would've been upset with him too. If he waited so long to give me a big life update
18/04/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Yea. I think he deserves this one
18/04/2021, 15:55 - Bee: ☹️
18/04/2021, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Hey you can't stop him from being upset. That's up to him. But you also can't change the past. You've told him now and you can either move on to celebrate it or mope what could have been
18/04/2021, 15:58 - Nischal Abraham: Apologize if you think you're in the wrong. Ask him if he has a big life secret he's yet to tell you
18/04/2021, 16:11 - Bee: I did apologize
18/04/2021, 16:11 - Bee: I will ask him 😊
18/04/2021, 16:12 - Nischal Abraham: Call tonight?
18/04/2021, 16:12 - Bee: Agreed. He'll understand and be fine eventually
18/04/2021, 16:12 - Bee: Yep!
18/04/2021, 16:14 - Nischal Abraham: Cool 😊. Looking forward to it. I'm free whenever you are
18/04/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Dude
18/04/2021, 17:16 - Bee: What's up,m
18/04/2021, 17:16 - Bee: ?*
18/04/2021, 17:16 - Bee: I'm eating dinner
18/04/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: I'm watching a movie. Didn't want to sleep after I came back so started one. Ford v Ferrari
18/04/2021, 17:18 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/04/2021, 17:18 - Bee: Enjoying?
18/04/2021, 17:18 - Bee: Nice movie?
18/04/2021, 17:18 - Bee: Hasn't that been on your watch list for a loonngg time?
18/04/2021, 17:19 - Bee: <Media omitted>
18/04/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: It's a nice movie! And it has been on the list for a while. Daniel had recommended it
18/04/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: Why is your dad so shocked? 😂
18/04/2021, 17:19 - Bee: Danny boy?
18/04/2021, 17:19 - Nischal Abraham: No no. Dan Kell
18/04/2021, 17:19 - Bee: Daniel Hannah's dad?
18/04/2021, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: Looks lovely Bee 😋. You must be tired of eating the same thing a third time though
18/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: I told him to look at the food like it's the most delicious thing ever. This was him doing it 😶
18/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Kinda yes. New menu for tomorrow
18/04/2021, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣. Could be used for a YouTube thumbnail
18/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Papa will make sambhar. I want to try avial
18/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: 😂
18/04/2021, 17:21 - Nischal Abraham: You've got ingredients for avial?
18/04/2021, 17:22 - Bee: Nope. There's no veggies at home. Will be going shopping tomorrow after work
18/04/2021, 17:22 - Bee: You watch your movie nana. I will let you know when I'm done?
18/04/2021, 17:23 - Nischal Abraham: Ah alright. Sure thing. Don't spend an hour eating love. You can talk with your dad even with an empty plate 😁
18/04/2021, 17:59 - Bee: Hey:)))
18/04/2021, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Hi!
18/04/2021, 17:59 - Bee: I'll call?
19/04/2021, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee! How's your day been?
19/04/2021, 11:24 - Nischal Abraham: I hope shift wasn't too tiring this morning. Do you have plans for the rest of the day?
19/04/2021, 11:25 - Nischal Abraham: I'm feeling the same as yesterday. Thanking God it still hasn't gotten worse. Although I had a restless night and took a while to fall asleep
19/04/2021, 11:27 - Nischal Abraham: Work week starts again. This week and next are busy office weeks so I'll have my hands full of things to get done. There's reading of Nehemiah tonight at 8 with the book club
19/04/2021, 12:31 - Bee: Good afternoon, love!
19/04/2021, 12:31 - Bee: Work was alright. Not too busy
19/04/2021, 12:36 - Bee: Having sambhar and rice for lunch
19/04/2021, 12:36 - Bee: Thank God it hasn't gotten worse 😌
19/04/2021, 12:36 - Bee: Busy because end of the month or because prize giving?
19/04/2021, 12:42 - Nischal Abraham: A bit of both. The PG busyness will continue till the end of the month as well so I guess this month is just extra busy
19/04/2021, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: There was a time that combination didn't make sense to me. But I've reached a point in life where that just sounds so good 🤤
19/04/2021, 12:43 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to hear it 😊. Will you be taking a nap now?
19/04/2021, 12:44 - Bee: Once I'm done eating I'd like to take a nap
19/04/2021, 12:45 - Bee: Sabhar and rice didn't make sense to you?!?!?!?!?!?!!!???
19/04/2021, 12:45 - Bee: Busiest month in PBS no
19/04/2021, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: Nope it didn't. Sambhar is breakfast food
19/04/2021, 13:04 - Nischal Abraham: End of December and start of Jan felt busier than it is now
19/04/2021, 14:06 - Bee: Sambhar has alway gone with rice for me. And breakfast dishes as well
19/04/2021, 14:07 - Bee: Ahh. Because new year's break and all that you had to do before and after
19/04/2021, 14:12 - Nischal Abraham: It did for everyone else in the family too. I was the odd one
19/04/2021, 14:13 - Nischal Abraham: Yep
19/04/2021, 17:09 - Bee: Hi bb
19/04/2021, 17:10 - Bee: How's your day going? I'm eating dinner
19/04/2021, 17:27 - Nischal Abraham: Hey... Just came back upstairs. I don't want to jinx it but I think I feel worse than I did in the morning
19/04/2021, 17:28 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be free for a call anytime from now. You let me know when you are!
19/04/2021, 17:38 - Nischal Abraham: What's for dinner?

23/04/2021, 12:24 - Nischal Abraham: Well after lunch I was thinking of coding some, then exercise and a shower, join the prayer meeting and talk to you after
23/04/2021, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: 🤣🤣
23/04/2021, 12:30 - Nischal Abraham: Learnt so much! Thanks Bee. I didn't know so many things I'd naturally do were incorrect

23/04/2021, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: Dry
23/04/2021, 12:44 - Bee: I'll see you at the prayer meeting
23/04/2021, 12:44 - Nischal Abraham: I thought you'd be tired enought to fall asleep even with a nap
23/04/2021, 12:45 - Bee: Okay. You'll eat it with rice or bread? Or tortilla wraps?
23/04/2021, 12:45 - Bee: If I take a nap now, I'll stay up at night because I know I've got a day off tomorrow. Which will end up with me sleeping in and wasting half my day off

23/04/2021, 13:53 - Nischal Abraham: Ah okay. I'm disconnected from Netflix so didn't know. But that's cool Bee! Congratulations 😊
23/04/2021, 17:15 - Bee: No nap = nap at 8

24/04/2021, 17:09 - Bee: Hey :)
24/04/2021, 17:10 - Bee: The water looks beautiful!!!!!!
24/04/2021, 17:10 - Bee: How was your experience?
24/04/2021, 17:10 - Bee: Not yet. In a bit
24/04/2021, 17:10 - Bee: I've been called for a morning shift tomorrow 😔
24/04/2021, 17:11 - Nischal Abraham: It was beautiful! I spun so many times but it was so serene 😌
24/04/2021, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: Oh no! You'll have to miss worship 🙁
24/04/2021, 17:12 - Bee: I've never been kayaking so I don't know if spinning is a good thing or bad. But the way you're sound, it's a bad thing?
24/04/2021, 17:12 - Bee: Yep :(
24/04/2021, 17:12 - Nischal Abraham: My first time today. And spinning isn't great... You want to be moving in a straight line
24/04/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Looked like the perfect day to go kayaking 😊
24/04/2021, 17:16 - Bee: Looking so handsome, bb. 😊
24/04/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: It really is. We were out in the water for an hour but I barely felt the time pass by
24/04/2021, 17:17 - Nischal Abraham: Will you be alright for a call tonight if you have a morning shift tomorrow?
24/04/2021, 17:18 - Bee: Will have to be a short call if that's okay...
24/04/2021, 17:18 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright Bee. Any call with you is loved
24/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Aww ☺️ I'll eat, take a shower, and then call?
24/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: In 25?
24/04/2021, 17:20 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be here!
24/04/2021, 17:20 - Bee: Cool

24/04/2021, 17:34 - Bee: Your camera is better than his ya
24/04/2021, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: His is an older phone
24/04/2021, 17:41 - Nischal Abraham: But his is also Samsung. I think he has an S10
24/04/2021, 17:56 - Bee: Photos from his phone have always looking really good
24/04/2021, 17:56 - Bee: Dude, I'm stuck pooping. Will need some more time.
24/04/2021, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Well maybe you just had my old phone for comparison before 😂
24/04/2021, 17:57 - Nischal Abraham: Take your time. Most things are better when not rushed through
24/04/2021, 17:58 - Bee: 💯 goes for pooping.
24/04/2021, 17:59 - Nischal Abraham: Especially at nights when you can take your time. It's the worst when I have to go just before work time 😞
24/04/2021, 18:00 - Bee: It is!!! I stopped going in the morning during morning shifts. It automatically shifts to night time
24/04/2021, 18:04 - Nischal Abraham: Thats good for you
24/04/2021, 19:25 - Bee: ❤️
24/04/2021, 22:57 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee. I'm praying for your day tomorrow. SHED was fun tonight! Timon and Arlene did an excellent job arranging cluedo over Zoom
24/04/2021, 22:58 - Nischal Abraham: I hope you find strength through your difficult hours. Although you may miss worship do spend time with God and His Word when you can
24/04/2021, 22:59 - Nischal Abraham: I'll be heading to Gareth's place in the morning and dont know what plans are for the rest of the day. I'll let you know as the day goes on
25/04/2021, 01:53 - Bee: Thank you nana 😊
25/04/2021, 01:53 - Bee: Cleudo over zoom sounds interesting!
25/04/2021, 01:54 - Bee: Couldn't this morning. Please pray that I do once I'm back
25/04/2021, 01:54 - Bee: Alright. Praying you have a spirit led and fun time with Gareth and fam 😊
25/04/2021, 08:24 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you. I'll be praying that you do.
Just remembered this morning that we have our family service today which goes on from 6:30pm to 7:30pm. I'm not sure we'll have time before that for a call 🙁
25/04/2021, 10:53 - Bee: That's alright. We'll talk tomorrow 😊
25/04/2021, 10:54 - Bee: Just got home from work. It was a light day today ☺️
25/04/2021, 10:54 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! That's good 😊
25/04/2021, 10:55 - Nischal Abraham: lunch, shower then nap?
25/04/2021, 10:56 - Bee: You know it 😂
25/04/2021, 10:57 - Nischal Abraham: Well I hope you have a restful day then! Let me know how it goes... Even if it's the usual
25/04/2021, 12:08 - Bee: I will tell you how it goes
25/04/2021, 15:53 - Nischal Abraham: Hi Bee!
25/04/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: How's the day been. I'm back at No 5 and got some time till the family service starts
25/04/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Let me know if you're free for a short call
25/04/2021, 16:24 - Bee: Hey! I'm having dinner. There's the 9pm prayer meet after
25/04/2021, 16:32 - Nischal Abraham: Thanks for that. I did forget the prayer meeting
25/04/2021, 17:07 - Nischal Abraham: Heyo! How was dinner?
25/04/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Hey!
25/04/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Was on a call with Abisha after prayer. After a loonngg time. Felt really nice
25/04/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Dinner was chappatis and potato bhajo
25/04/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Bhaji
25/04/2021, 18:01 - Bee: Free for a call?
25/04/2021, 18:21 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry for the abrupt call Bee :(
25/04/2021, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight if I don't get to message you before you go to bed later
25/04/2021, 18:22 - Nischal Abraham: Miss you loads ♥️
25/04/2021, 18:23 - Bee: Don't be sorry nana. Getting to see and hear for for even a minute is better than not getting to see you at all
25/04/2021, 18:23 - Bee: If you're free later and I'm up then maybe a call? I think you may have dinne plans with Timon though right
25/04/2021, 18:23 - Bee: Enjoy bb 😊
25/04/2021, 18:23 - Bee: I luuuuurrrvvee you.
25/04/2021, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: I'm done
25/04/2021, 19:35 - Nischal Abraham: Though it'll be a few min before I'm free for a call
25/04/2021, 19:36 - Nischal Abraham: If you want to head to bed that's fine
25/04/2021, 19:38 - Bee: To my second greatest blessing and absolute favourite human being, thank you for being you. Thank you for giving me the space and freedom to be me. I've gone over yesterday's conversation multiple times since and I'm amazed at how you handled it. I really wish I'd have spoken to you about it sooner. I'm sorry I didn't. I always thought that that should be a conversation we must have in person. But now I know. Thank you for loving me through all of it nana. It isn't possible for me to tell you how much it meant to me. How much you mean to me.
25/04/2021, 19:41 - Bee: I'm truly blessed to call you mine.
25/04/2021, 19:42 - Bee: Just looked at the time (and date). It's been a year and 8 months!!!!!!!!!! Looking back on each day with thanksgiving and looking forward to each day with faith and hope.
25/04/2021, 19:42 - Bee: How did it go?
25/04/2021, 19:42 - Bee: I'm really sleepy nana :(
25/04/2021, 19:43 - Bee: Night shifts from tomorrow :( will you be free for a short call before you go in to work? I'll be free then. Or maybe during your lunch break? And if either aren't possible, we can skip our call and try again on Tuesday 😊
25/04/2021, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: That's alright. It's quite late for you and you had a morning shift
25/04/2021, 19:45 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry you stayed up so long already
25/04/2021, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: I just got free now
25/04/2021, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: I should be free for a call before work. I'll message you in the morning when I'm up
25/04/2021, 19:46 - Nischal Abraham: It went well! We had a sock game that I'll have to explain on call
25/04/2021, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: There's no dinner plans. It was just packing stuff up and Timon and Gareth leaving that took a few min
25/04/2021, 19:48 - Bee: Dude whaaaa. Why are you sorry
25/04/2021, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: You're still up!!
25/04/2021, 19:48 - Bee: Okay. I'll be here 😊
25/04/2021, 19:48 - Nischal Abraham: Why?
25/04/2021, 19:48 - Bee: I am!!!!!!
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Bee: My bladder is keeping me up. I need to go pee.
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Haha okay. I'll read through your messages now
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Bee: What are your dinne plans?
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Didn't read them after seeing the one of a possible call 😂
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Toast and butter and jam probably
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Bee: Can I call you for 10 min after km done peeing?
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Had a heavy lunch
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Bee: I'm*
25/04/2021, 19:49 - Nischal Abraham: Yess!
25/04/2021, 19:50 - Bee: You were in the middle of telling me about your lunch
25/04/2021, 19:50 - Bee: Okay brb
25/04/2021, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: I was. Well it's just a bunch of food that tasted really good. And Timon tried to make dessert but today was a failed attempt 😅. So dessert wasn't all too great
25/04/2021, 19:51 - Nischal Abraham: Still an amazing meal
25/04/2021, 20:40 - Nischal Abraham: ♥️
25/04/2021, 20:41 - Nischal Abraham: I luuuuuvvee you too my Bee
25/04/2021, 20:41 - Bee: Hahaha! 😂
25/04/2021, 20:41 - Bee: My grandmother named me after him
25/04/2021, 20:41 - Bee: I’m awwwwing! 🥰

Thanking God for you two 
God bless!
25/04/2021, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: It was intentional!? 😮
25/04/2021, 20:42 - Bee: I don't know if she's joking or being serious. Hard to tell with Reenee sometimes
25/04/2021, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: Haha yea that's true 😂
25/04/2021, 20:42 - Bee: I see the absence of Rs 😂
25/04/2021, 20:42 - Nischal Abraham: I don't know what you're talking about...
25/04/2021, 20:42 - Bee: 😂
25/04/2021, 20:43 - Bee: Bye, kunjan?
25/04/2021, 20:43 - Nischal Abraham: Venda. You can name me something in Konkani
25/04/2021, 20:43 - Bee: Cool. I'll think of something by tomorrow.
25/04/2021, 20:44 - Nischal Abraham: Cool! Goodnight and sweet dreams love 😊
25/04/2021, 20:44 - Bee: Bye. ☺️
26/04/2021, 05:35 - Bee: Hi bb
26/04/2021, 05:36 - Bee: Done with breakfast. Spoke to Norah for a bit. We were sharing our lizard stories. Going out to buy a few things now
26/04/2021, 05:36 - Bee: Good morning for when you see this 😊
26/04/2021, 07:38 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon Bee!
26/04/2021, 07:38 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds like a fun morning to have
26/04/2021, 07:38 - Nischal Abraham: Did you sleep well?
26/04/2021, 07:38 - Nischal Abraham: I'm free for a call anytime from now
26/04/2021, 09:02 - Nischal Abraham: Enjoy your lunch Bee! Thank you for the short call 😁
26/04/2021, 09:13 - Bee: Thank you nana. :)
26/04/2021, 09:13 - Bee: Praying you have a productive and fulfilling day. That you finish all that you need to
26/04/2021, 09:53 - Nischal Abraham: Praying you're strengthened through your night shift. Hope it won't be too busy tonight
26/04/2021, 10:10 - Bee: Thank you 😊 cleaned the house, took a shower, washed my uniform, and sitting down to eat now
26/04/2021, 10:11 - Bee: I was watching a few reels in Instagram and I really want to do a first look with papa. I'll tell you about it when we talk okay.
26/04/2021, 10:11 - Bee: A wedding first look
26/04/2021, 10:11 - Bee: Byyyeee
26/04/2021, 10:13 - Nischal Abraham: I'll ask about it when we talk next
26/04/2021, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: How is your nap?
26/04/2021, 15:08 - Nischal Abraham: Had lunch with Gareth so couldn't call you then
26/04/2021, 15:53 - Bee: Hi nana
26/04/2021, 15:53 - Bee: Lovely nap. Just woke up
26/04/2021, 15:53 - Bee: Getting ready to leave
26/04/2021, 15:53 - Bee: That's alright nana
26/04/2021, 15:54 - Bee: Tomorrow morning before work if you're free?
26/04/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: I'd love to 😊. Well you decide after you come back
26/04/2021, 15:54 - Bee: Or during your lunch?
26/04/2021, 15:54 - Nischal Abraham: Don't wake up just for the call. If you're tired then rest
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Bee: Okay. I'll tell you tomorrow morning okay?
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Yep if I'm free I'll let you know
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Bee: Okay
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Bee: How's your day going?
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Looking forward to it
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Bee: Almost done with work no?
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Still packing envelopes
26/04/2021, 15:55 - Nischal Abraham: Almost. Still stuff left to do. It doesn't seem to end sometimes
26/04/2021, 15:57 - Bee: Aw. You know it will get over nana. Just this week that's so busy
26/04/2021, 16:13 - Bee: Leaving for work nana.
26/04/2021, 16:13 - Bee: Remember that you're much loved.
26/04/2021, 16:13 - Bee: Bye!
26/04/2021, 16:23 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you nana. You are in constant prayer for the night
26/04/2021, 21:42 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee... Just had a wonderful call for reading through Nehemiah
26/04/2021, 21:43 - Nischal Abraham: Its on days like these that the Spirit feels alive and encouraging. Its also days like these that the flesh tries to overtake me. I'm only saying this to you tonight so that when we talk next you can ask me how I am and I'll be forced to not avoid it
26/04/2021, 21:47 - Nischal Abraham: Sorry if this is more of a burden to you. If at any point it feels like I'm overstepping or its too much to handle do let me know. I want to be faithful, for all the love and grace I'm shown by God, and for love and grace I'm shown by you, and yet my mind twists such wicked notions and tries to bargain like the serpent did Eve. I should probably be writing this in my journal cause it feels like something I'd normally write in there but my journal is too easily hidden for matters of urgency
26/04/2021, 21:54 - Nischal Abraham: I've just been praying for God to remind me of His love, of love that is shown through you too. My mind tries hard to guilt me into rejecting it because I don't deserve it. I think of nights you've mentioned where you spend overthinking and I've related to them so much. I don't voice out these thoughts very often, partly cause the deed of sin overshadows all the build-up to it. A hundred thoughts both good and bad trying to pull my mind asway. It's the holiest nights that I've fallen in the past Bee. I'm so scared of living that again. I'm sorry again if this is all too much. I know you're at your night shift and must be dealing with problems far greater than my cribbing. I should be the one praying to uphold you and yet here I am trying to receive.
26/04/2021, 22:01 - Nischal Abraham: I have half a mind to delete these messages just so that I don't worry you, but I promised to be honest. You don't have to do anything about it. It helps just to have someone else hear this :). I'll message again when I'm up but if you're asleep that's alright. We can try and connect over lunchtime, I may possibly be alone then. And if none of it works out that's okay too. I know night shifts are tough, you are in the place God led you to be. And He will give you the strength to get through all the negative emotion of it. If you have to choose between a call with me and quiet time I hope your pick will always be conversation with your greatest gifter
26/04/2021, 22:03 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I'd never thought affection for a person could have such a physical reaction in my heart and mind, and I'm so blessed you lead me to feel things I've never felt before. Sorry for the long messages! Byeeee!!! ❤
27/04/2021, 05:39 - Bee: Hi Nischal 😊
Everything that you said resonates with me. It's the days when I'm feeling my best and most 'spiritual' that I fall the fastest and hardest. I know it's because I let my guard down. The devil is a roaring lion. The verse that calls him a roaring lion also asks us to be alert and sober minded. Easy for me to say but oh so difficult to implement.
I will ask you about it when we talk nana. And it's not a burden to me. I don't think it will ever be but in case it does, you'll be the second one to know. Also, you're not overstepping. I'll tell you if you do.
27/04/2021, 05:42 - Bee: Your cribbing (although I wouldn't call it that) is welcome here nana. You make much prayer for me. What I keep sharing should be called cribbing and you're always there. Allow me to serve you.
27/04/2021, 05:47 - Bee: Last night wasn't too busy. It was a good night :)).
27/04/2021, 05:48 - Bee: I'll let you know if I'm up when you're up okay
27/04/2021, 05:48 - Bee: Or during your lunch break
27/04/2021, 05:48 - Bee: Going to bed now
27/04/2021, 05:48 - Bee: Bye my precious ❤️❤️
27/04/2021, 05:48 - Bee: DON'T BE SORRY PLEASE
27/04/2021, 05:49 - Bee: ☺️☺️☺️☺️
P.s. wait until you hug me. Okay bye.
27/04/2021, 08:02 - Nischal Abraham: Good afternoon!! I don't expect you to wake up anytime soon if you went to bed just over 2 hours ago
27/04/2021, 08:03 - Nischal Abraham: Thank you for your loving replies Bee. It puts my heart at ease. Blessed beyond measure to have you be so understanding 😊
27/04/2021, 08:04 - Nischal Abraham: So glad to hear it! I hope you get enough rest in the day for tonight as well
27/04/2021, 08:05 - Nischal Abraham: I'll let you know what my lunch break looks like. And if I don't message at all till my 2pm then assume I had company. I don't want to but I've missed out on messaging on time before
27/04/2021, 08:07 - Nischal Abraham: You warm my heart. But I don't think my feeling to apologize will go away just because I want it to. Maybe one day these things will just be known and understood by us and we don't feel guilty for what we share (by we I mean me)
27/04/2021, 08:08 - Nischal Abraham: I'm waiting, rather impatiently but waiting still
27/04/2021, 08:51 - Bee: Hi
27/04/2021, 10:25 - Bee: Maybe you'll disagree butI'm half as understanding as you are
27/04/2021, 10:25 - Bee: By we you must mean me too.
27/04/2021, 10:26 - Bee: Had fish curry, bhindi sabji for lunch. Jason cooked
27/04/2021, 10:26 - Bee: Watched some Kim's convenience. And now I'm going to sleep again
27/04/2021, 12:02 - Bee: Nischal please pray for me. I'm finding it hard to fall asleep. But I'm soo tired
27/04/2021, 12:02 - Nischal Abraham: Praying Bee
27/04/2021, 12:03 - Bee: Thank you. I thought it might be because of the heatm turned the AC on. But still can't fall asleep
27/04/2021, 12:03 - Bee: Btw
27/04/2021, 12:03 - Bee: Bye
27/04/2021, 12:06 - Nischal Abraham: Bye! That's a long time not falling asleep :(. Praying earnestly you do get sleep
27/04/2021, 12:47 - Nischal Abraham: Hey! I hope you managed to fall asleep and stay asleep till you need to go. I'm heading up to have lunch now. The office is quiet and empty today
27/04/2021, 12:48 - Nischal Abraham: Annie's off to deliver prizes to schools and Noel just went home as well. I'll probably see Annie after lunch now
27/04/2021, 16:02 - Bee: I fell asleep around 5. Just woke up
27/04/2021, 16:02 - Bee: Will get ready and leave in 5
27/04/2021, 16:02 - Nischal Abraham: Oh. I was thinking you must be late for work
27/04/2021, 16:02 - Bee: In 10
27/04/2021, 16:02 - Bee: What's up?
27/04/2021, 16:03 - Bee: I will be if I don't hurry

28/04/2021, 05:56 - Bee: I'll message you when I'm up? I want to apologize for being unable to give you fixed time for our call but I won't. I know you understand. Thank you.
28/04/2021, 05:57 - Bee: Enjoy being by yourself in the bed until you're not because I'm one to hog bed space.

28/04/2021, 05:58 - Bee: Good morning!

28/04/2021, 10:22 - Bee: I'll call?
28/04/2021, 13:46 - Bee: I've been called for overtime Nischal. And I've slept for only 4.5 hours 😭
28/04/2021, 13:47 - Bee: Was finding it hard to fall asleep after lunch and around 5 I got the message that I need to go early. Haven't slept only
28/04/2021, 13:49 - Bee: Please pray for strength and for me to have a light patient assignment today. And for the whole ICU as well
28/04/2021, 14:06 - Nischal Abraham: That sounds terrible. What time do you have to go in?
28/04/2021, 14:07 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying nana. Cast your burdens on Jesus and he'll carry you through

28/04/2021, 20:59 - Nischal Abraham: Had way too much pasta for dinner. Wanted to finish my leftover brocolli and then it tasted good so I just kept eating 😂
28/04/2021, 21:00 - Nischal Abraham: I've been able to steer clear of Instagram and YouTube for most of the day!!
28/04/2021, 21:03 - Nischal Abraham: Going through some coding tutorials right now. The urge to waste time watching YouTube videos is strong. Im just telling myself that my Bee is working hard and so should i
28/04/2021, 21:04 - Nischal Abraham: Well the thought process in my head is more complicated than that but that's the gist of it
28/04/2021, 21:08 - Nischal Abraham: I miss you so much Bee. I wish there was more I could do to help you through your busy schedule but prayer is all I have, and I know it's the best I could do.
28/04/2021, 21:09 - Nischal Abraham: I'm glad for our short calls today. Days I get to see your face feel extra special
28/04/2021, 21:11 - Nischal Abraham: I know I've said this multiple times but I hope your night is light. If you're not up for a call in the morning we'll talk at a later time. Just 2 more nights to go!!
28/04/2021, 21:59 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight Bee! I won't be sleeping immediately but I'll be switching off my WiFi. 
I'm surprised every day by the extent that love for you captivates me. Today was just another one of those days thinking back on how amazing and incredible it is to think I'm in a relationship with you!!
28/04/2021, 22:02 - Nischal Abraham: Did I say I miss you. Cause I do. A lot. Anyway byee. Praying you get amazing sleep once you're back as well!
29/04/2021, 05:50 - Bee: Hey ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
29/04/2021, 05:50 - Bee: Papa dropped me off 😊😶
29/04/2021, 05:50 - Bee: Ignore the 😶
29/04/2021, 05:51 - Bee: Wow. That good? Was it with a sauce? Or the garlic thing that you make?
29/04/2021, 05:51 - Bee: Good job, you!!!
29/04/2021, 05:52 - Bee: Aww Nischal. Tbh there are days that I don't work too hard tho.
29/04/2021, 05:53 - Bee: Tell me when we talk/!!
29/04/2021, 05:54 - Bee: Praying for me is the best thing you can do for me 😊 unless you get into nursing and start working in Bethany's ICU because then we'll have one staff more. Jk. Praying is always the best
29/04/2021, 05:54 - Bee: Dude how come you're reading my mind dude
29/04/2021, 05:55 - Bee: It was kinda light. But I made a mistake and I can't stop thinking about it. Not a major mistake that may affect the outcome of a patient's condition but a mistake nonetheless. I'll tell you about it when we talk okay
29/04/2021, 05:56 - Bee: Thank you, my dearest Nischal. You leave me speechless.
29/04/2021, 05:57 - Bee: I'm gonna go to sleep now. Will message you when I'm up okay. Don't know what time that'll be. I hope I sleep for at least 5 hours straight
29/04/2021, 05:57 - Bee: Good morning precious 😊
29/04/2021, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: I made it with mushrooms and brocolli
29/04/2021, 08:26 - Nischal Abraham: Haha... Well I can't draw inspiration from that. I do plenty of that myself 😂
29/04/2021, 08:27 - Nischal Abraham: Better start studying now if I'm to help you in 5 years. Looks like we'll have to put off any marriage plans till then
29/04/2021, 08:28 - Nischal Abraham: Okay! I'll ask when we talk
29/04/2021, 08:29 - Nischal Abraham: I'm praying that you do Bee! Maybe even 6 hours

29/04/2021, 12:00 - Bee: I got 5 hours of sleep until now!!!! Woke up around 2 but forced myself to go back to sleep. Then woke up at 4 and had lunch. Papa offered to feed me and I'm so thankful because otherwise I would've taken an hour to eat. I'm so tired.
29/04/2021, 12:00 - Bee: Going back to sleep now nana
29/04/2021, 12:14 - Bee: Did I tell you that you're the bomb? Because you are.
29/04/2021, 13:05 - Nischal Abraham: Don't think I've heard that one before. I hope it's not a reflection on my temperament
29/04/2021, 13:07 - Nischal Abraham: So glad you got 5 hours! Rest up till you have to go again. Just 2 more nights to go Bee!
29/04/2021, 15:46 - Bee: Hey!
29/04/2021, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Glad to see you're up. I keep worrying you'll oversleep and be late one of these days 😂
29/04/2021, 15:46 - Nischal Abraham: Do you feel better now?
29/04/2021, 15:47 - Bee: I slept for 8 hours!!! Feels like I could sleep some more but I don't feel too tired
29/04/2021, 15:47 - Bee: Somewhat yesss

01/05/2021, 22:35 - Nischal Abraham: Hey Bee! I got some progress on the Fairview website designs. Quite basic but I think it'll be better that way
01/05/2021, 22:36 - Nischal Abraham: And spent a lot of time on my site as well. Keep losing track of time when I sit down for it. Missed Bible reading today unfortunately
01/05/2021, 22:36 - Nischal Abraham: Missing you deeply. Deep seems to be an appropriate expression to use and yet it doesn't even come close to how it feels when I think about you
01/05/2021, 22:37 - Nischal Abraham: Thanking God for every blessing and every instance of His mercy. Especially for unseen and unknown ones. Invited to Noel's place for lunch tomorrow. Don't have a cold this time to force me head back to No 5 early
01/05/2021, 22:38 - Nischal Abraham: How's my Bee doing? You must be so tired after your shift 🙁. I hope you get to catch up on your sleep and rest when you get back
01/05/2021, 22:39 - Nischal Abraham: Don't reply to all my messages. If you've read them that's enough 😊. And if you're too tired for that I'll read them out to you when we talk. Whenever we talk
01/05/2021, 22:40 - Nischal Abraham: unknwnlistener.github.io if you want to check progress. Though it isn't optimized for phones so you'll have to switch to desktop view and pan around to see it
01/05/2021, 22:45 - Nischal Abraham: Goodnight and sweet dreams Bee! Switch on the AC if it's too hot. I think you'll like it better than the risk of waking up to lack of noise
02/05/2021, 09:18 - Bee: Hey ☺️
02/05/2021, 09:19 - Bee: I stayed up for worship and family hour. I want to attend youth meeting (at 2) as well but my eyes won't let me
02/05/2021, 09:20 - Bee: My heart longed for fellowship and is so satisfied nana
02/05/2021, 09:20 - Nischal Abraham: That's amazing! You must be so tired though
02/05/2021, 09:20 - Bee: Gonna have my Sunday nap with a full belly 😴
02/05/2021, 09:20 - Bee: I am exhausted
02/05/2021, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: Haha sounds lovely. Enjoy your family lunch and sleep Bee 😊
02/05/2021, 09:21 - Bee: Will you share the link please? Not immediately
02/05/2021, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: I think it'll be more than just a nap
02/05/2021, 09:21 - Nischal Abraham: Will do
02/05/2021, 09:21 - Bee: I hope not ya. Then I'll be up at night
02/05/2021, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: There's a very selfish thought in my head of is being able to talk longer cause of it. But it'd be much better for you to get a full night's sleep
02/05/2021, 09:22 - Nischal Abraham: Tell someone to wake you up maybe?
02/05/2021, 09:22 - Bee: I've loved reading your messages after night shifts Nischal. Thank you for taking the time to send detailed updates each day 😊
02/05/2021, 09:23 - Bee: Bro my family won't wake me up unless I really need to wake up. I haven't been kind to them in their past attempts at waking me up
02/05/2021, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: 😂😂
02/05/2021, 09:24 - Nischal Abraham: I guess you'll have to rely on an alarm then
02/05/2021, 09:26 - Bee: I'll reply to your messages later if that's okay
02/05/2021, 09:26 - Bee: I know you won't mind.
02/05/2021, 09:26 - Bee: I won't say sorry thank you and all
02/05/2021, 09:27 - Nischal Abraham: I love it 😊. Take your time going through it. Sending you updates helps me too. To be mindful of the time I spend during the day
02/05/2021, 09:30 - Nischal Abraham: Sleep well my Bee! Hopefully I'll be online when you're up. If not, I'll read your messages when I am
02/05/2021, 09:40 - Bee: Praying for you and your day nana. Looking forward to whenever we talk next. Let me know if you're free for a call tonight. Bye!

02/05/2021, 19:14 - Bee: Canoeing sounds like fun 😊 I'm so glad you get to have these experiences with wonderful people :))
02/05/2021, 19:15 - Nischal Abraham: Not sure when I will be back nana. If you want to head to bed then you should do that
02/05/2021, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: And just as I say that I'm back
02/05/2021, 19:17 - Nischal Abraham: If you're heading to bed that's alright
02/05/2021, 19:18 - Nischal Abraham: It was a fun day for me!
02/05/2021, 19:30 - Nischal Abraham: Finally settled down. My socks were wet and so is the sleeves of my hoodie

03/05/2021, 08:19 - Nischal Abraham: Goodl morning!
03/05/2021, 08:20 - Bee: Woke up early, bought groceries and ran some errands, made a surprise visit to Kitto and Ella's with red velvet cheesecake which I was craving since the moment I woke up. Played for a bit, danced a bit, ate a bit (including some of the 'birthday' cheesecake) and back home prepping for linch
03/05/2021, 08:20 - Bee: Lunch
03/05/2021, 08:20 - Bee: Like Liddl?
03/05/2021, 08:21 - Nischal Abraham: Twas a typo

03/05/2021, 08:34 - Nischal Abraham: You said birthday cake. Whose birthday is it?
03/05/2021, 08:35 - Bee: Nobody's. But if there's a cake, it must be somebody's birthday. Kid logic 🤷🏽‍♀️
03/05/2021, 08:35 - Bee: You must be getting ready for work no. No need to reply okay
03/05/2021, 08:36 - Nischal Abraham: No that's alright. If I'm too busy to reply I wouldn't be replying

03/05/2021, 08:40 - Nischal Abraham: Sounds good! Are you eating now? You don't have to reply if you're busy
03/05/2021, 08:42 - Bee: Nope not eating. Chopping Alsande so that we can cook and keep it for next time. It will get spoilt in a two days otherwise
03/05/2021, 08:42 - Bee: <Media omitted>
03/05/2021, 08:43 - Nischal Abraham: How are you chopping and typing? 😂
03/05/2021, 08:43 - Nischal Abraham: That just looks like beans!
03/05/2021, 08:43 - Bee: But they don't taste like beans
03/05/2021, 08:43 - Bee: I'm taking breaks man

03/05/2021, 08:50 - Bee: I wasn't sweating then
03/05/2021, 08:51 - Bee: Or maybe the polite way of saying that I've got oily skin? 🤦🏽‍♀️🤔
03/05/2021, 08:51 - Bee: *🤔
03/05/2021, 08:51 - Nischal Abraham: You look beautiful always Bee ☺️
