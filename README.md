### Feature Ideas

- [ ] Filter out meta messages - (text === undefined), (<Media omitted>)
- [ ] Colour scheme/palette selector
- [x] Dynamic parsing of text file for new messages on scroll (~~lazy load~~)
  - [x] Lazy loading is bad. What you want is windowing (like Twitter)
- [ ] separate "Settings" section for

  - [ ] setting color values
  - [ ] Font-size adjustments
  - [ ] Background image selection?
  - [ ] Sliced number of messages to show

- [ ] Loader while file is being parsed
- [ ] Switching view of sender and receivers
- [ ] Star/Bookmark feature for messages
- [x] Load in whatsapp chats through file uploads
  - [ ] Default sample chat conversation
- [ ] Map the people in conversation to different variables -- Future reading for Group Chats
- [ ] Sticky the date as scroll happens
